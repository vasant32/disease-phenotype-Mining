<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors affecting surgeons' decisions to refer older patients for adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN/SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: A self-administered survey was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Australian and New Zealand colorectal surgeons (n = 146) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The survey consisted of 3 sections: 1) knowledge of research evidence, 2) opinions on evidence and adjuvant therapy in older patients, and 3) self-reported practice, or likelihood of patient referral in different scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic information was also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy percent of surgeons responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgeons were significantly less likely to refer older patients than younger patients for adjuvant therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scenarios (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in referral recommendations was greatest when patients lived a long way from treatment, had a comorbid condition, or had little social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was greater variation in referral recommendations for older patients, and marked disagreement between surgeons in knowledge and opinion questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgeon age was the only significant predictor of survey responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Greater knowledge and more positive opinions predicted similar referral recommendations for older and younger patients (P = .02, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Although decreased referral and receipt of adjuvant therapy among older patients is most likely multifactorial, this survey focused on the views of one physician group and a number of specific scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chronological age alone appears to impact colorectal surgeons' decisions to refer patients for adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic and physiological factors further decrease the likelihood of referral of older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A lack of consensus among surgeons suggests that more research is needed both to predict how older patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> will react to treatment, and to determine how information from emerging evidence can be best used to assist physicians' treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
