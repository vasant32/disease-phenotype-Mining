<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Exact data on the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we designed a study to investigate the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> and associated risk factors in an adult general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, consecutive patients were included in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They attended the Austrian national wide health care program for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening at four medical institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A flexible colonoscopy and detailed examination were conducted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemorrhoids</z:e> were defined according to a standardized grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent variables included baseline characteristics, sociodemographic data, and health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Potential risk factors were calculated by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 976 participants, 380 patients (38.93%) suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 277 patients (72.89%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> were classified as grade I, in 70 patients (18.42%) as grade II, in 31 patients (8.16%) as grade III, and in 2 patients (0.53%) as grade IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy patients (44.74%) complained about symptoms associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e>, whereas 210 patients (55.26%) reported no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the univariate and multivariate analysis, body mass index (BMI) had a significant effect on the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> with p = 0.0391 and p = 0.0282, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even when correcting for other potential risk factors, an increase in the BMI of one increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> by 3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemorrhoids</z:e> occur frequently in the adult general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Notably, a considerable number of people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> do not complain about symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, a high BMI can be regarded as an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
