<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the accuracy of a serum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9) test in indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or its precursor conditions in a symptomatic population.Methods:Patients aged over 18, referred urgently or routinely to secondary care following primary care presentation with colorectal symptoms completed a questionnaire and provided a blood sample for serum MMP9 estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis and logistic regression modelling investigated the association between presenting symptoms, MMP9 measurements and the diagnostic outcome of patient investigations, in order to derive the combination of factors which best predicted a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>.Results:Data were analysed for 1002 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, male gender, absence of anal pain, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood in stools, urgent referral, previous bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bowel cancer</z:e> were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase 9 measurements were not found to be associated with significant colorectal pathology.Conclusion:This study, despite robust sampling protocols, showed no clear association between MMP9 and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase 9 therefore appears to have little value as a tool to aid referral decisions in the symptomatic population </plain></SENT>
