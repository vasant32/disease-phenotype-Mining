<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Student's t-test and the Ï‡(2)-test were used to estimate the predictive ability of these scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observed complication rate of 38.7% was not significantly different to the rate of 36.3% predicted by the POSSUM scoring system (observed : expected [O : E] ratio 1.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed mortality rate was 3.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For predicting mortality, POSSUM had an O : E ratio of 0.37, compared with p-POSSUM O : E ratio 1.00, cr-POSSUM O : E ratio 0.91, APACHE II O : E ratio 0.31 and ACPGBI O : E ratio 1.41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the POSSUM scoring system had high value for predicting the risk of morbidity following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For predicting postoperative mortality, p-POSSUM, cr-POSSUM and ACPGBI were superior to POSSUM and APACHE II, however ROC curve analysis showed that cr-POSSUM and ACPGI discriminated best between survivors and non-survivors, so were more accurate predictors of postoperative mortality than the other three scoring systems </plain></SENT>
