<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who received irinotecan combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> plus l-leucovorin (FOLFIRI) as first-line therapy were divided into two groups: those with UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype and those with UGT1A1*1/*6 or *1/*28 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy and toxicity were compared between these groups retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two patients (24 *1/*1 and 18 *1/*6 or *1/*28) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 48% in *1/*1 group and 56% in *1/*6 or *1/*28 group (P = 0.847) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 8.6 months in *1/*1 group and 8.5 months in *1/*6 or *1/*28 group (P = 0.888) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No hematologic or non-hematologic toxic effects were clearly related to UGT1A1*1/*6 or *1/*28 during the first cycle or throughout the entire course of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the efficacy or toxicity of FOLFIRI between patients with UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype and those with UGT1A1*1/*6 or *1/*28 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that patients with the latter genotypes can receive FOLFIRI at the same dose of irinotecan as those with the UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype receive </plain></SENT>
