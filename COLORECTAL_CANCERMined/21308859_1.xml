<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether a psychosocial rehabilitation course was effective in relieving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' distress and improving their well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with breast, prostate or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed within 2 years who had finished primary treatment were randomised to usual care or a 6-day residential course of lectures, discussions and peer groups on issues related to treatment and living with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in self-reported distress (POMS-Sf) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) from baseline to 1 and 6 months' follow-up were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for baseline scores of outcome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site, time since diagnosis, gender, age and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 507 patients, 452 were included in the analyses, 404 completed the 1-month and 394 the 6-month assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the control group showed greater decreases in total mood disturbance and subscales of the POMS-Sf and showed more improvement in emotional, cognitive and social functioning at both 1 and 6 months and in role functioning at 6 months than the intervention group </plain></SENT>
