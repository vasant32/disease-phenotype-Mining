<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Checklists or structured templates improve upon the presence of key parameters in histopathology reports, but data are lacking on long-term sustainability of such reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 2003 to 2006, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Society of Pathology collaborated on the development of a structured electronic template for histopathology reporting on colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate use and long-term effect of this structured template in one of the first laboratories implementing the template for routine diagnostic work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histopathology reports (n =123) in the 1-year period prior to implementation were evaluated with respect to presence of key parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histopathology reports (n =1186) in the 5-year period after implementation were evaluated with respect to template use and presence of key parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The electronic template had been used in 1089 (91.8%) of the 1186 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Template use was stable in the entire 5-year period, and had significantly improved upon the presence of data on 7 of 11 key parameters valid for both the pre-implementation and the post-implementation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight hundred and twenty-two (75.5%) of the 1089 template reports contained information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> key parameters, compared to just 20 (16.3%) of the 123 free text reports in the 1-year pre-implementation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electronic template reporting has a significant and sustainable long-term, positive effect upon the quality of histopathology reports </plain></SENT>
