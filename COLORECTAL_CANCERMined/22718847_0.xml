<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between its expression and the expression of E-cadherin and Ki-67 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, as well as its effect on patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated CADM4 expression in tissue microarrays of 513 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CADM4 was highly expressed in 210 of the 513 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>; expression was reduced in 185 cases and absent in the remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of CADM4 expression was correlated with larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size (6.2±2.1 cm vs 5.3±2.0 cm, p&lt;0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumour</z:e> type (61.5% vs 20.9%, p&lt;0.001), lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (31.4% vs 20.9%, p=0.022), higher Dukes stage (25.5% vs 19.6%, p=0.044), poorer differentiation (38.5% vs 18.8%, p&lt;0.001), absence of E-cadherin expression (28.5% vs 16.0%, p=0.007) and presence of Ki-67 expression (27.3% vs 12.3%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariable Cox regression analysis, absence of CADM4 expression was associated with poorer overall survival (HR 0.712; 95% CI 0.512 to 0.989, p=0.042) and disease-free survival (HR 0.732; 95% CI 0.546 to 0.981, p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model, CADM4 expression was not an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (HR 0.726; 95% CI 0.516 to 1.021, p=0.066) and disease-free survival (HR 0.762; 95% CI 0.563 to 1.033, p=0.080) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of CADM4 expression is relatively frequent in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> and patient survival </plain></SENT>
