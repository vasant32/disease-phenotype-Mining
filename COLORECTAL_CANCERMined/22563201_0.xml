<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) correlate with the presence of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and/or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> following radical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 413 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> underwent radical surgery between January 1998 and December 2002 in our department and were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 69 mo (range, 3-118 mo), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence was experienced by 90/413 (21.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of CEA were assayed preoperatively, and using a cutoff value of 5 ng/mL, patients were divided into two groups, those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum CEA levels (e.g., ≤ 5 ng/mL) and those with elevated CEA levels (&gt; 5 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of CEA for the detection of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 37.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of CEA according to stage, was 21.4%, 38.9%, and 41.7% for stages I-III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, for stage II and stage III cases, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were reduced for patients with elevated preoperative serum CEA levels (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity of CEA for detecting recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 54.4%, and sensitivity rates of 36.6%, 66.7%, and 75.0% were associated with cases of local recurrence, single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum levels of CEA preoperatively, the sensitivity of CEA for detecting recurrence was reduced compared with patients having a history of elevated CEA prior to radical resection (32.6% vs 77.3%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum CEA levels prior to resection maintained these levels during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence, especially in cases of local recurrence vs cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
