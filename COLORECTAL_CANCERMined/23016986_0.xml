<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Research focusing on female patients and on partners is also rather scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the preoperative sexual functioning, quality of sexual life, and relationship functioning for male and female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and their partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mean scores of the patients and partners were compared with mean norm scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (N = 136) and their partners (N = 106) were recruited before surgical treatment in six Dutch hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Men completed the International Index of Erectile Functioning, while women completed the Female Sexual Function Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> partnered participants completed the Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction and the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean scores were compared with mean norm scores derived from the manuals of the questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were in a heterosexual relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Female patients reported a lower quality of sexual life compared with male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Male partners reported a lower sexual functioning and a lower quality of sexual life compared with male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and partners (both sexes) reported a lower sexual functioning and a lower quality of sexual life compared with norm populations but scored similar on relationship functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A lower sexual functioning and a lower quality of sexual life are already reported preoperatively; however, relationship functioning was comparable with a norm population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the impairment seen after treatment should not be solely attributed to the effects of treatment </plain></SENT>
