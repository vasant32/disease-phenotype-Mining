<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence optical imaging is a promising technique to assess the extent of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> during curative-intended surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, NIR fluorescence imaging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> is highly challenging due to hepatic uptake and clearance of many fluorescent dyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the biodistribution and the ability to demarcate liver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> were assessed during surgery in a syngeneic rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using an integrin α(v)β(3)-directed NIR fluorescence probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> were induced in 7 male WAG/Rij rats by subcapsular inoculation of 0.5 × 10(6) CC531 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> rat cells into three distinct liver lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative and ex vivo fluorescence measurements were performed 24 (N = 3 rats, 7 tumors) and 48 h (N = 4 rats, 9 tumors) after intravenous administration of the integrin α(v)β(3)-directed NIR fluorescence probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> had a minimal two-fold higher NIR fluorescence signal than healthy liver tissue and other abdominal organs (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-background ratio was independent of time of imaging (24 h vs. 48 h post-injection; p = 0.31), which facilitates flexible operation planning in future clinical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total fluorescence intensity was significantly correlated with the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (R(2) = 0.92 for the 24 h group, R(2) = 0.96 for the 48 h group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854198" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intra-abdominal metastases</z:e> can be clearly demarcated during surgery using an integrin α(v)β(3) targeting NIR fluorescence probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Translating these findings to the clinic will have an excellent potential to substantially improve the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
