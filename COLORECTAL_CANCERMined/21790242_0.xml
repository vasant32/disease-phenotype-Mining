<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our target population comprised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such FDR, above 40 years of age, registered during the years 2003-2007, Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases was collected from Jordan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The screening study was conducted through two stages, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FDR were examined at their homes for any suggestive related symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, then those who were suspected to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were referred to hospital for confirmatory colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First degree relatives amounted to 3,574 subjects, 153 (4.3%) were complaining of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of them 58 (37.9%) did not accept colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The confirmation colonoscopy results for the remaining 95 (62.1%) indicated two confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy three percent of the suspected cases complained mainly from change in bowel habit and about one fifth felt cramping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study raised the question of cost effectiveness and cost benefits of running a nationwide screening program for such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in a developing country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand it highlights the importance of early detection activities in Jordan as it was the first study to be conducted among a community dwelling high risk population in the country </plain></SENT>
