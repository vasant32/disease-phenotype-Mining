<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 434 patients who underwent a curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677947" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage I colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 1999 and December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative oral chemotherapy was performed in 189 patients (45.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following prognostic factors were correlated with recurrence: age, gender, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, T stage, size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, histologic differentiation, growth pattern, and lymphovascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 65 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate was 4.6% (20/434) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to recurrence was 33 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the recurrence occurred more than two years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors associated with recurrence were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (P = 0.009), T2 stage (P = 0.010), and infiltrative growth pattern (P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that the infiltrative growth pattern was an independent predictor for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell budding was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathologic reviews with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up is necessary for stage I colorectal patients with high risk factors like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, T2 stage, and infiltrative growth pattern </plain></SENT>
