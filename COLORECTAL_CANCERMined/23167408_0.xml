<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dietary patterns involve complex interactions of food and nutrients summarizing the total diet or key aspects of the diet for a population under study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: This review involves 6 cohort studies of dietary patterns and their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An exploratory or a posteriori approach and a hypothesis-oriented or a priori approach were employed to identify dietary patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dietary pattern identified to be protective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was healthy, prudent, fruits and vegetables, fat reduced/diet foods, vegetables/fish/poultry, fruit/wholegrain/dairy, healthy eating index 2005, alternate healthy eating index, Mediterranean score and recommended food score </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Western dietary pattern which mainly consists of red and processed meat and refined grains is associated with an elevated risk of development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
