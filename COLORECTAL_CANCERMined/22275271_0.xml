<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism involved in mediating this effect is not yet fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we found the overexpression of type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in established colorectal <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific siRNA of IGF-IR decreases cell proliferation, exert synergistic effect with anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The downstream signaling of IGF-IR, PI3K/AKT pathway, was altered upon IGF-IR silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) was suppressed due to the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the intracellular drug concentration was increased and the drug-resistant phenotype was reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings improve current understanding of the biology of IGF-IR and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> and have significant therapeutic implications on colorectal <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
