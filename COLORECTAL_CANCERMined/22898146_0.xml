<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However these tests have been criticised for their fairly low sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this reason attention has been given to alternative tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to review the evidence for screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using qualitative immunochemical faecal occult blood tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the complete range of tested cut-off values, immunochemical faecal occult blood tests lead to higher diagnostic yield, improved sensitivity and greater participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimal number of samples and the optimal cut-off value has to suit local resources and the acceptability of missed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> economic evaluations, despite some differences between studies, add further arguments to support the opinion that the immunochemical faecal occult blood test is currently the most cost-effective screening test for average-risk populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These economic evaluations provide strong arguments in favour of the 1-sample strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With decreasing the cut-off value similar performances can be achieved with one-compared to two day sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Too few data are currently available to accurately compare existing qualitative tests </plain></SENT>
