<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Delays in diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are one of the most common reasons for malpractice claims and lead to poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they are not well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We used a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach to analyze postreferral colonoscopy delays in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and explored referring physician's perception of processes surrounding these delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two physician-raters conducted independent electronic health record reviews of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases in a large integrated safety-net system to determine postreferral colonoscopy delays, which we defined as failures to perform colonoscopy within 60 days of referral for an established indication(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To explore perceptions of colonoscopy processes, we conducted semistructured interviews with a sample of primary care physicians (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) and used a content analysis approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 104 CRC cases that met inclusion criteria, reviewers agreed on the presence of postreferral colonoscopy delays in 35 (33.7%) cases; Îº = 0.99 (95% CI, 0.83-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time between first referral and completion of colonoscopy was 123.0 days (range 62.0-938.0; interquartile range = 90.0 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In about two-thirds of instances (64.8%), the reason for delay was a delayed future appointment with the gastroenterology service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On interviews, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> attributed long delays in scheduling to reduced endoscopic capacity and inefficient processes related to colonoscopy referral and scheduling, including considerable ambiguity regarding referral guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many suggested that navigation models be applied to streamline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postreferral delays in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis are potentially preventable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive mixed-methods methodology might be useful for others to identify the steps in the diagnostic process that are in most need for improvement </plain></SENT>
