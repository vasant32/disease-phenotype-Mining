<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection could be a curative treatment for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> without the possibility of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, if the resection margin is positive, and there is a risk of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, additional surgery should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of patients who underwent additional surgery to determine risk factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study is a retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We evaluated 85 patients who underwent additional surgery with curative intent after endoscopic resection for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea, between January 2001 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We identified risk factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> or lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in surgical specimens after noncurative endoscopic resection for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 85 patients who underwent additional surgery after noncurative endoscopic resection, 76 (89.4%) had submucosal invasion greater than 1000 Î¼m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (24.7%) and 25 patients (29.4%) had a positive lateral or vertical resection margin, and 11 patients (12.9%) had inadequate lifting sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After additional surgery, patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> and/or lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups in positive lateral margin, but there was a significant difference in positive vertical margin (p = 0.015 with an OR of 15.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with inadequate lifting sign, the OR was 13.68 (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a greater need for additional surgery in cases with positive vertical resection margin or inadequate lifting sign, because the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> is higher than in other cases </plain></SENT>
