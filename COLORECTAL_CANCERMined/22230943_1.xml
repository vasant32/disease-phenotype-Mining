<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the qualitative and quantitative detection of CTC in the central (CVBC) and mesenteric (MVBC) venous blood compartments to elucidate the patterns of hematogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell dissemination in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 200 patients were enrolled prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-draining vein and via a central venous line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CTCs were detected and quantified by using the CellSearch system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with CTC detection in both compartments were analyzed by using univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTC analyses were performed in the CVBC and MVBC in 200 and 80 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTCs were found at a higher rate (P=0.01) and at a higher count (P=0.006) in the MVBC compared with the CVBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analyses, stage IV disease (odds ratio, 3.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-10.35) and increased preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level (odds ratio, 3.57; 1.30-9.79) were associated with CTC detection in the CVBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTCs were detected more frequently (P=0.05) and at higher numbers (P=0.05) in the CVBC of patients with low compared with mid or high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative and quantitative detection of CTCs is higher in the MVBC compared with the CVBC of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
