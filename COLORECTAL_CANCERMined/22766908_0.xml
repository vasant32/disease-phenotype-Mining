<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation software dedicated for computed tomography (CT) dosimetry was used to determine absorbed doses to primarily exposed radiosensitive organs of 31 women and 29 men subjected to screening CTC on a 256-slice CT scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effective dose was estimated from (a) organ dose data and (b) dose-length product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Organ-specific and total LARs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were estimated using published risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative LARs from repeated CTC studies on individuals participating in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program were compared with corresponding lifetime intrinsic risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean organ dose-derived effective dose was estimated to be 2.92 and 2.61 mSv for female and male individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose-length product method was found to overestimate effective dose from CTC by 26% and 13% in female and male individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with previously published results for 64-slice CT scanners, 256-slice CTC was found to be associated with up to 45% less radiation burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative LAR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751366" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">radiation-induced cancer</z:e> from repeated quinquennial screening CTC studies between the ages of 50 and 80 years was estimated to increase the lifetime intrinsic risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by less than 0.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The level of patient radiation burden and theoretical radiogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks associated with screening CTC performed using modern low-dose protocols and techniques may not justify disapproval of CTC as a mass screening tool </plain></SENT>
