<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic values of ex vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of SLN micrometastasis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens were obtained during radical resections and the SLN was identified by injecting a 1% isosulfan blue solution submucosally and circumferentially around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> within 30 min after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first node to stain blue was defined as the SLN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLNs negative by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE) staining were further examined for micrometastasis using cytokeratin IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 54 patients between 25 and 82 years of age were enrolled, including 32 males and 22 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 70% of patients were T3 or above, about 86% of patients were stage II or III, and approximately 90% of patients had lesions grade II or above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sentinel lymph nodes were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 32 patients in whom no lymph node micrometastasis were detected by HE staining and 22 patients with positive lymph nodes micrometastasis detected by HE staining in non-SLNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast only 7 SLNs stained positive with HE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using HE examination as the standard, the sensitivity, non-detection rate, and accuracy rate of SLN micrometastasis detection were 31.8% (7/22), 68.2% (15/22), and 72.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Micrometastasis were identified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in 4 of the 32 patients with HE-negative stained lymph nodes, resulting in an upstaging rate 12.5% (4/32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients who were upstaged consisted of 2 stage I patients and 2 stage II patients who were upstaged to stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Those without lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> by HE staining who were upstaged by IHC detection of micrometastasis had a significantly poorer disease-free survival (p = 0.001) and overall survival (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ex vivo localization and immunohistochemical detection of sentinel lymph node micrometastasis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> can upgrade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, and may become a factor affecting prognosis and guiding treatment </plain></SENT>
