<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Minimal data exists describing the impact of physical activity on colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> risk in United States minority populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of exercise on the prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in a multiethnic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We enrolled 982 patients: 558 Hispanic, 202 Asian,149 Black, and 69 White </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who reported exercising one or more hours weekly had a lower prevalence of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (25.3% vs 33.2%, P = 0.008) as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (13.8 vs. 18.9%, P = 0.03) compared to those who did not exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Black and Hispanic patients and those who were overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> also had lower prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> if they led an active lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that age &gt;55, male sex, and Black race/ethnicity were positively associated with the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, while a history of exercising one hour or more weekly was an independent negative predictor for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> anywhere in the colon (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.4 - 0.9, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exercising one hour per week was associated with a lower prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> when compared to those who exercised less or not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An active lifestyle provides benefits to groups who are at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, such as Blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also provides significant protection to overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Public health initiatives should promote physical activity as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention tool in multiethnic populations </plain></SENT>
