<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the expression of these molecules in 183 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue specimens and explore their effect in both clinicopathological parameters and disease prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also utilize our previous results regarding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-Met, CD44v6, and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase, in an attempt to further clarify their distinct role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> prognosis and their crosstalk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caveolin-1 was more freely distributed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of the right colon and restricted towards the left and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> samples (p = 0.022); VEGFR-3 was associated with higher nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>' status (p = 0.001) and staging (p = 0.006), and loss of VEGFR-1 predicted distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.026) and advanced stage (p = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prompted by previous reports, we performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses also in the patient group of early (I and II) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage where it was evident that VEGFR-1 was more frequently expressed in patients under 60 years old (p = 0.014) and VEGFR-3 was significantly elevated in left <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> (p = 0.039) and female patients (p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the advanced stage (III and IV), the absence of VEGFR-1 exhibited a tendency for higher M status (p = 0.067) and lack of caveolin-1 signified worse AJCC classification (p = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patient survival was influenced from VEGFR-3 (p = 0.019) for the whole sample, whereas subgroup analyses provided a correlation between caveolin-1 expression and improved survival in the early detection group of patients (p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using Cox regression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available markers, EGFR, CD44v6, and VEGFR-1 emerged in this study as potential surrogate markers, the latter having positive prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further explored the multiple receptor correlations that were identified </plain></SENT>
