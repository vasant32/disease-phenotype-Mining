<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the impact of peri-operative systemic chemotherapy timing on outcome following resection of CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 676 patients who underwent surgery for CRLM were identified from two hepatobiliary center databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected and analyzed utilizing multivariate, matched, and propensity-score analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was 2 and median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 3.3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>334 patients (49.4%) received pre-operative chemotherapy while 342(50.6%) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment was resection only (n = 555; 82.1%; minor hepatectomy, n = 399; 59.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While there was no difference in morbidity following minor liver resection (pre-operative chemotherapy: 17.9% versus no pre-operative chemotherapy: 16.5%; P = 0.72), morbidity was higher after major hepatic resection (pre-operative chemotherapy: 23.1% versus no pre-operative chemotherapy: 14.2%; P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with pre-operative chemotherapy had worse 5-year survival (43%) as compared to patients not treated with pre-operative chemotherapy (55%)(P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Controlling for baseline characteristics, pre-operative chemotherapy was not associated with outcome on multivariate (HR = 1.04, P = 0.87) or propensity-score analysis (HR = 1.40, P = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pre-operative chemotherapy was associated with a trend toward increased morbidity among patients undergoing a major hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Receipt of pre-operative chemotherapy was associated with neither an advantage nor disadvantage in terms of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
