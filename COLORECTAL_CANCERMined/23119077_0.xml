<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Guatemala is currently undergoing an epidemiologic transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preventive services are key to reducing the burden of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e>, and smoking counseling and cessation are among the most cost-effective and wide-reaching strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Internal medicine physicians are fundamental to providing such services, and their knowledge is a cornerstone of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable disease</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 to evaluate knowledge of clinical preventive services for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interns, residents, and attending physicians of the internal medicine departments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> teaching hospitals in Guatemala completed a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants' responses were contrasted with the Guatemalan Ministry of Health (MoH) prevention guidelines and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis compared knowledge of recommendations within and between hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In response to simulated patient scenarios, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> services were recommended by more than half of physicians regardless of MoH or USPSTF recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prioritization was adequate according to the MoH guidelines but not including other potentially effective services (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> disorder screenings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the exception of colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> screening, less frequently recommended by interns, there was no difference in recommendation rates by level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Guatemalan internal medicine physicians' knowledge on preventive services recommendations for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> is limited, and prioritization did not reflect cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on these data we recommend that preventive medicine training be strengthened and development of evidence-based guidelines for low-middle income countries be a priority </plain></SENT>
