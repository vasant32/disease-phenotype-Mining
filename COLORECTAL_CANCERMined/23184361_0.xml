<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Professional societies recommend posttreatment surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the use of surveillance over time, with a particular focus on racial/ethnic disparities, and also examines the role of area characteristics, such as capacity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, on surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data were used to identify individuals aged 66 to 85 years who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 1993 to 2005 and treated with surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study examined factors associated with subsequent receipt of a colonoscopy, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing, primary care (PC) visits, and a composite measure of overall surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of eligible subjects, 61.0% had a colonoscopy, 68.0% had CEA testing, 77.1% had PC visits, and 43.0% received overall surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, blacks were less likely than whites to undergo colonoscopy (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69-0.83) and to receive CEA testing and overall surveillance, whereas white/Hispanic rates did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcomes increased from 1993 to 2005, but black/white disparities remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals in areas with greatest capacity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were more likely (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.18) to receive colonoscopy, and those in areas with the greatest percentage of blacks were less likely (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.83-0.95) to receive colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those living in areas with shortage of PC were less likely to receive PC visits (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.48-0.64) and overall surveillance (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.71-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors do not get recommended surveillance, and black/white disparities in rates of surveillance have not improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of the area where an individual lives contribute to the use of surveillance </plain></SENT>
