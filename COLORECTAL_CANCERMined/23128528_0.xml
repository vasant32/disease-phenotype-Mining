<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated from 111 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 46 matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa samples from the same patients, obtained at primary surgery and DNA methylation was examined by PyrosequencingÂ® </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up time was up to 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients showed partial promoter methylation in the following frequencies: O6-MGMT, 34%; p14ARF, 29%; p16INK4a, 28%; RASSF1A, 14%; and APC1A, 27% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation of one or more of the genes from the set p14ARF, RASSF1A and APC1A, was significantly (p=0.021) associated with worse prognosis even adjusting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and differentiation (RR 2.2, p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, DNA methylation of the p14ARF, RASSF1A and APC1A genes, diagnosed by Pyrosequencing, defines a poor prognosis subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients independently of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and differentiation </plain></SENT>
