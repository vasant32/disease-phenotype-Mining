<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A major factor limiting the effective clinical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is resistance to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the identification of novel, therapeutically targetable mediators of resistance is vital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental design: We used a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> disease-focused microarray platform to transcriptionally profile chemotherapy-responsive and nonresponsive pretreatment metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> liver biopsies and in vitro samples, both sensitive and resistant to clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs (5-FU and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathway and gene set enrichment analyses identified candidate genes within key pathways mediating drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional RNAi screening identified regulators of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase signaling, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, cell cycle, insulin signaling, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were identified as key pathways involved in mediating drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The G-protein-coupled receptor galanin receptor 1 (GalR1) was identified as a novel regulator of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, silencing either GalR1 or its ligand galanin induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in drug-sensitive and resistant cell lines and synergistically enhanced the effects of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, GalR1/galanin silencing resulted in downregulation of the endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP(L), resulting in induction of caspase-8-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Galanin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found to be overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, and importantly, high galanin expression correlated with poor disease-free survival of patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows the power of systems biology approaches to identify key pathways and genes that are functionally involved in mediating chemotherapy resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have identified a novel role for the GalR1/galanin receptor-ligand axis in chemoresistance, providing evidence to support its further evaluation as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
