<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elderly and frail patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, although often treated with chemotherapy, are under-represented in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed FOCUS2 to investigate reduced-dose chemotherapy options and to seek objective predictors of outcome in frail patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook an open, 2 × 2 factorial trial in 61 UK centres for patients with previously untreated advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were considered unfit for full-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After comprehensive health assessment (CHA), patients were randomly assigned by minimisation to: 48-h intravenous fluorouracil with levofolinate (group A); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and fluorouracil (group B); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (group C); or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment allocation was not masked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting doses were 80% of standard doses, with discretionary escalation to full dose after 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two primary outcome measures were: addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> ([A vs B] + [C vs D]), assessed with progression-free survival (PFS); and substitution of fluorouracil with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> ([A vs C] + [B vs D]), assessed by change from baseline to 12 weeks in global quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical and CHA data were modelled against outcomes with a novel composite measure, overall treatment utility (OTU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is registered, number ISRCTN21221452 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 459 patients were randomly assigned (115 to each of groups A-C, 114 to group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factorial comparison of addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> versus no addition suggested some improvement in PFS, but the finding was not significant (median 5·8 months [IQR 3·3-7·5] vs 4·5 months [2·8-6·4]; hazard ratio 0·84, 95% CI 0·69-1·01, p=0·07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Replacement of fluorouracil with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> did not improve global QoL: 69 of 124 (56%) patients receiving fluorouracil reported improvement in global QoL compared with 69 of 123 (56%) receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of having any grade 3 or worse toxic effect was not significantly increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (83/219 [38%] vs 70/221 [32%]; p=0·17), but was higher with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> than with fluorouracil (88/222 [40%] vs 65/218 [30%]; p=0·03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, fewer baseline symptoms (odds ratio 1·32, 95% CI 1·14-1·52), less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">widespread disease</z:e> (1·51, 1·05-2·19), and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (0·57, 0·39-0·82) were predictive of better OTU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: FOCUS2 shows that with an appropriate design, including reduced starting doses of chemotherapy, frail and elderly patients can participate in a randomised controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On balance, a combination including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was preferable to single-agent fluoropyrimidines, although the primary endpoint of PFS was not met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> did not improve QoL compared with fluorouracil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive baseline assessment holds promise as an objective predictor of treatment benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>FUNDING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research UK and the Medical Research Council </plain></SENT>
