<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To detect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells (CTCs) surface antigens, we present an assay incorporating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50834">cadmium selenide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50853">quantum dots</z:chebi> (QDs) in these paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The principle of the assay is the immunomagnetic separation of CTCs from body fluids in conjunction with QDs, using specific antibody biomarkers: epithelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule antibody, and monoclonal cytokeratin 19 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The detection signal was acquired from the fluorescence signal of QDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the evaluation of the performance, the method under study was used to isolate the human <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line (DLD-1) and CTCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients' peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minimum detection limit of the assay was defined to 10 DLD-1 CRC cells/mL as fluorescence was measured with a spectrofluorometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and Real Time RT-PCR, they both have also been used to evaluate the performance of the described method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we developed a simple, sensitive, efficient and of lower cost (than the existing ones) method for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> CTCs in human samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have accomplished these results by using magnetic bead isolation and subsequent QD fluorescence detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The method described here can be easily adjusted for any other protein target of either the CTC or the host </plain></SENT>
