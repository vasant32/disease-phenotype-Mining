<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Bisphosphonates are used for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153690" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone metastases</z:e> and have been associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent case-control study showed an inverse association between bisphosphonate use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from prospective cohorts are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively examined the relationship between bisphosphonate use and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among 86,277 women enrolled onto the Nurses Health Study (NHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since 1998, participants have returned biennial questionnaires in which they were specifically queried about the regular use of bisphosphonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Through 2008, we documented 801 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> over 814,406 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted HR for women who regularly used bisphosphonates was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.14) and was further attenuated after adjustment for other risk factors (multivariate HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk was not influenced by duration of use (P(trend) = 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonusers, the multivariate-adjusted HRs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 1.24 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.64) for women with 1 to 2 years of use, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.69) for 3 to 4 years of use, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.56) for â‰¥ 5 years of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no association between bisphosphonate use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within strata of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a large prospective cohort, we did not observe an association between long-term use of bisphosphonates and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
