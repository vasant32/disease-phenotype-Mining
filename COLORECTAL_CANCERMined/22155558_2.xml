<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether the recent severe economic recession was associated with diminished screening colonoscopy rates among an insured population and to assess the relationship between out-of-pocket (OOP) costs and screening colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Administrative data from 106 health plans (IMS LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database) were analyzed to determine monthly rates of screening colonoscopies performed on beneficiaries ages 50 to 64 years between January 2005 and November 2007 (prerecession), as well as from December 2007 through June 2009 (recession) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Segmented regression models were used to evaluate changes in screening colonoscopy rates, as well as the relationship between screening and OOP costs before and during the recession </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with prerecession trends, during the recession screening colonoscopy rates decreased by 68.9 colonoscopies/1 million individuals per month (95% confidence interval, -84.6 to -53.1; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of study estimates to the entire US population indicated that during the recession, commercially insured patients aged 50 to 64 years underwent approximately 500,000 fewer screening colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with those with low OOP costs, those with high OOP procedure costs had lower rates of screening before and during the recession, and had a greater reduction in screening rates during the recession (P = .035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During the recession of December 2007 to June 2009, insured individuals reduced their use of screening colonoscopy compared with the 2 years before the recession began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OOP costs were related inversely to screening use, especially during the recession </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Policies to reduce cost sharing could increase adherence to recommended preventive services such as colonoscopy examinations </plain></SENT>
