<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Risk perceptions are legitimate targets for behavioral interventions because they can motivate medical decisions and health behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some survey respondents may not know (or may not indicate) their risk perceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scope of "don't know" (DK) responding is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Examine the prevalence and correlates of responding DK to items assessing perceived risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two nationally representative, population-based, cross-sectional surveys (2005 National Health Interview Survey [NHIS]; 2005 Health Information National Trends Survey [HINTS]), and one primary care clinic-based survey comprised of individuals from low-income communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses included 31,202 (NHIS), 1,937 (HINTS), and 769 (clinic) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Five items assessed perceived risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the items differed in format and/or response scale: comparative risk (NHIS, HINTS); absolute risk (HINTS, clinic), and "likelihood" and "chance" response scales (clinic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the clinic-based survey included an explicit DK response option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: "Don't know" responding was 6.9% (NHIS), 7.5% (HINTS-comparative), and 8.7% (HINTS-absolute). "Don't know" responding was 49.1% and 69.3% for the "chance" and "likely" response options (clinic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlates of DK responding were characteristics generally associated with disparities (e.g., low education), but the pattern of results varied among samples, question formats, and response scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Limitations: The surveys were developed independently and employed different methodologies and items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the results were not directly comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There may be multiple explanations for differences in the magnitude and characteristics of DK responding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: "Don't know" responding is more prevalent in populations affected by health disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Either not assessing or not analyzing DK responses could further disenfranchise these populations and negatively affect the validity of research and the efficacy of interventions seeking to eliminate health disparities </plain></SENT>
