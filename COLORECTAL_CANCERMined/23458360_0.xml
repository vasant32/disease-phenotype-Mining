<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine if pre-operative chemotherapy influences the regenerated liver volume after a major liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 74 patients subjected to a major liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they had been treated with chemotherapy less than 3 months before surgery or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liver volumes were measured before and 1 year after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-operative chemotherapy reduced volumetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> (83 ± 2% versus 91 ± 2%; P = 0.007) as compared with patients without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a linear correlation between regenerated volume and time interval between the end of chemotherapy to resection (P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative chemotherapy in patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> negatively affects volume regeneration after a partial hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time interval between chemotherapy and surgery determines the impact of these affects </plain></SENT>
