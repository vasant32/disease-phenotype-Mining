<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether the positivity rate and the positive predictive values (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi>) for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> decrease with repeated testing by using fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from 2 rounds of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first round, average-risk persons (50 to 74 years old) were randomly assigned to groups that received the guaiac FOBT or FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second round, the subjects received only FIT (1594 received FIT after guaiac FOBT and 2022 received FIT after FIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positivity rate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were compared between second-round participants with a previous negative test result (FIT after guaiac FOBT or FIT after FIT) and first-round participants (guaiac FOBT or FIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of positive results from FIT was 7.4% in the FIT-after-FIT group, compared with 8.1% in the first-round FIT group (P = .34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease was observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> between the first and second round from 55% (132/239) to 44% (112/252; P = .017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 8% (20/239) in the first round versus 4% (9/252) in the second round (P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> detected in the first and second round or the interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of positive results from FIT does not decrease after repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> of FIT for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are significantly lower among second-round participants who tested negative in the first round </plain></SENT>
