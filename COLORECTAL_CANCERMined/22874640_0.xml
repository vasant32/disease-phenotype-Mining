<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> is a phenomenon that alters 3'-untranslated region length leading to altered posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changing <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> patterns have been shown to result in misregulation of genes involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>; therefore, we hypothesized that altered <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> contributes to progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and that measurement of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> may lead to discovery of novel biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used next-generation sequencing to directly measure global patterns of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> changes during colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> progression in 15 human patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were validated in a larger cohort of 50 patients, including 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> pairs from individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We discovered numerous genes presenting progressive changes in <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genes undergoing untranslated region (3'UTR) shortening were enriched for functional groups such as cell-cycle and nucleic acid-binding and processing factors, and those undergoing 3'UTR lengthening or alternative 3'UTR usage were enriched for categories such as cell-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found indications that <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> changes result from differential processing of transcripts because of increased expression of cleavage and polyadenylation factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR analysis in a larger series of human patient samples, including matched pairs, confirmed <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> changes in DMKN, PDXK, and PPIE genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genes undergoing altered <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> during human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> may be useful novel biomarkers and potentially targeted for disease prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that the strategy presented here may be broadly useful in discovery of novel biomarkers for other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and human disease </plain></SENT>
