<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date, there is no screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in Flanders, Belgium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, The European Code Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (2003) recommends a population-based approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to obtain information about potential participation rates for a population-based screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Flanders, and to compare two invitation strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2009, a trial programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was set up in three Flemish areas for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> average-risk people aged 50-74 years, using an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) with a cut-off value set at 75 ng/ml of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The faecal sampling set was sent at random by post (mail group) or provided by the general practitioner (GP group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 19,542 people were invited to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8229 provided a faecal sample, resulting in an overall participation rate of 42.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participation by mail and through the GP was 52.3% (95% CI, 51.3-53.2) and 27.7% (95% CI, 26.7-28.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference of 24.6% was statistically significant (95% CI, 23.3-25.9, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Before the reminder letter was sent and the other invitation strategy was offered, the overall participation rate was 26.5% (n=5176); 36.4% (95% CI, 35.5-37.4) for the mail group and 16.6% (95% CI, 15.8-17.3) for the GP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds of participating in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was almost three times higher for people invited by mail as opposed to people invited through a GP (OR=2.96, 95% CI, 2.78-3.14, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women were more likely to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening than men (OR=1.22, 95% CI, 1.15-1.30, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that inhabitants from residential (OR=1.98, 95% CI, 1.85-2.11) and rural (OR=2.90, 95% CI, 2.66-3.16) areas were more likely to participate than those in urban areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 8229 people who submitted a faecal sample, 435 (5.3%) had a positive iFOBT, and of those, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed in 18 (5.7%) individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compliance for follow-up colonoscopy was 72.9%, and did not differ between the mail (72.4%, 95% CI, 67.5-77.3) and GP groups (74.3, 95% CI, 66.2-82.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inviting people for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening by means of a direct-mail invitation, and including a faecal sampling set (iFOBT), results in much higher participation rates than inviting people through the GP </plain></SENT>
