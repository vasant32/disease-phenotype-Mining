<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coupled with low literacy rates, the burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> morbidity and mortality is exacerbated in this population, making it important to develop culturally and literacy appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> to help low-literacy African Americans make informed decisions about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method was used to mathematically model key messages for the decision aid, which were then used to modify an existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tutorial with different messages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The final tutorial was delivered through computer touch-screen technology to increase access and ease of use for participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Testing showed users were not only more comfortable with the touch-screen technology but were also significantly more willing to have a colonoscopy compared with a "usual care group." Results confirm the importance of including participants in planning and that the use of these innovative mapping and message design methods can lead to significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening attitude change </plain></SENT>
