<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the affect of Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> Rac1b (Si-Rac1b) on the malignant biological behaviors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell including the proliferation, migration, invasion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mediated by lipofectamine 2000, Si-Rac1b was transfected into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line SW1116 (with overexpression of Rac1b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of Rac1b was detected by Western blotting and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CCK-8 assay was used to analyze the cell proliferation, the Wound-healing assay and invasion assay were respectively applied to analyze the cell migration and invasion, and the Hoechst 33258 was used to evaluate the apoptotic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Si-Rac1b can knock down the Rac1b but not Rac1 both in the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, Si-Rac1b could singnificantly facilitate the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and control the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Si-Rac1b could partically reverse the malignant phenotypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell </plain></SENT>
