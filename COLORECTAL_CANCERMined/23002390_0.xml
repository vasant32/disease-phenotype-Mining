<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> represent a unique treatment challenge for medical oncologists because they contain a very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a wide range of recurrence risks after resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Defining these differences in biology can help to explain differences in behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, gene signatures have been developed to define various prognostic groups beyond the clinicopathologic features alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> as a group has not shown survival advantage in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future research to develop gene signatures to predict a group that will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy will be helpful in the clinical decision-making process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to present the prognostic gene signatures currently available for use, those in development, and their utility in stratifying recurrence risk in stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
