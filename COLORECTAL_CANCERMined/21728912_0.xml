<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the health care costs of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) who received second-line treatment with Avastin (bevacizumab) versus Erbitux (cetuximab), from the third-party payer's perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with mCRC were selected from the PharMetrics claims database if they received second-line therapy containing either bevacizumab (second-line bevacizumab cohort) or cetuximab (second-line cetuximab cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six-month costs following second-line therapy start date and average monthly healthcare costs while on second-line therapy (in 2009 US$) were calculated and compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2188 patients with mCRC who met the eligibility criteria were included in the analysis, including 1808 patients receiving bevacizumab and 380 patients receiving cetuximab in second-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' mean age was 61 years and 56% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In second-line treatment, bevacizumab was commonly used with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (43.5%) and irinotecan-based regimens (40.4%), whereas cetuximab was commonly used with irinotecan-based regimens (68.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab patients had significantly lower total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause healthcare costs than cetuximab patients (adjusted difference: -$10,231, p = 0.020), and lower medical costs (-$10,796, p = 0.012) during the 6 months following second-line therapy initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the difference in total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause healthcare costs was attributable to the lower chemotherapy and targeted therapy costs (-$5635, p = 0.032) of bevacizumab patients than those of cetuximab patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While on second-line therapy, bevacizumab patients also had lower average monthly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause healthcare costs than cetuximab patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Second-line treatment in the current study was defined based on changes in mCRC medications, not based on disease progression due to the limited clinical information available in claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of bevacizumab in second-line therapy was associated with significantly lower healthcare costs in mCRC patients, compared to the use of cetuximab </plain></SENT>
