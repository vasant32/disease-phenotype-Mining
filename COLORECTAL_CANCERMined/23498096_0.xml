<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the effects of two clinic-based interventions on patient-provider discussions about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Two-group RCT with data collected at baseline and 1 week post-intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: African-American patients that were non-adherent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations (n=693) with a primary care visit between 2008 and 2010 in one of 11 urban primary care clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Participants received either a computer-delivered tailored <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening intervention or a nontailored informational brochure about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening immediately prior to their primary care visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Between-group differences in odds of having had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussion about a colon test, with and without adjusting for demographic, clinic, health literacy, health belief, and social support variables, were examined as predictors of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussion using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intervention effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test order by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> were examined using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses were conducted in 2011 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to the brochure group, greater proportions of those in the computer-delivered tailored intervention group reported having had a discussion with their provider about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (63% vs 48%, OR=1.81, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Predictors of a discussion about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening included computer group participation, younger age, reason for visit, being unmarried, colonoscopy self-efficacy, and family member/friend recommendation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p-values &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The computer-delivered tailored intervention was more effective than a nontailored brochure at stimulating patient-provider discussions about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those who received the computer-delivered intervention also were more likely to have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test (fecal occult blood test or colonoscopy) ordered by their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> </plain></SENT>
