<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Environmental factors such as diet are known to be involved in the etiology of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several epidemiological studies have suggested that specific neo-formed mutagenic compounds related to meat consumption are an underlying factor involved in the association between diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the genotoxicity of the model <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> (B(a)P) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> 2-amino-1-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16227">pyridine</z:chebi> (PhIP), alone or in mixture, using the mouse intestinal cell line Apc(Min/+), mimicking the early step of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, and control Apc(+/+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotoxicity of B(a)P and PhIP was investigated using both cell lines, through the quantification of B(a)P and PhIP derived DNA adducts, as well as the use of a genotoxic assay based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2AX phosphorylation quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that heterozygous Apc mutated cells are more effective to metabolize B(a)P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also established in different experiments that PhIP and B(a)P were more genotoxic on Apc (Min/+) cells compared to Apc (+/+)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover when tested in mixture, we observed a combined genotoxicity of B(a)P and PhIP on the two cell lines, with an increase of PhIP derived DNA adducts in the presence of B(a)P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of their genotoxic effects observed on heterozygous Apc mutated cells and their possible combined genotoxic effects, both B(a)P and PhIP, taken together, could be implicated in the observed association between meat consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
