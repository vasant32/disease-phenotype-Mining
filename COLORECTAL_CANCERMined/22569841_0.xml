<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As part of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> long-term survivor study (LTS-01), long-term neurotoxicity was assessed in 353 patients on NSABP Protocol C-07 (cross-sectional sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two of these patients from LTS-01 also had longitudinal data and were reassessed 5 to 8 years (median, 7 years) after random assignment (longitudinal sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contingency tables compared cohorts, a mixed model compared neurotoxicity between treatments over time, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test compared neurotoxicity between treatments (cross-sectional sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the cross-sectional sample, the increase in mean total neurotoxicity scores of 1.8 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was statistically significant (P = .005), but not clinically significant (a minimally important difference of 4 was reported at the long-term assessment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> had increased odds of numbness and tingling in hands (odds ratio, 2.00; P = .015) and feet (odds ratio, 2.78; P &lt; .001) versus patients who did not receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> effect varied with time (P &lt; .001) in the longitudinal sample, such that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated group did not have significantly greater total neurotoxicity scores by 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At the long-term endpoint, there was no clinically significant increase in total neurotoxicity scores for patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, but the specific neurotoxicities of numbness and tingling of the hands and feet remained significantly elevated for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated patients </plain></SENT>
