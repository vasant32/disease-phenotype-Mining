<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a large population-based comparison of such associations in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) and Ontario (ON) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case control study design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> cases were new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients aged 20-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were a sex and age-group matched random sample of the population in each province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1760 cases and 2481 controls from NL and ON were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information on dietary intake and lifestyle was collected using self-administered food frequency and personal history questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Controls reported higher mean daily intakes of total calcium and total <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> than cases in both provinces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ON, significant reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was associated with intakes of total calcium (OR of highest vs. lowest quintiles was 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.77, p(trend) = 0.03), total <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> (OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-1.00), dietary calcium (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.97), dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.99), total dairy products and milk (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.60-1.00), calcium-containing supplements use (OR = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In NL, the inverse associations of calcium, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were most pronounced among calcium- or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>-containing supplement users (OR = 0.67, 0.68, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study add to the evidence that total calcium, dietary calcium, total <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, calcium- or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>-containing supplement use may reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The inverse associations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk with intakes of total dairy products and milk may be largely due to calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
