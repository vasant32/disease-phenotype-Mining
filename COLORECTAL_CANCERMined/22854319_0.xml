<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we cultivated spheres from the SW620 cell line in serum-free medium and evaluated the features of the spheres by immunofluorescence, cell cycle distribution, resistance to chemotherapeutics and soft agar clone formation, and the spheres were shown to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem-like cells through tumorigenicity in athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of pluripotency genes, such as Sox-2, Oct-4 and Bmi-1, showed that the spheres were generated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> of SW620 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study explored the use of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in spheres, which were treated with two n-3 PUFAs [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the spheres with DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> alone or in combination for 72 h led to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the progressive loss of viability and DNA fragmentation and an increase in annexin V expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHA and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> can enhance the chemotherapeutic sensitivity effect of 5-Fu and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi>, especially DHA combined with <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results provide evidence that n-3 PUFAs exert a direct anticancer action that may contribute to their antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem-like cells </plain></SENT>
