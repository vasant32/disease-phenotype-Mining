<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have suggested the involvement of gut microbiota in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We utilized pyrosequencing based analysis of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA genes to determine the overall structure of microbiota in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and healthy controls; we investigated microbiota of the intestinal lumen, the cancerous tissue and matched noncancerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we investigated the mucosa-adherent microbial composition using rectal swab samples because the structure of the tissue-adherent <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> community is potentially altered following bowel cleansing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that the microbial structure of the intestinal lumen and cancerous tissue differed significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phylotypes that enhance energy harvest from diets or perform metabolic exchange with the host were more abundant in the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were more abundant Firmicutes and less abundant Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall microbial structures of cancerous tissue and noncancerous tissue were similar; however the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microbiota exhibited lower diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structures of the intestinal lumen microbiota and mucosa-adherent microbiota were different in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients compared to matched microbiota in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lactobacillales was enriched in cancerous tissue, whereas Faecalibacterium was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the mucosa-adherent microbiota, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia were reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, whereas Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus, and Mogibacterium were enriched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the lumen, predominant phylotypes related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> or metabolic exchange with the host, Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Coriobacteriaceae were increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Coupled with previous reports, these results suggest that the intestinal microbiota is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and that intestinal lumen microflora potentially influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk via cometabolism or metabolic exchange with the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, mucosa-associated microbiota potentially affects <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk primarily through direct interaction with the host </plain></SENT>
