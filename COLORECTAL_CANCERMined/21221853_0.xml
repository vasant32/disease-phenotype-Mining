<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis was planned to quantify the benefit and assess safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selected for the analysis were randomized clinical studies that have used panitumumab-based therapy (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>) for patients with mCRC and where the outcome of patients with WT KRAS was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four eligible studies were analyzed including 1,010 and 1,105 patients who received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> and the control intervention, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Used in subsequent-line setting, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> was associated with 42% improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36-0.93; P = 0.02), a non-significant overall survival (OS) benefit (HR = 0.90; [95% CI, 0.76-1.05]; P = 0.18), and a significant increase in objective response rate (ORR) (odds ratio (OR) = 0.67 [95% CI, 1.15-77.98]; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> showed no benefit in the first-line setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restricted analysis to two studies (first- and second-line setting), where the treatment effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> was prospectively analyzed according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> KRAS status, showed significant PFS (HR = 0.77), OS (HR = 0.84), and ORR (OR = 2.06) advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients' subgroups attained clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi>-related adverse events were similar across comparisons with the exception of toxicities known to be associated with anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis showed significant clinical benefit for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53322">PBT</z:chebi> for patients with WT KRAS mCRC predominantly when used following prior chemotherapy exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The benefit was demonstrated in most subgroup analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research to better define potential responders is needed </plain></SENT>
