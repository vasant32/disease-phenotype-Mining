<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: ABCB1/MDR1 protein is found in high concentrations on the apical surfaces of colonic epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It acts as an efflux pump by transporting toxic endogenous substances, drugs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> out of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the ABCB1/MDR1 gene may either change expression of the ABCB1/MDR1 protein or alter its function, suggesting its possible association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported a relationship between ABCB1 gene polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, but no consistent conclusion has been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to identify any association between the ABCB1 gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cbmdisc and CNKI were searched for studies on the relationship of ABCB1/MDR1 gene SNPs and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eligible articles were included for data extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the frequency of ABCB1/MDR1 gene SNPs among cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the distribution of SNPs was performed mainly using Review Manager 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten, four and two trials were identified that focussed on the ABCB1 gene SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs3789243, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 3175 cases and 3715 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis, stratified by ethnicity or population source, indicated no association between the ABCB1 gene rs1045642 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, when the study by Bae et al. was removed from the analysis, there was some evidence to indicate a higher T-allele frequency in Asian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02-1.67, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neither ABCB1 rs2032582 nor ABCB1 rs3789243 indicated an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An increased frequency only of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> combined allele (rs2032582G/rs1045642C) was found in Caucasian patients (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.44, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is some evidence to indicate an association between ABCB1 rs1045642T and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Compared with the ABCB1 gene SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 or rs3789243 alone, combined haplotypes of several SNPs might be a better marker to determine the genetic influence on the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
