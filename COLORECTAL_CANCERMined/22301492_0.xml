<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mismatch repair (MMR) status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is being increasingly recognized as a prognostic, predictive, and possible germline predisposition/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (LS) biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current methods (clinical history and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>) to predict MMR deficiency (dMMR) are suboptimal, and implementation of reflex laboratory testing of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> has been recommended, a strategy requiring test standardization and clinical coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two web-based questionnaires were administered, a general and a specialist laboratory questionnaire, to establish the availability of such tests, requisite clinical/pathology integration, current mode of test initiation, reporting and recommendation practices, and education and attitudes among pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical aspects were reviewed on the basis of specialist laboratory practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 76 respondents, 21.5% were unaware or were uncertain whether they had access to MMR immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although 78.9% of respondents had access to such testing, an integrated approach to the identification of patients with LS is lacking, being limited to just 9 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority (70%) of testing is clinician initiated, with variable implementation of reflex testing and divergent practices in recommendation to test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standardized reporting is lacking in many centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Education on MMR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> is poor compared with that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: This multicenter questionnaire highlights heterogenous practices in dMMR testing and LS identification, both in clinical terms and with regard to technical aspects of testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An integrated multidisciplinary approach is lacking, and there is a need to educate physicians and resolve ethical issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A Canadian consensus statement and national guidelines on dMMR testing are urgently needed, requiring input from pathologists, clinicians, and genetic counselors </plain></SENT>
