<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, the analysis of gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> specimens determined that 78-kiloDalton <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, up-regulation serves as an efficient mechanism protecting cells against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and can confer drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether functional polymorphisms within the GRP78 gene are related to clinical outcome in gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples of 234 stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at the University of Southern California (USC) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 137 patients with localized <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (GA) at USC and Memorial Sloan-Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Centers were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GRP78 polymorphisms analyzed on germline DNA were correlated with clinical outcome using univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GA patients with the combined GRP78 rs391957 C/T and T/T genotype were at higher risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> [hazard ratio (HR) 2.61; P &lt; 0.001 and HR 3.17; P &lt; 0.001, respectively], than those with C/C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings were subsequently tested in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cohort where patients with the homozygous T/T genotype were at highest risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence (HR 2.61; P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results remained significant after adjusting for clinicopathologic determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data provide the first evidence that the GRP78 rs391957 polymorphism can predict clinical outcome in localized GA and locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
