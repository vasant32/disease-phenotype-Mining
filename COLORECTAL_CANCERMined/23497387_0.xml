<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Predictor variables were: sociodemographicvariables, optimism; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> threat appraisal; perceived social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Qualityof life was assessed with the Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-Colorectal (HRQOL);and the Satisfaction with Life Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth mixture models were applied to identifytrajectory classes and their predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distinct adjustment trajectories were identified for HR-QOL and life satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loweroptimism, poorer social support, a more negative cognitive appraisal, and younger age wereassociated with poorer life satisfaction, while survivors with less than 8 years of educationhad higher life satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern was similar for overall HR-QOL except thateducational level was not a significant predictor and later stage disease and female genderemerged as related to poorer outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One in five survivors reported poorer constant HRQOL(19.2%) and a small group had poor life satisfaction (7.2%); 26.2% reported constanthigh HR-QOL and 48.8% had high constant life satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic disadvantageand remoteness of residence uniquely predicted poorer outcomes in the colorectal cancerspecific HR-QOL sub domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although HR-QOL and subjective cognitive QOL share similar antecedents their trajectorypatterns suggested they are distinct adjustment outcomes; with life satisfaction emerging astemporally stable phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unique patterns of risk support suggest the need to accountfor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in adjustment in longitudinal QOL studies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
