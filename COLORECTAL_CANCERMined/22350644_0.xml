<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Self-reported taste alterations are common in people receiving chemotherapy; however, it is usually unclear whether these reports refer to changes to the sense of taste itself or to problems related to the broader phenomenon of flavour, or the hedonic experience of eating and drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to explore patient and carer descriptions, experiences and consequences of taste and flavour changes associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study utilised a grounded theory research design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purposeful sampling was used to recruit eligible patients who had self-reported taste changes in relation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Content analysis of interview data was performed using an analysis framework derived from previous sensory and nutritional sciences and supportive care research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients and four carers participated in semi-structured interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overarching theme identified from the data was reduced food enjoyment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to changes to taste, participants described sensory and hedonic changes which influence overall flavour perception and food enjoyment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduced food enjoyment had dietary, social and emotional consequences for patients and carers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 'Taste' problems during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatment mostly relate to the broader phenomena of flavour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study has helped to unravel the major sensory determinants of the eating and drinking experience in the chemotherapy setting and has provided guidance regarding relevant and measurable endpoints of chemotherapy-related flavour changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There remains a gap in knowledge between the pattern of flavour changes associated with chemotherapy treatment and how this influences dietary intake and nutritional status </plain></SENT>
