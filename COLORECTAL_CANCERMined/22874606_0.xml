<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most self-expandable metallic stents for colorectal placement are uncovered because of the high migration rate of covered stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal stent design for colorectal use remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a double-wire woven uncovered stent for definitive palliative treatment of malignant colorectal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study was a prospective, single-arm, observational clinical study of patients enrolled between December 2005 and September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a referral hospital in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with malignant colorectal obstruction were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: A double-wire woven uncovered stent was placed by use of a standard through-the-scope endoscopic placement technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Technical, initial clinical, and long-term clinical success were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term clinical success was defined as sustained relief of obstructive symptoms without reintervention until the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Karnofsky performance status score before stent placement was 60 (median, interquartile range, 42.5-67.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty of 24 patients had primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and 4 had extracolorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The site of obstruction was the ascending colon in 10 patients, descending colon in 4 patients, sigmoid colon in 7 patients, and rectum in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Technical, initial, and long-term clinical success rates were 100%, 100%, and 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median stent patency time was 149 days (interquartile range, 45-198 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median survival time after stent placement was 155 days (interquartile range, 68-231 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four patients (17%) had negative outcomes including stent occlusion by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> ingrowth (8%) and stent migration (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The highest Karnofsky performance status score after stent placement was 70 (median; interquartile range, 50-70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Karnofsky performance status score improved after stent placement (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study was limited because it was a single-arm, single-center study, and it had a small sample size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic placement of double-wire woven uncovered stents is effective and safe as definitive palliative treatment for patients with malignant colorectal obstruction </plain></SENT>
