<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The immune responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on surveillance or active chemotherapy have not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination study to determine the serological immune response rate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the 2006-2007 influenza season, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated at Roswell Park <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute were offered vaccination with the trivalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccine (Fluzone, 2006-2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay titers were collected before and 3 months after vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to vaccination was determined using an endpoint of â‰¥ 1:40 HI titer ratio or a fourfold HI increase at 3 months from vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A response in HI to at least one of the 3 strains was considered an immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immune response in the overall population was 70.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in response were noted between the 58 patients on active chemotherapy and the 27 patients on surveillance [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.78; P = 0.8] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds of response did not vary by chemotherapy regimen or by chemotherapy-vaccination timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HI response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 titers concurrently were low in both the chemotherapy (12.1%) and surveillance groups (11.1%) (OR = 1.10; P = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mount an immune response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination irrespective of their chemotherapy regimen or timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, concurrent responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three strains in the individual patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The investigation of a booster vaccine in this population is warranted </plain></SENT>
