<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is important because the increasing availability of new devices allows us to perform procedures with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001258'>reduced length</z:mp> of surgery and decreased blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein report the results of a literature review of energy sources for laparoscopic colorectal surgery, focused especially on 6 studies comparing ultrasonic coagulating shears (UCS) and other instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also describe our laparoscopic dissection techniques using UCS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcomes of surgeries using UCS and Ligasure for laparoscopic colorectal surgery were superior to conventional electrosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some authors have reported that the length of surgery or blood loss when Ligasure was used for laparoscopic colorectal surgery is less than when UCS was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated that there were no significant differences between the short-term outcomes of UCS and Ligasure for laparoscopic colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is therefore suggested that the choice of technique used should be made according to the surgeon's preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also describe our laparoscopic dissection techniques using UCS (Harmonic ACE) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with regard to the retroperitoneum dissection, dissection technique, dissection technique around the feeding artery, and various other dissection techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore review the outcomes of using various energy sources for laparoscopic colorectal surgery and describe our laparoscopic dissection techniques with UCS (Harmonic ACE) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
