<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimation of this association, a meta-analysis was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate reported studies of the relationship between TGF-β1 gene promoter-509C/T polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk using fixed-effects model and random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk among subjects carrying TGF-β1 gene promoter-509CC+CT genotype (odds ratio (OR)=1.18%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.06-1.32) using 4440/6785 cases/controls in total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed an increased risk of the TGF-β1 gene promoter -509CC, CT and CC+CT polymorphisms for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in population-based study (OR=1.36, 95% CI: 1.19-1.56, OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.34 and OR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.12-1.43, respectively) in stratified analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed an increased colorectal risk among CC and CC+CT carriers in European and American population (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.04-1.43 and OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> among subjects carrying CC+CT genotype (OR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.05-1.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis results suggest that TGF-β1 gene promoter -509C allele variant is a possible risk factor for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recommendations for further studies include pooling of individual data to verify results from the study and to facilitate evaluation of multigenic effects and detailed analysis of effect modification by environmental and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
