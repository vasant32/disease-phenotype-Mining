<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent retrospective study in Western countries raised the possibility that KRAS p.G13D mutation may not be absolutely predictive of non-response compared with other KRAS mutations from the findings of longer overall survival and progression-free survival following cetuximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated the relationship between KRAS status and cetuximab efficacy among Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of 109 patients from nine institutions in Japan were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were refractory or intolerant to fluoropyrimidine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and irinotecan, and they were treated with a cetuximab + irinotecan regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival were compared according to KRAS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 76 (70%), 7 (6%) and 26 (24%) patients had KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, KRAS p.G13D and other KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their various parameters were as follows: response rate: 30% (23/76), 14% (1/7) and 0% (0/26); disease control rate: 71% (54/76), 71% (5/7) and 54% (14/26); median progression-free survival: 4.6 months (95% confidence interval, 2.8-6.3), 4.1 months (0-9.9) and 2.1 months (1.5-2.8); and median overall survival: 11.2 months (6.4-16.0), 8.5 months (5.3-11.8) and 6.8 months (4.1-9.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival or overall survival was observed between KRAS p.G13D-mutant and other mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, the disease control rate was higher in KRAS p.G13D-mutant patients and a partial response was observed in one such patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggested that cetuximab showed some activity inÂ KRAS p.G13D-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is warranted </plain></SENT>
