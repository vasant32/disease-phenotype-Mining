<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sex and ethnicity preferences for endoscopists in a largely Hispanic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were given an anonymous questionnaire in which information on demographics and sex/ethnic preferences for endoscopists was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bivariate and multivariate models were used to assess factors that affected outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 438 patients were included (213 men, 225 women; mean age 62 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predominant ethnicities were white (44%) and Hispanic (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six percent and 17% of patients expressed sex and ethnicity preferences, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women (30.8%), particularly Hispanic women (35%), had a sex preference more often than men (20.4%; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hispanics had an ethnicity preference more often than white patients (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower education level, being a first-generation immigrant, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, having a concurrent preference for obstetrician/gynecologist, and ethnicity preference for endoscopist were associated with the presence of a sex preference for the endoscopist (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Being a first-generation immigrant and having an ethnicity preference for a primary care provider or the sex of the endoscopist were significantly associated with a preference for the ethnicity of the endoscopist (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Results are based on self-report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Limited study factors were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among a predominant Hispanic population, sex and ethnicity preferences for endoscopists are often seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They may coexist, increase the likelihood of the presence of one when the other is present, and likely influence compliance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
