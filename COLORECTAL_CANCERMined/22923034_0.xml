<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: It is relatively unknown how different dietary components, in partnership, regulate gene expression linked to colon pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the combination of various bioactive components present in a plant-based diet is crucial for their potential anticancer activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study employed a combinatorial chemopreventive strategy to investigate the impact of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> and/or isothiocyanates on DNA methylation processes in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To gain insights into the epigenetic-mediated changes in gene expression in response to these dietary constituents cultured Caco-2 and HCT116 cells were exposed for up to 12 days to different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27812">methylselenocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18212">selenite</z:chebi> (ranging from 0.2 to 5 μM) either alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47807">sulforaphane</z:chebi> and iberin (ranging from 6 to 8 μM), and changes to gene-specific (p16 ( INK4A ) and ESR1), global (LINE-1) methylation and DNMT expression were quantified using real-time PCR-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No effects on the methylation of CpG islands in ESR1, p16 ( INK4A ) or of LINE-1, a marker of global genomic methylation, were observed after exposure of Caco-2 and HCT116 cells to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> or isothiocyanates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only transient changes in DNMT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, which occurred mostly in the treatment groups containing isothiocyanates, were observed, and these occurred only for specific DNMT transcripts and did not lead to the modification of the aberrant methylation status present in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> and/or isothiocyanates, either individually or in combination does not impact abnormal methylation patterns of key genes involved in the complex multistep process of colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
