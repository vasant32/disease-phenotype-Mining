<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from 144 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 120 healthy volunteers were adopted in present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weak <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> exchange (WCX) magnetic beads and PBSII-C protein chips reader (Ciphergen Biosystems Ins.) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein fingerprint expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the Serum samples and the resulted profiles between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> groups were analyzed with Biomarker Wizard system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several proteomic peaks were detected and four potential biomarkers with different expression profiles were identified with their relative molecular weights of 2870.7 Da, 3084 Da, 9180.5 Da, and 13748.8 Da, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the four proteins, two proteins with m/z 2870.7 and 3084 were down-regulated, and the other two with m/z 9180.5 and 13748.8 were up-regulated in serum samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present diagnostic model could distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from healthy controls with the sensitivity of 92.85% and the specificity of 91.25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blind test data indicated a sensitivity of 86.95% and a specificity of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The result suggested that MALDI technology could be used to screen critical proteins with differential expression in the serum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differentially regulated proteins were considered as potential biomarkers for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the serum and of the potential value for further investigation </plain></SENT>
