<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The impact of the LND on survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1205 consecutive patients who underwent potentially curative surgery for sigmoid colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> with high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) from January 1997 to February 2008 were assigned to 4 groups based on LND: LND0, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>-615 patients (51.0%); LND1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the pericolic nodes-324 patients (26.9%); LND2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the intermediate nodes-172 patients (14.3%); and LND3, node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> at the origin of the IMA-94 patients (7.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with LND0, LND1, LND2, and LND3 were 83%, 63%, 52%, and 28%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival rates of patients with LND0, LND1, LND2, and LND3 were 83%, 54%, 43%, and 21%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, LND was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the 5-year local recurrence-free survival rate was not inversely related to the LND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On a subset analysis that compared stage III disease with stage IV disease, the 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 45% and 31% for the patients with stage IV disease compared with 40% and 32% for the patients with stage III, LND3 disease, respectively (P = 0.761 and 0.704) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the patients with pN1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the overall survival and disease-free survival did not differ significantly according to the LND (P = 0.471 and 0.347, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, for patients with pN2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the overall survival and disease-free survival curves among the LND groups significantly differed (P &lt; 0.001 and &lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LND is an independent predictor of survival for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, but it does not predict local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The N categorization including LND may enhance the prognostic value of the TNM staging system for patients with node-positive sigmoid colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
