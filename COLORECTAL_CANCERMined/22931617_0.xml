<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of OPRT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected using RT-PCR in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues and paired adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues from 58 patients receiving FOLFOX6 regimen chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The toxicities of the chemotherapy were recorded, and the correlations between OPRT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and the toxicities were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OPRT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues than in the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (P=0.001), but OPRT expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was not correlated with the toxicities of the chemotherapy (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OPRT level in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues showed a significant positive correlation with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in these cases (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: OPRT expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues is not correlated with the toxicities of 5-FU-based regimen, but OPRT expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues can help predict the toxicities associated with 5-FU </plain></SENT>
