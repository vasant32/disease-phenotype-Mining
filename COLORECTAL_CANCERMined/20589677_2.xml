<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed prospective empirical data from a randomized-controlled trial to compare cost-effectiveness of screening with either one round of immunochemical fecal occult blood testing (I-FOBT; OC-Sensor®), one round of guaiac FOBT (G-FOBT; Hemoccult-II®) or no screening in Dutch aged 50 to 75 years, completed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry and literature data, from a third-party payer perspective in a Markov model with first- and second-order Monte Carlo simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Costs were measured in Euros (€), effects in life-years gained, and both were discounted with 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uncertainty surrounding important parameters was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I-FOBT dominated the alternatives: after one round of I-FOBT screening, a hypothetical person would on average gain 0.003 life-years and save the health care system €27 compared with G-FOBT and 0.003 life years and €72 compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, in 4,460,265 Dutch aged 50-75 years, after one round I-FOBT screening, 13,400 life-years and €320 million would have been saved compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>I-FOBT also dominated in sensitivity analyses, varying uncertainty surrounding important effect and cost parameters </plain></SENT>
