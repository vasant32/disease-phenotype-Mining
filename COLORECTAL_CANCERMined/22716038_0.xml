<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined patient reported symptom burden during second-line treatment of mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult mCRC patients treated in the second-line setting with a regimen that included B, C, or chemotherapy only (O) and who had completed ≥ 1 Patient Care Monitor (PCM) surveys as part of routine clinical care were drawn from the ACORN Data Warehouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000958'>dry skin</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e>, nail changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, burning in hands/feet, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear mixed models examined change in PCM scores across B, C and O (B = reference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 182 patients were enrolled (B: n = 106, C: n = 38, O: n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were 51% female, 67% Caucasian, with mean age of 62.0 (SD = 12.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Groups did not differ on demographic or clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common second-line regimens were FOLFIRI ± B or C (23.1%) and FOLFOX ± B or C (22.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results showed baseline scores to be strongly predictive of second-line symptoms across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PCM items (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p's &lt; .0001 except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rash</z:e>, p = .0013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Controlling for baseline, patients on B tended to have more stable and less severe symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients on C had more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000958'>dry skin</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e> and had nail change scores that worsened faster than did B patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving second-line treatment for mCRC with B report less symptom burden, especially dermatologic, compared to patients treated with C </plain></SENT>
