<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As part of the Japanese submission for the adjuvant indication, the safety profile of FOLFOX4 regimen was compared in Asian and Western patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 3359 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with the FOLFOX4 regimen were included in the analyses: 1515 from 2 Asian studies (Japanese Post Marketing Surveillance and Multicenter Asia Study in Adjuvant Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/5-FU/LV), and 1844 from 4 Western studies (EFC2962, N9741, EFC4584, and Multicenter International Study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi>/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doses administered and safety parameters were analyzed by using common definitions and programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between Asian and Western patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received FOLFOX4 for a median of 6-12 cycles, which ranged from 16 to 28 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median dose intensities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, bolus and infusion, were within the ranges of 33 to 36 mg/m(2)/week, 297 to 338 mg/m(2)/week, and 467 to 510 mg/m(2)/week, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most frequently reported adverse events (AE) included hematologic, gastrointestinal, and neurosensory adverse events (NSAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade ≥3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> ranged from 37% (422 of 1134) to 52% (83 of 159) in Asian and 41% (455 of 1108) to 56% (144 of 259) in Western studies; of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, ranged from 1.4% (3 of 222) to 6.3% (10 of 159) and 11% (30 of 268 or 120 of 1108) to 14% (36 of 259); of NSAEs, from 1.9% (21 of 1134) to 4.4% (7 of 159) and 9.3% (25 of 268) to 19% (39 of 209); and of allergic reactions, from 0.6% (7 of 1134) to 3.1% (5 of 159) and 1.1% (3 of 268) to 3.0% (33 of 1108), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of grade ≥3 NSAEs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> was statistically significantly lower in Asian than in Western studies by using a log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that Asian patients experienced worse toxicity than did Western patients when treated with FOLFOX4, and trends toward reduced neurotoxicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> among Asian patients were observed </plain></SENT>
