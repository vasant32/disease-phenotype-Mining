<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine how commercial software platform upgrades impact on derived parameters for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following ethical approval, 30 patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent Perfusion CT using integrated 64 detector PET/CT before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed using software based on modified distributed parameter analysis (Perfusion software version 4; Perfusion 4.0), then repeated using the previous version (Perfusion software version 3; Perfusion 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and permeability surface area product (PS) were determined for identical regions-of-interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slice-by-slice and 'whole <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>' variance was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean BF, BV and PS was 20.4%, 59.5%, and 106% higher, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> 14.3% shorter for Perfusion 4.0 than Perfusion 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean difference (95% limits of agreement) were +13.5 (-44.9 to 72.0), +2.61 (-0.06 to 5.28), -1.23 (-6.83 to 4.36), and +14.2 (-4.43 to 32.8) for BF, BV, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and PS respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within subject coefficient of variation was 36.6%, 38.0%, 27.4% and 60.6% for BF, BV, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and PS respectively indicating moderate to poor agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Software version upgrades of the same software platform may result in significantly different parameter values, requiring adjustments for cross-version comparison </plain></SENT>
