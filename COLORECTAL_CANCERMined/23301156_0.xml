<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of acid ceramidase (AC) - a cysteine amidase that hydrolyses the proapoptotic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> - is abnormally high in several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, which is suggestive of a role in chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Available AC inhibitors lack, however, the potency and drug-likeness necessary to test this idea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic drug</z:chebi> carmofur, which is used in the clinic to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, is a potent AC inhibitor and that this property is essential to its anti-proliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modifications in the chemical scaffold of carmofur yield new AC inhibitors that act synergistically with standard antitumoral drugs to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings identify AC as an unexpected target for carmofur, and suggest that this molecule can be used as starting point for the design of novel chemosensitizing agents </plain></SENT>
