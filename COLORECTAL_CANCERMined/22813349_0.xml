<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) care has improved considerably, particularly since the implementation of a quality of care program centered on national evidence-based guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Formal quality assessment is however still needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this research was to identify factors associated with practice variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients identified from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers in South-West France were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated variations in practices (from diagnosis to surgery), and compliance with recommended guidelines for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified factors associated with three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> practice variations potentially linked to better survival: examination of ≥ 12 lymph nodes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>), non-use and use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II and stage III patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 1,206 patients, 825 (68%) with colon and 381 (32%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, from 53 hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compliance was high for resection, pathology report, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> examination, and chemotherapy use for stage III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, 26% of stage II patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and 71% of stage III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>84% of stage US T3T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients received pre-operative radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, factors associated with examination of ≥ 12 LNs were: lower ECOG score, advanced stage and larger hospital volume; factors negatively associated were: left sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location and one hospital district </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Use of chemotherapy in stage II patients was associated with younger age, advanced stage, emergency setting and care structure (private and location); whereas under-use in stage III patients was associated with advanced age, presence of comorbidities and private hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although some changes in practices may have occurred since this observational study, these findings represent the most recent report on practices in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in this region, and offer a useful methodological approach for assessing quality of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Guideline compliance was high, although some organizational factors such as hospital size or location influence practice variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These factors should be the focus of any future guideline implementation </plain></SENT>
