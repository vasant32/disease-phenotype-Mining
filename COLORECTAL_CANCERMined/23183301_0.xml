<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> can present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> in 7%-30% of cases, especially if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is located at or distal to the splenic flexure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these cases, emergency surgical decompression becomes mandatory as the traditional treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It involves defunctioning stoma with or without primary resection of obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An alternative to surgery is endoluminal decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of colonic stents, used as a bridge to surgery, in the management of malignant left colonic and rectal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We considered only randomized trials which compared stent vs surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> from left sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (as a bridge to surgery) irrespective of their size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No language or publication status restrictions were imposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Science Citation Index (from inception to December 2011) RESULTS: We identified 3109 citations through our electronic search and 3 through other sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial screening of the titles and abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 3104 citations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A further 5 citations were excluded after detailed screening of full articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three published studies were included in this systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 197 patients were included in our analysis, 97 of them had colorectal stent vs 100 who had emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical success has been defined in different manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In included trials the clinical success rate was significantly higher in the emergency surgery group (99%) compared with the stent group (52.5%) (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the overall complication rate in the stent group (48.5%) vs emergency surgery group (51%) (p = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in 30-days postoperative mortality (p = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was analyzed in none trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When used as a bridge to surgery, colorectal stents provide some advantages: the primary anastomosis rate was significantly higher in the stent group (64.9%) vs emergency surgery group (55%) (p = 0.003); the overall stoma rate was significantly lower in the stent group (45.3%) compared with the emergency surgery group (62%) (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two groups as to permanent stoma rate (46.7% in stent group vs 51.8% in surgical group, p = 0.56), anastomotic leakage rate (9% in stent group vs 3.7% in surgical group, p = 0.35) and intra-abdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> rate (5.1% in stent group vs 4.9% in surgical group, p = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although colonic stenting appears to be an effective treatment of malignant large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e>, the clinical success resulted significantly higher in the emergency surgery group without any advantages in terms of overall complication rate and 30-days postoperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery provides surgical advantages, as higher primary anastomosis rate and a lower overall stoma rate, without increasing the risk of anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, these results should be interpreted with caution because few studies reported data on these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Due to the small and variable sample size of the included trials, further RCTs are needed including a larger number of patients and evaluating long term results (overall survival and quality of life) and cost-effectiveness analysis </plain></SENT>
