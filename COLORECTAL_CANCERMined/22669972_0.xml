<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fas is a member of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of Fas leads to induction of apoptotic signals, such as caspase 8 activation, as well as "non-apoptotic" cellular responses, notably NF-κB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Convincing experimental data have identified NF-κB as a critical promoter of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development, creating a solid rationale for the development of antitumor therapy that suppresses NF-κB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, compelling data have also shown that NF-κB activity enhances <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although stimulation of Fas activates NF-κB, the function of NF-κB in the Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway remains largely undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed that deficiency of either Fas or FasL resulted in significantly increased incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34342">3-methylcholanthrene</z:chebi>-induced spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> development in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Fas-deficient mice also exhibited significantly greater incidence of azoxymethane and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi>-induced colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with high Fas protein in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells had a longer time before recurrence occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Engagement of Fas with FasL triggered NF-κB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, canonical NF-κB was found to directly bind to the FAS promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blocking canonical NF-κB activation diminished Fas expression, whereas blocking alternate NF-κB increased Fas expression in human <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, although canonical NF-κB protected mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells from TNFα-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, knocking out p65 diminished Fas expression in MEF cells, resulting in inhibition of FasL-induced caspase 8 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, knocking out p52 increased Fas expression in MEF cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that canonical NF-κB is a Fas transcription activator and alternate NF-κB is a Fas transcription repressor, and Fas functions as a suppressor of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> and colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
