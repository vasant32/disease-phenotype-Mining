<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the relationship between polymorphisms present in the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR) gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, a systematic meta-analysis of population-based studies was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 38 relevant reports published between January 1990 and August 2010 were identified, of which only 23 qualified for this meta-analysis based on our selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five polymorphic variants of the VDR gene, including Cdx-2 (intron 1e) and FokI (exon 2) present in the 5' region of the gene, and BsmI (intron 8), ApaI (intron 8), and TaqI (exon 9) sites present in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), were evaluated for possible associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Review manager 4.2 was used to perform statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the meta-analysis performed, only the BsmI polymorphism was found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the BsmI B genotype was found to be related to an overall decrease in the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> [BB vs bb: odds ratio (OR) = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.94, P = 3 × 10(-4); BB vs Bb + bb: OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.97, P = 5 × 10(-4)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in subgroup analyses, the BsmI B genotype was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An absence of between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A meta-analysis of 23 published studies identified the BsmI polymorphism of the VDR gene to be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
