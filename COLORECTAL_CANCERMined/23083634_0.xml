<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was performed in 94 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated in the second line with cetuximab and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was correlated with decreased median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the potential role of STAT3 as a molecular target to optimize anti-EGFR therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is involved in epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in a KRAS-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) expression in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated with anti-EGFR-containing salvage chemotherapy has never been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: : The first endpoint of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of pSTAT3 on the time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) in 94 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR-based therapies in the second- or third-line setting between July 2004 and November 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The influence of pSTAT3 on objective response rate and overall survival (OS) was also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nuclear expression of pSTAT3 status was evaluated by immunohistochemical tests on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples obtained before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive expression of pSTAT3 was observed in 24.5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The probability of achieving an objective response was 13% among patients with positive nuclear expression of pSTAT3 compared with 41% for patients displaying pSTAT3-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression model, high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS status, and negative pSTAT3 status significantly improved <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results underscore an impact of pSTAT3 on the clinical efficacy of anti-EGFR-containing chemotherapy regimens and support the prospective assessment of this biomarker </plain></SENT>
