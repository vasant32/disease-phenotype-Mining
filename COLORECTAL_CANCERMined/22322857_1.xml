<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a novel interaction between FLIP and the DNA repair protein Ku70 that regulates FLIP protein stability by inhibiting its polyubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA) enhances the acetylation of Ku70, thereby disrupting the FLIP/Ku70 complex and triggering FLIP polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro and in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> models, we further demonstrated that SAHA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is dependant on FLIP downregulation and caspase 8 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor Tubacin recapitulated the effects of SAHA, suggesting that HDAC6 is a key regulator of Ku70 acetylation and FLIP protein stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, HDAC inhibitors with anti-HDAC6 activity act as efficient post-transcriptional suppressors of FLIP expression and may, therefore, effectively act as 'FLIP inhibitors' </plain></SENT>
