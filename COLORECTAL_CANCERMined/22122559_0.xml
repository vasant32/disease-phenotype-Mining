<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggested that the immunological faecal occult blood test illustrated a variation in positivity according to season and ambient temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the effect of season and ambient temperature on the positivity rates of the gFOBT during pilot screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data from the first year of round 1 of the pilot screening programme in Coventry and Warwickshire were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive and negative gFOBT samples were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with spoilt samples or incomplete data were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the total of 59513 patients, 30311 were men and 29202 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daily temperature data were provided by the meteorological office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median exposure of the gFOBT test card was 6 days (range 1-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median daily maximum temperature was 14°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spring and summer illustrated significantly decreased positivity rates compared with autumn and winter (Pearson's chi-squared test, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean daily maximum temperature for the test card exposure showed no significant difference in positivity rates (P=0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction in positive samples in the &gt;25°C subgroup (P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a seasonal variation in positivity rates of gFOBTs with increased positivity in spring and summer months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is no difference in positivity rates in relation to ambient temperature except in subgroup analysis where there is a significant reduction in positivity rates above 25°C </plain></SENT>
