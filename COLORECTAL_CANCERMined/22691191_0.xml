<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Compared with non-Latinos, Latinos in the US have low rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening and low rates of knowledge regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests and guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spanish speaking Latinos have particularly low <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates and screening knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was twofold: (1) to evaluate the effect of a computer-based, Spanish-language <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening decision aid on screening knowledge, intent to obtain screening, and screening self-efficacy in a community sample of Latinos with limited English proficiency (LEP); and (2) to survey these decision aid viewers at four months to determine their rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> discussions with a health care provider as well as their rates of screening test completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 50-75 year old Latinos with LEP who were not current with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants screening viewed a 14 minute multimedia decision aid that addresses <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rationale, recommendations, and options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conducted an uncontrolled (pre-post) study in which we assessed screening knowledge, self-efficacy, and intent at baseline and immediately after decision aid viewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also conducted a follow-up telephone survey of participants at four months to examine rates of patient-provider screening discussions and test completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among n = 80 participants, knowledge scores increased from 20% (before) to 72% (after) decision aid viewing (absolute difference [95%CI]: 52% [46, 59]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion with high screening self-efficacy increased from 67% to 92% (25% [13, 37]); the proportion with high screening intent increased from 63% to 95% (32% [21, 44]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We reached 68 (85%) of 80 participants eligible for the follow-up survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these 36 (53%) reported discussing screening with a provider and 13 (19%) completed a test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Viewing a Spanish-language decision aid increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening knowledge, self-efficacy, and intent among Latinos with LEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Decision aid viewing appeared to promote both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussions with health care providers and test completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The decision aid may be an effective tool for promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and reducing screening disparities in this population </plain></SENT>
