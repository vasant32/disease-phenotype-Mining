<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening practises may be influenced by barriers related to ethnicity and training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mail survey assessed GPs' practises and the barriers towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of screening practises and demography, including GP ethnicity, medical training and practise characteristics, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 212 GPs (median age 54 years, 73% men, 27% Caucasian, 38% foreign graduates), 87% agreed that fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening improved survival in the average-risk patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considerable variations existed in the starting age (40-49 years: 31%; 50 years: 65%) and frequency (1-2 years: 77%; 3-5 years: 22%) of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FOBT was used for indications other than screening: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (59%), altered bowel habits (54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (24%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> (23%), and these were significantly more frequent in Asian GPs independent of medical training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GPs were less likely to recommend screening to immigrants, and most reported that immigrants were less likely to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More Asian and Middle Eastern GPs reported a major barrier with FOBT inaccuracy compared with Caucasian GPs (22% vs 9%, P = 0.03; and 27% vs 9%, P = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Considerable differences existed in GPs' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practises </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indications for use of FOBT and the subsequent investigation of a positive FOBT also varied according to GPs' ethnicity, independent of medical training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient's ethnicity and associated language and cultural barriers may affect screening uptake, which may negatively affect the health of immigrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Resources and culture-specific interventions are recommended to improve overall screening participation </plain></SENT>
