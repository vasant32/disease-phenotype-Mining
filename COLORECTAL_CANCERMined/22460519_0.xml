<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among Dukes' B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, Petersen Index allows stratification to identify those patients whom chemotherapy may benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and three resected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Dukes' B were included prospectively in a database and considered in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to Petersen Index, a score (from 0 to 4) for each patient was calculated on the basis of peritoneal and margin involvement, venous invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four out of 103 tumours were located in the rectum and 79 in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to PI score 59 patients had a score of 0, 30 of 1 and 14 of ≥2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall R0 resection was achieved in 95.1 % of cases and the majority of patients with PI score of ≥2 were R1-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean of harvested lymph nodes was 23.6 (±10.7) with no difference according to the PI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the high-risk group had a worse 5-year survival rate (66.3 %) compared with the other group (P &lt; 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis validated the PI score as a significant independent factor (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both high-quality pathology and adequate harvested lymph nodes are needed for a proper staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even though the influence of PI score on survival is confirmed as it leads to an additional rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> being considered for adjuvant therapy, we underline that a comparison with additional clinical and histological prognostic factors should be needed </plain></SENT>
