<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing strategies to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> among newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and to offer targeted testing to relatives of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We calculated incremental costs per life-year saved for universal testing relative to no testing and age-targeted testing for strategies that use preliminary genetic tests (immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> followed by sequencing of mismatch repair genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for pairs of testing strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Strategies to test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> in newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> using preliminary tests before gene sequencing have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of &lt;or=$45,000 per life-year saved compared with no testing and &lt;or=$75,000 per life-year saved compared with testing restricted to patients younger than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lowest cost testing strategies, using immunohistochemistry as a preliminary test, cost &lt;or=$25,000 per life-year saved relative to no testing and &lt;or=$40,000 per life-year saved relative to testing only patients younger than 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other testing strategies have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios &gt;or=$700,000 per life-year saved relative to the lowest cost strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing the number of relatives tested would improve cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laboratory-based strategies using preliminary tests seem cost-effective from the US health care system perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Universal testing detects nearly twice as many cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> as targeting younger patients and has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparable with other preventive services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding provides support for a recent US recommendation to offer testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
