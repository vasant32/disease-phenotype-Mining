<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> of functional gene polymorphisms <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR C677T) and methionine synthase (A2756G), in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism on outcome and risk of toxicity for adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim was to investigate any possible interdependency between the two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: one hundred and fifty randomly chosen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e>, treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, were genotyped by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient and treatment data were retrieved and assessed for demography, pathology, chemotherapy tolerability and survival after adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms were studied separately and in combination to discover possible interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with MTHFR 677 CC genotype carried lower risks of suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (p=0.027), parasthesia (p=0.0042) and need for dose reduction (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CC genotype was also associated with better survival (p&lt;0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was interdependency with MTR A2756G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with MTR AG/GG in combination with MTHFR CT/TT genotypes carried the highest risk of side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Functional polymorphisms of MTHFR C677T and MTR A2756G can affect outcome and risk of toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their possible interdependence brings attention to the function of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism overall regarding its association with 5-fluoruracil related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results could explain some of the difficulties of obtaining reproducible and uniform results when using single polymorphisms as predictive markers </plain></SENT>
