<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy, the mainstay of this type of screening, allows to establish an early diagnosis and also to eliminate malignant precursor lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The screening test which is performed in Spanish programs is the determination of fecal occult blood using the immunochemical method which gives around 70% of positive values for colonoscopy for any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, in 2009 the National Health System set as an objective that these programs cover 50% of the population by 2015 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is well known that colon screening is highly cost effective with a ratio of around 2500â‚¬ per QALY, much lower than ratios of other programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only the direct costs of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in Spain can be estimated at more than one thousand million euros per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> avoided thanks to screening can reduce these costs by 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact that the introduction of this screening has on health services can be lessened if the indications for colonoscopy are followed adequately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there is no justification for not acting to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and this is especially so in times of crisis as there is no better social cost invested than that which saves suffering, deathsand even money </plain></SENT>
