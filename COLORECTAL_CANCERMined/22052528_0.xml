<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prognostic studies often have to deal with two important challenges: (i) separating effects of predictions on different 'competing' events and (ii) uncertainty about cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multistate Markov models permit multivariable analyses of competing risks of, for example, mortality versus disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, relative survival methods help estimate disease-specific mortality risks even in the absence of data on causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we propose a new Markov relative survival (MRS) model that attempts to combine these two methodologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our MRS model extends the existing multistate Markov piecewise constant intensities model to relative survival modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensity of transitions leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the MRS model is modeled as the sum of an estimable excess hazard of mortality from the disease of interest and an 'offset' defined as the expected hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause 'natural' mortality obtained from relevant life-tables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the new MRS model through simulations, with a design based on registry-based prognostic studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simulation results show almost unbiased estimates of prognostic factor effects for the MRS model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also applied the new MRS model to reassess the role of prognostic factors for mortality in a study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MRS model considerably reduces the bias observed with the conventional Markov model that does not permit accounting for unknown causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, especially if the 'true' effects of a prognostic factor on the two types of mortality differ substantially </plain></SENT>
