<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> has a correspondingly beneficial effect on other disease outcomes is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A role for dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been established through epidemiological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental data aiming to further elucidate this relationship has been somewhat equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies report that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> increases DNA damage, mutagenesis, and <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suggesting inhibited DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While these data connecting <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and inhibition of DNA repair are convincing, we also present data demonstrating that genetic inhibition of DNA repair is protective in the development of preneoplastic colon lesions, both when <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> is depleted and when it is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to (1) give an overview of the data demonstrating a DNA repair defect in response to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, and (2) critically compare and contrast the experimental designs utilized in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> research and the corresponding impact on tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> status and critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggests that there is still an important need for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of differential dietary prescriptions on blood and tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
