<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred seventy-nine patients under 70 years of age and 91 patients 75 years and older were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantification of comorbidities was performed using the Charlson Weighted Comorbidity Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were postoperative complications and 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in the occurrence of postoperative complications between the younger and older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bivariate analysis revealed that patient age was not a risk factor of major complications (odds ratio = 1.2; 95% confidence interval, .6-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although bivariate analysis revealed that older age had a statistically significant odds ratio for 30-day mortality (odds ratio = 12.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-125.4), multivariate analysis revealed that it was a weighted comorbidity index score of 5 or more (P = .02) and long operative time (P = .01) that were independent predictors of 30-day mortality and not age per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age is not an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
