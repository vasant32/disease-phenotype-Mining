<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, laparoscopic colorectal surgery using a single incision usually made at the umbilical area has emerged as a tool to minimize the numbers of scars and provide better cosmetic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But experience in laparoscopic skills is needed to maintain the oncologic principles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery with the restricted operating field during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adding an additional port to single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery (SILS) may be a bridge between conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery and SILS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate whether umbilical incision laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery with one additional port (ULAP) could be performed in a similar manner to conventional multiport surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty-three patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> underwent laparoscopic colectomy between February 2011 and August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty of these patients underwent ULAP and were compared with the other 123 patients who had conventional laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups were similar in age (p = 0.438), gender (p = 0.818), body mass index (p = 0.149), American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) scores (p = 0.417), history of previous abdominal operation (p = 0.503), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (p = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Operation time was longer in the ULAP group (255.5 min) than in the conventional laparoscopic surgery group (144.6 min) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were evident between groups for estimated blood loss (p = 0.263), transfusion requirements (p = 0.841), conversion to open procedures (p = 0.40), length of umbilical incisions (4.6 vs. 4.4 cm, p = 0.628), postoperative hospital stay (p = 0.862), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (p = 0.455), number of harvested lymph nodes (p = 0.203), proximal margins (p = 0.189), and distal resection margins (p = 0.151) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative morbidity (p = 0.736) was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical incision laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery with an additional port is a feasible and safe approach, although it is more time consuming than conventional laparoscopic colectomy </plain></SENT>
