<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the use of a dual-axis confocal (DAC) near-infrared fluorescence microendoscope with a 5.5-mm outer diameter for obtaining clinical images of human colorectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-speed two-dimensional en face scanning was achieved through a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner while a micromotor was used for adjusting the axial focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo images of human patients are collected at 5 frames/sec with a field of view of 362×212 μm(2) and a maximum imaging depth of 140 μm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During routine endoscopy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) was topically applied a nonspecific optical contrasting agent to regions of the human colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DAC microendoscope was then used to obtain microanatomic images of the mucosa by detecting near-infrared fluorescence from ICG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DAC microendoscopy may have utility for visualizing the anatomical and, perhaps, functional changes associated with colorectal pathology for the early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
