<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIM: The complexity and cost of treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients is escalating rapidly and increasingly difficult decisions are being made regarding which interventions provide value for money </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BioGrid Australia supports collection and analysis of comprehensive treatment and outcome data across multiple sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we use preliminary data regarding the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Program (NBCSP) and stage-specific treatment costs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) to demonstrate the potential value of real world data for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data regarding the impact of NBCSP on stage at diagnosis were combined with stage-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment costs and existing literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An incremental CEA was undertaken from a government healthcare perspective, comparing NBCSP with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2008 invited population (n= 681,915) was modelled in both scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness was expressed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related life years saved (LYS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the lifetime and relative to no screening, NBCSP was predicted to save 1265 life years, prevent 225 CRC cases and cost an additional $48.3 million, equivalent to a cost-effectiveness ratio of $38,217 per LYS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A scenario analysis assuming full participation improved this to $23,395 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary CEA based largely on contemporary real world data suggests population-based faecal occult blood test screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is attractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Planned ongoing data collection will enable repeated analyses over time, using the same methodology in the same patient populations, permitting an accurate analysis of the impact of new therapies and changing practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similar CEA using real world data related to other disease types and interventions appears desirable </plain></SENT>
