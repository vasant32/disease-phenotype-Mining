<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of these patients and the correlation between diagnosis near an ED visit and stage at diagnosis were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based sample of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Michigan <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases diagnosed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EDs and other health care settings was used to extract a sample of patients &gt;65 years old, diagnosed with colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> between January 1, 1996, and June 30, 2000 (n = 20Â 311) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regressions were used for the statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis associated with an ED visit were more likely insured by Medicaid before diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.60), had an inpatient admission before diagnosis (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06-1.56), had 3 or more comorbidities (OR, 4.11; 95% CI, 3.53-4.79), were more likely to be female (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31), and were more likely to be aged 85 years and older (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.57-2.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had at least one primary care physician (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) visit before diagnosis were less likely to have a diagnosis associated with an ED visit (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61-0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in association with an ED visit were also more likely to have an inpatient admission before diagnosis (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.43), a higher comorbidity burden (OR, 12.44; 95% CI, 10.18-15.20), be female (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25), African-American (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.21-1.66), and older (80 years and older) (ages 80-84 years: OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57; age 85 years and older: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25-1.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with an ED visit near a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.15-1.42) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> diagnosis (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.44-1.88) were more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage compared with patients diagnosed in other settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An examination of patients' patterns of care leading to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis in association with an ED visit lends insight to conditions precipitating a more immediate diagnosis and their associated outcomes </plain></SENT>
