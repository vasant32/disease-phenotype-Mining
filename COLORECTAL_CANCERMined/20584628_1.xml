<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND SAMPLE: A postal survey was administered to 297 eligible patients who had been treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at a large hospital in the North West of England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were asked to indicate responses to questions comprising likert scales, including views on organisation of care, information and advice, personal experience of care, satisfaction with information and care, views on specialist nursing services and amenability to telephone follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven completed surveys were returned (62.97% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of scale data indicated high levels of satisfaction on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcome measures but sub-optimal rates of satisfaction on some items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents indicated high levels of satisfaction with information related to disease and treatment but lower levels of satisfaction for items related to genetic risk, sexual attractiveness and self care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colorectal nurse specialists were highly rated, especially in terms of information provision and personal experience of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were generally amenable to telephone follow-up, although male patients indicated higher levels of willingness to accept this approach than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with traditional medical based follow-up is generally high in this patient cohort but there is room for improvement in terms of service delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High levels of satisfaction with the care delivered by colorectal nurse specialists and patient acceptance of telephone follow-up suggests nurse-led telephone follow-up is a viable alternative to traditional hospital based follow-up </plain></SENT>
