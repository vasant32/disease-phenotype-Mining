<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (AFAP) is characterized by the presence of 10-99 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease may be associated with mutations in either APC or MUTYH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We purposed to evaluate the contribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC) and MutY homologue (MUTYH) germline alterations to the AFAP phenotype and to identify genotype/phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During counselling for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP), 91 probands (and 107 affected individuals) who met the criteria of AFAP were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two families were screened for constitutional mutations of the APC and MUTYH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MUTYH mutations were detected in 21 families (25.6 % of the 82 tested), and APC mutations in 7 (8.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, constitutional alterations were found in 34.1 % of the probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with APC mutations were younger at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and had a higher mean number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (48.5 ± 33.0 in APC+ individuals vs. 35.7 ± 24.9 in MUTYH+ individuals, and 33.2 ± 18.4 in the "no mutation" group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical features rendered the "no mutation" group closer to MUTYH+ than to the APC+ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> at diagnosis was detected in 40 % of AFAP individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AFAP is a new clinical entity with its frequency in the general population still undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> varies greatly, with an average of 30-40 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of AFAP can be established in approximately 1/3 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both MUTYH and APC genes are implicated in AFAP, though the role of MUTYH is of considerably greater relevance </plain></SENT>
