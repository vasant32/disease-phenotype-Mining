<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This Western Australian, whole-jurisdictional linked-data, retrospective cohort study compared maternal and neonatal outcomes of first postcancer pregnancies among women <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors against randomly selected pregnancies of women with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to investigate a range of adverse outcomes independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its surgical and adjunctive treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 627,762 deliveries during the study period (1983-2007), 232 were first pregnancies following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether following laparoscopic or open <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery, these pregnancies were independently associated with a significantly increased risk of antepartum <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> [odds ratios (ORs): 1.25; 2.13 for the respective procedures], <z:hpo ids='HP_0011891'>postpartum hemorrhage</z:hpo> (ORs: 1.61; 3.31), Cesarean delivery (ORs: 2.42; 4.24), infant low Apgar score (ORs: 1.32; 2.64), need for neonatal resuscitation (ORs: 1.49; 3.20), and special care admission (ORs: 1.42; 2.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A history of open (but not laparoscopic) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery was associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004796'>gastrointestinal obstruction</z:hpo> during pregnancy (OR 1.17) and prolonged postpartum hospitalization (OR 3.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither was significantly associated with perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, rectal (versus colonic) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was independently associated with a significantly higher risk of overall maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes (ORs: 3.73 and 2.73, respectively), as was radiotherapy (ORs: 4.24 and 2.81, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was independently associated with a marginally but significantly higher risk of overall maternal but not neonatal outcomes (ORs: 1.11; 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Open versus laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery was associated with a significantly higher risk of antepartum and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011891'>postpartum hemorrhage</z:hpo>, low Apgar score, need for neonatal resuscitation, and neonatal special care admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, particularly rectal and radiation-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, appear to confer an increased likelihood of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic technique for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgery may reduce adverse gestational outcomes </plain></SENT>
