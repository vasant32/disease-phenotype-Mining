<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our previous work, we showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk variant rs6983267 at 8q24 resides within a TCF4 binding site at the MYC-335 enhancer, with the risk allele G having a stronger binding capacity and Wnt responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we searched for other potential functional variants within MYC-335 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation within MYC-335 was determined in samples from individuals of European, African, and Asian descent, with emphasis on variants in putative transcription factor binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2-bp GA deletion rs67491583 was found to affect a growth factor independent (GFI) binding site and was present only in individuals with African ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation performed in heterozygous cells showed that the GA deletion had an ability to reduce binding of the transcriptional repressors GFI1 and GFI1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening of 1,027 African American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases and 1,773 healthy controls did not reveal evidence for association (odds ratio: 1.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.41, P = 0.095) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, rs67491583 was identified as another functional variant in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-associated enhancer MYC-335, but further studies are needed to establish the role of rs67491583 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> predisposition of African Americans </plain></SENT>
