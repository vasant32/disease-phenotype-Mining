<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> is common after colorectal surgery, but its severity and self-care methods have not been examined in depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To understand changes in and factors influencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> distress and self-care strategies of patients 1 week and 1, 2, and 3 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For this descriptive, longitudinal study, 35 cancer patients were recruited from a teaching hospital in northern Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected in structured, one-on-one interviews at 1 week and 1, 2, and 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variance and effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> distress and number of self-care strategies were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance and generalized estimating equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness scores for self-care strategies were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants' overall level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> symptom distress was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distress level was highest 1 week after surgery, but gradually decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over time after surgery, patients' frequency of using self-care strategies did not differ, but self-care strategies changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dietary modification and exercise were rated as the most effective strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Self-care information for hospitalized patients was primarily provided by medical personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The major factor affecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> distress was defecation frequency, and the major factors affecting self-care strategies were age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage, defecation frequency, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> distress level gradually decreased, and self-care strategies changed with time after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Because health care personnel were the primary source of self-care information for hospitalized patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery, nurses should use these findings to provide supportive treatment and educate patients and their family members about the cause and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Such education should include treatment-induced adverse effects as the basis for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
