<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was: a) to determine the CEA, CA 19-9, EGFR, and EpCAM (GA733-2) levels both in healthy volunteers and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, b) to evaluate the ELISA method for EGFR and EpCAM (GA733-2) measurement, and c) to correlate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker levels with clinicopathological findings in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study was conducted on 50 blood samples obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and 40 blood samples from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CEA and CA 19-9 measurements were performed using electrochemiluminescence immune-assay technology, while EGFR and EpCAM (GA733-2) measurements were performed by an in-house enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CEA, CA 19-9, and EpCAM (GA733-2) levels were higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGFR levels were lower in the patients group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of CA 19-9 and EpCAM (GA733-2) vary at different <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CEA, CA19-9, and EpCAM (GA733-2) vary according to performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CEA, CA 19-9, and EpCAM (GA733-2) showed similar specificity (80%, 80% and 84%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EGFR showed the lowest sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CA 19-9 was the marker with the highest sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The need for convenient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> marker tests with high sensitivity is of great importance for early diagnosis and monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
