<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is recommended to initiate treatment in a period no longer than 30 days since admission in these circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: to know the characteristics and fluency of our Fast Track Diagnostic Pathway (FTDP) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), with special attention to those patients selected for surgical treatment as a first choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who entered the FTDP for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during a period of 2 years (2008-2009) were analyzed as well as the rest of patients also diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> but never seen in the FTDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: of the 316 patients referred to the FTDP only 78 (24.7%) were diagnosed as having some kind of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> derived from the digestive system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end 61 patients (19.3%) were diagnosed with CCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time interval from entry into the FTDP to the first hospital visit was 3 days (range 1-8), and the interval until colonoscopy was performed was 11.5 days (range 1-41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (41.1%) of those patients chosen for surgery were operated on in a period lesser than 30 days while 28 patients (82.3%) underwent surgery before day 45 since admission into the circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: though the functioning of the FTDP is acceptable, any increase in number of patients can generate delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For this reason it is advisable to have a team to assure a good functioning of the FTDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A proper follow-up of the whole process will possibly avoid unnecessary delays and it will improve coordination of the different phases of the fast track pathway and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the diagnostic outcome is poor it is mandatory to implement alternatives programs like screening of asymptomatic population, allowing an early detection of this condition </plain></SENT>
