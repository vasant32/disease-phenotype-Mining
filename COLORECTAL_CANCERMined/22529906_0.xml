<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the results of a global study of dysregulated miRNAs in paired samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> from eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there is existing data of miRNA contribution to colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, these studies are typically small to medium scale studies of cell lines or non-paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study is to our knowledge unique in two respects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and adjacent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue samples are paired, thus taking into account the baseline differences between individuals when testing for differential expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we use high-throughput sequencing, thus enabling a comprehensive survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> miRNAs expressed in the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We use Illumina sequencing technology to perform sequencing and two different tools to statistically test for differences in read counts per gene between samples: edgeR when using the pair information and DESeq when ignoring this information, i.e., treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples as independent groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identify 37 miRNAs that are significantly dysregulated in both statistical approaches, 19 down-regulated and 18 up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of these miRNAs are previously published as potential regulators in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> such as miR-1, miR-96 and miR-145 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our comprehensive survey of differentially expressed miRNAs thus confirms some existing findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have also discovered 16 dysregulated miRNAs, which to our knowledge have not previously been associated with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>: the following significantly down-regulated miR-490-3p, -628-3p/-5p, -1297, -3151, -3163, -3622a-5p, -3656 and the up-regulated miR-105, -549, -1269, -1827, -3144-3p, -3177, -3180-3p, -4326 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the study is preliminary with only eight patients included, we believe the results add to the present knowledge on miRNA dysregulation in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As such the results would serve as a robust training set for validation of potential biomarkers in a larger cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, we also present data supporting the hypothesis that there are differences in miRNA expression between <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumors</z:mpath> of the colon </plain></SENT>
