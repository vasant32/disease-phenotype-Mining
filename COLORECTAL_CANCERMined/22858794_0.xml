<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up surveillance after curative treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients is recommended to detect early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrences</z:e> and improve survival outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a substantial proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients do not undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several demographic and disease-related factors have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus far, patient-centered communication has not been studied as a determinant for undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient-clinician information engagement (PCIE) influences patients' self-reported adherence to recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surveillance procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study was a longitudinal survey among Pennsylvanian patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who were eligible for surveillance and participated in both the baseline and 1-year follow-up surveys were included in this analysis (n = 305) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was self-reported adherence to physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen testing, and colonoscopy according to recommended guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Controlling for potential confounders, higher PCIE at baseline predicted a higher odds for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients reporting adherence to recommended surveillance 1 year later by 2.8 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other significant predictors of adhering to recommended surveillance were a higher education level and having received systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this longitudinal study among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who received curative treatment, greater patient engagement with clinicians about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related information was found to improve patients' subsequent adherence to recommended surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding provides support for encouraging greater patient-physician communication among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
