<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analyzing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> data for Asian/Pacific Islanders collectively masks important differences that exist between individual Asian subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines secular, sex-, age-, and socioeconomic-specific trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence among six Asian subgroups-Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, and South Asian-to determine whether these groups experienced a decline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence and to assess possible differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence trends among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed among Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, Vietnamese, and South Asians between 1988 and 2007 were identified using the California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secular, sex-, age-, and socioeconomic-specific trends in the age-adjusted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence rates for each Asian subgroup were examined using joinpoint analysis to estimate the annual percent change (APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among males, Koreans (APC, 3.6 %) were the only group that experienced a significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among females, Koreans (APC, 2.7 %), South Asians (APC, 2.8 %), and Filipinos (APC, 1.6 %) experienced significant increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratification by age at diagnosis revealed that Korean males (APC, 3.4 %) and females (APC, 2.9 %) as well as Filipino females (APC, 1.8 %) aged 50 years and older experienced a significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Korean males aged less than 50 years (APC, 3.4 %) also experienced a significant increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Japanese (APC, -1.2 %) and Chinese (APC, -1.6 %) males aged 50 years and older experienced a significant decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stratification by socioeconomic status (SES) revealed that Korean males (APC, 2.5 %) and females (APC, 2.9 %) as well as Filipino females (APC, 2.1 %) in the lowest SES category experienced a significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Korean males (APC, 5.2 %) and females (APC, 3.1 %) as well as Filipino males (APC, 1.5 %) in the highest SES category also experienced a significant increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Japanese males (APC, -2.5 %) and females (APC, -2.0 %) as well as Chinese males (APC, -2.8 %) and females (APC, -2.9 %) in the lowest SES category experienced a significant decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Chinese males in the middle (APC, -3.4 %) and highest (APC, -3.5 %) SES categories also experienced significant decreases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the decreasing trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence reported among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major racial/ethnic groups including Asian/Pacific Islanders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is actually increasing among some Asian subgroups in California including Korean males and females, as well as South Asian and Filipino females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence trends for these Asian subgroups differ with respect to age at diagnosis and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that more efforts need to be made to target these populations with culturally sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention and screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>More research is needed to examine the differences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> burden among these populations </plain></SENT>
