<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that MRGBP was upregulated in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, and the enhanced expression was associated with cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated its role in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and searched for genes regulated by MRGBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 47 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in the colon and rectum showed that high levels of MRGBP expression were observed more frequently in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (45%) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (5%), linking its role to malignant properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No clinicopathological factors were associated with the levels MRGBP expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Copy number analysis revealed that gene amplification is involved in the elevated expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide expression analysis identified a total of 41 genes upregulated by MRGBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These genes were implicated in biological processes, including DNA replication, minichromosome maintenance, and cell division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Theses results suggest that MRGBP contributes to colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> through rendering advantages in cell proliferation and/or division of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings might be helpful for the identification of a specific biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the development of diagnostic and/or therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
