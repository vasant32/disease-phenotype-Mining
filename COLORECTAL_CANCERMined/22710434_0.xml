<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we conducted a Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis screen in Rassf1a-null mice to identify candidate genes that collaborate with loss of Rassf1a in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 10 genes, including the transcription factor Runx2, a transcriptional partner of Yes-associated protein (YAP1) that displays <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressive activity through competing with the oncogenic <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> domain family of transcription factors (TEAD) for YAP1 association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While loss of RASSF1A promoted the formation of oncogenic YAP1-TEAD complexes, the combined loss of both RASSF1A and RUNX2 further increased YAP1-TEAD levels, showing that loss of RASSF1A, together with RUNX2, is consistent with the multistep model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically, RUNX2 expression was frequently downregulated in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and reduced RUNX2 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell or atypical Burkitt/Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, decreased expression levels of RASSF1 and RUNX2 were observed in both precursor T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, further supporting the hypothesis that dual regulation of YAP1-TEAD promotes oncogenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings provide evidence that loss of RASSF1A expression switches YAP1 from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor to an oncogene through regulating its association with transcription factors, thereby suggesting a novel mechanism for RASSF1A-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression </plain></SENT>
