<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to clarify the risk factors for delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after endoscopic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>â‰¥20 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic submucosal dissection cases were excluded because of the low incidence of delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after such procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study using a prospectively completed database and patient medical records at a single, national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 403 colorectal endoscopic resections were performed on 375 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the database and retrospectively assessed patient age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and current use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) or antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>) as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, size, macroscopic type, histopathological findings, resection method and whether or not placement of prophylactic clips was performed during the endoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall rate of delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was 4.2% (17/403) and the median interval between endoscopic resection and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was 2 days (range, 1-14 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> cases were successfully controlled by endoscopic hemostasis involving clipping and/or electrocoagulation without the need for surgical interventions or blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on our univariate analysis, the delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate was significantly higher in both males (P=0.04) and those patients without prophylactic clip placement (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study results indicated that prophylactic clip placement may be an effective method for preventing delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> after endoscopic resection for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
