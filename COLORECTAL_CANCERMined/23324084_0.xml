<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and microarray quality assessment form an integral part of gene expression analysis and, although methods such as the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> integrity number (RIN) algorithm reliably asses <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> integrity, the relevance of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> integrity in gene expression analysis as well as analysis methods to accommodate the possible effects of degradation requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> integrity and array quality on the commonly used Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST array platform using reliable within-array and between-array quality assessment measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a transcript specific bias in the apparent effect of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> degradation on the measured gene expression signal was evaluated after either excluding quality-flagged arrays or compensation for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> degradation at different steps in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using probe-level and inter-array quality metrics to assess 34 Gene 1.0 ST array datasets derived from historical, paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples, 7 arrays (20.6%), with a mean sample RIN of 3.2 (SD = 0.42), were flagged during array quality assessment while 10 arrays from samples with RINs &lt; 7 passed quality assessment, including one sample with a RIN &lt; 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected a transcript length bias in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> degradation in only 5.8% of annotated transcript clusters (p-value 0.05, FC ≥ |2|), with longer and shorter than average transcripts under- and overrepresented in quality-flagged samples respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applying compensatory measures for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> degradation performed at least as well as excluding quality-flagged arrays, as judged by hierarchical clustering, gene expression analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; importantly, use of these compensatory measures had the significant benefit of enabling lower quality array data from irreplaceable clinical samples to be retained in downstream analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrate an effective array-quality assessment strategy, which will allow the user to recognize lower quality arrays that can be included in the analysis once appropriate measures are applied to account for known or unknown sources of variation, such as array quality- and batch- effects, by implementing ComBat or Surrogate Variable Analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This approach of quality control and analysis will be especially useful for clinical samples with variable and low <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> qualities, with RIN scores ≥ 2 </plain></SENT>
