<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> microsatellite instability (MSI) status and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status are indicators of patient outcome, but the molecular events that give rise to these outcomes remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wnt5a is a critical regulator of non-canonical Wnt activity and promoter hypermethylation of this gene has emerging prognostic roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however the frequency and prognostic significance of this epigenetic event have not been explored in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumour</z:e> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we investigated the frequency and prognostic significance of Wnt5a methylation in a large cohort of MSI-stratified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Methylation was quantified in a large cohort of 1232 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from two clinically distinct populations from Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations were examined between methylation status and clinicopathlogical features, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> MSI status, BRAF V600E mutation, and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Ontario, Wnt5a methylation was strongly associated with MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> after adjustment for age, sex, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location (odds ratio (OR)=4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.4-7.4, P&lt;10(-6)) and with BRAF V600E mutation, a marker of CIMP (OR=12.3, 95% CI=6.9-21.7, P&lt;10(-17)), but was not associated with patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concordant results were obtained in Newfoundland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Methylation of Wnt5a is associated with distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> subtypes, strengthening the evidence of an epigenetic-mediated Wnt bias in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
