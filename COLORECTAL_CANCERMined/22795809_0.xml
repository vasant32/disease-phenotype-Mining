<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compare efficacy and toxicity of oral ferrous bisglycinate chelate and ferrous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with mild IDA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and ferritin obtained at diagnosis, 1 and 2 months from the beginning of treatment were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) related to the two treatments were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 12 patients treated with ferrous bisglycinate chelate, basal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and ferritin values (mean±SD) were 11.6±0.8 g/dL and 16.1±8.0 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 months of treatment, they were 13.0±1.4 g/dL and 33.8±22.0 ng/mL, respectively (P=0.0003 and P=0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with ferrous <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and ferritin mean values were 11.3±0.6 g/dL and 19.0±6.4 ng/mL basally, and 12.7±0.70 g/dL and 40.8±28.1 ng/mL (P&lt;0.0001 and P=0.017) after 2 months of treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data suggest that ferrous bisglycinate chelate has similar efficacy and likely lower GI toxicity than ferrous <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> given at the conventional dose of 105 mg per day for the same time </plain></SENT>
