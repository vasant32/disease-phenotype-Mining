<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Although a randomized trial demonstrated a survival benefit of cytoreductive surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) over systemic chemotherapy alone, the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CRPC) is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate long-term outcome after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> and to identify the prognostic factors associated with a cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Patients were considered cured if the disease-free survival interval lasted at least 5 years after the treatment of CRPC or its last recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had died postoperatively, or from non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, or patients with a follow-up of less than 5 years since the last curative treatment were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: From 1995 to 2006, 107 patients (median age, 48 years; range, 19-67 years) underwent complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>, followed by <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications occurred in 50 patients (53%), including 4 postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 77 months (range, 60-144 months), 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 35% and 15%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (16%) were considered cured after a disease-free interval of at least 5 years, of whom 14 never developed a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cured patients had a significantly lower median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153467" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal cancer</z:e> index than noncured patients, respectively 4 (3-16) and 12 (2-36) (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153467" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal cancer</z:e> index of 10 or less was the only independent factor predicting cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: The cure rate (16%) after complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e>, followed by <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, in selected patients is close to that obtained after resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
