<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates remain low when compared to other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our team investigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening education prior to recommended age for screening to better understand screening perceptions among AI community members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our research team conducted 11 focus groups with AI men and women aged 30-49 (N = 39 men and N = 31 women) in Kansas and Missouri </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that community members (1) have little knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, (2) do not openly discuss <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and (3) want additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variations existed among men and women's groups, but they agreed that preventive measures need to be appropriate for AI communities </plain></SENT>
