<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and extrapolated detection rate of proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> at screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The study involved secondary analyses that used two databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first includes screening colonoscopies performed by 15 attending gastroenterologists at two academic endoscopy units between 2000 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second includes average-risk patients who had previously participated in a randomized trial comparing high-definition chromocolonoscopy and white-light colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> found by the highest-level detectors and proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rates corresponding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates of 25% in men and 15% in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed 6681 procedures from the first database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean (± standard deviation) detection rates for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were 38% ± 7.8% (range 17%-47%) and 13% ± 4.8% (1%-18%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between detection rates for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> for men (R = 0.71; P = .003) and women (R = 0.73; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates of 25% for men and 15% for women both corresponded to a detection rate of 4.5% for proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> found by the highest-level detector was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The corresponding rate derived from the high-definition screening colonoscopy database was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of proximal colon serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in average-risk patients undergoing screening colonoscopy is higher than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An extrapolated proximal serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate of 5% is suggested for average-risk men and women </plain></SENT>
