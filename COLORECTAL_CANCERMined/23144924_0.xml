<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APC and Axin are key components of the β-catenin destruction complex that acts to promote β-catenin degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of Axin are in turn controlled by tankyrases, members of the PARP-family of poly-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-ribosylation enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, which typically harbor APC mutations, inhibition of tankyrase activity promotes Axin stabilization and attenuates Wnt signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the effect of inhibiting tankyrases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that application of the small molecule tankyrase inhibitor, XAV939 or siRNA-mediated abrogation of tankyrase expression increases Axin1 and Axin2 protein levels and attenuates Wnt-induced transcriptional responses in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 cells, inhibiton of tankyrase activity also attenuate Wnt3a induced cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in both <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, XAV939 inhibits cell growth under conditions of serum-deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of serum prevents this growth inhibitory effect, although inhibition of Wnt-induced transcriptional and migratory responses was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that stabilization of Axin by inhibition of tankyrases alone, may not be an effective means to block <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth and that combinatorial therapeutic approaches should be considered </plain></SENT>
