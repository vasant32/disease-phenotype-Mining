<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In some biomedical studies, biomarkers are measured repeatedly along some spatial structure or over time and are subject to measurement error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these studies, it is often of interest to evaluate associations between a clinical endpoint and these biomarkers (also known as functional biomarkers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are potentially two levels of correlation in such data, namely, between repeated measurements of a biomarker from the same subject and between multiple biomarkers from the same subject; none of the existing methods accounts for correlation between multiple functional biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose a Bayesian approach to model a clinical outcome of interest (e.g. risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) in the presence of multiple functional biomarkers while accounting for potential correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our simulations show that the proposed approach achieves good performance in finite samples under various settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of substantial or moderate correlation, the proposed approach outperforms an existing approach that does not account for correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed approach is applied to a study of biomarkers of risk for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and our results show that the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is associated with two functional biomarkers, APC and TGF-Î±, in particular, with their values in the region between the proliferating and differentiating zones of colorectal crypts </plain></SENT>
