<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined 40 colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 30 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue samples (10 proximal colon, 10 distal colon, and 10 rectal paired with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases) to examine miRNA expression profiles in colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MiRNA expression levels were adjusted for multiple comparisons; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue was compared with noncancerous tissue from the same site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue showed 287 unique miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed at the 1.5-fold level and 73 with over a two-fold difference in expression between colon and rectal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed at the 1.5-fold level by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype showed 143 unique miRNAs differentially expression for microsatellite instability positive (MSI+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e>; 129 unique miRNAs differentially expressed for CpG Island Methylator Phenotype positive (CIMP+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e>; 135 miRNAs were differentially expressed for KRAS2-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e>, and 139 miRNAs were differentially expressed for TP53-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar numbers of differentially expressed miRNAs were observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e>, although the miRNAs differentially expressed differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 129 unique miRNAs for CIMP+, 143 unique miRNAs for KRAS2-mutated, and 136 unique miRNAs for TP53-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the importance of miRNAs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the need for studies that can confirm these results and provide insight into the diet, lifestyle, and genetic factors that influence miRNA expression </plain></SENT>
