<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This research aimed to validate the specificity of the newly developed nanobeacon for imaging the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thomsen</z:e>-Friedenreich (TF) antigen, a potential biomarker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The imaging agent is comprised of a submicron-sized <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> nanosphere encapsulated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51942">Coumarin 6</z:chebi> dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surface of the nanosphere was modified with peanut agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) and poly(N-vinylacetamide (PNVA) moieties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former binds to <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-β(1-3)GalNAc with high affinity while the latter enhances the specificity of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> for the carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the nanobeacon was evaluated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and specimens, and the data were compared with immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, distribution of the nanobeacon in vivo was assessed using an "intestinal loop" mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of the data indicated that approximately 2 μg of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> were detected for each milligram of the nanobeacon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nanobeacon specifically reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> by recognizing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigen through the surface-immobilized <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Removal of TF from human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and tissues resulted in a loss of fluorescence signal, which suggests the specificity of the probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the probe was not absorbed systematically in the large intestine upon topical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, no registered toxicity was associated with the probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate the potential use of this novel nanobeacon for imaging the TF antigen as a biomarker for the early detection and prediction of the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
