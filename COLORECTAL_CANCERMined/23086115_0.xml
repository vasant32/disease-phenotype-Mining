<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The automated retrieval console (ARC) is natural language processing (NLP)-based software that allows text-based document-level classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of ARC in identifying surveillance and non-surveillance colonoscopy in IBD using EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a split validation study of electronic reports of colonoscopy pathology for patients with IBD from the Michael E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DeBakey VA Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A gastroenterologist manually classified pathology reports as either derived from surveillance or non-surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathology reports were randomly split into two sets: 70 % for algorithm derivation and 30 % for validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An ARC generated classification model was applied to the validation set of pathology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The performance of the model was compared with manual classification for surveillance and non-surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 575 colonoscopy pathology reports were available on 195 IBD patients, of which 400 reports were designated as training and 175 as testing sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within the testing set, a total of 69 pathology reports were classified as surveillance by manual review, whereas the ARC model classified 66 reports as surveillance for a recall of 0.77, precision of 0.80, and specificity of 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ARC was able to identify surveillance colonoscopy for IBD without customized software programming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NLP-based document-level classification may be used to differentiate surveillance from non-surveillance colonoscopy in IBD </plain></SENT>
