<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were recruited from January 2006 to April 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The information about tea consumption was collected by a structured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were diagnosed based on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four single-nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLA2G4A gene were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression models were used for assessing the joint effects between tea consumption and SNPs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 296 controls well-matched were used in the final analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant individual associations between four SNPs (rs6666834, rs10911933, rs4650708 and rs7526089) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, their CTAC haplotype was significantly associated with the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 3.06; 95%CI = 1.52-6.19), compared with TCAC haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Drinking tea was correlated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after adjustment for covariates (OR = 0.61; 95%CI = 0.39-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, compared with no-tea drinkers with TT/CT genotype of rs6666834, tea drinkers with TT/CT or CC had significant lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.36-1.00 for TT/CT; 0.38, 0.19-0.74 for CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The joint effects between the remaining three SNPs and drinking tea on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were observed as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were observed on colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tea consumption and haplotype of mutants in PLA2G4A gene were respectively associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PLA2G4A mutants modified the protective effect of tea consumption against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
