<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> induced by germ-line mutations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor APC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These initiate the early stages of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence in familial, but also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> (in 80% to 90%), colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found the presence of APC-like sequences in bacteria of FAP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: We analyzed bacteria isolated from FAP patients' rectal swabs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA was isolated and analyzed for detection of APC-like sequences using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also tested DNA homology rate and APC-like protein production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We collected blood samples and rectal swabs from patients with confirmed diagnosis of FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were analyzed for presence of sections from exon 15 of the APC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most positive results were found in sections located exactly in the area called the MCR (mutation cluster region), where the highest frequency of APC gene mutations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By sequencing PCR products from bacteria in section F-G together with a patient's DNA sample and human APC gene, we found a more than 90% DNA homology rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed production of APC-like protein using Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested two hypotheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The APC-like protein might have same function as a truncated APC product, which is synthesized in most cases of mutations of APC gene in the MCR region in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, we can consider the possible existence of horizontal transfer of genetic information between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our study can be considered as a pilot project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For confirmation of our hypotheses, further research is needed </plain></SENT>
