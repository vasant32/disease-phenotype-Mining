<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age-related survival differences may be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or treatment related, but also due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to compare population-based survival data for young (&lt;65 years), aged (65-74 years), and elderly (≥75 years) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients operated for stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1991 and 2005 in the western region of The Netherlands were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude survival, relative survival, and conditional relative survival curves, under the condition of surviving 1 year, were made for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 30-day, 1-year, and 1-year excess mortality data were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 9,397 stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crude survival curves showed clear survival differences between the age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These age-related differences were less prominent in relative survival and disappeared in conditional relative survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only in stage III disease did elderly patients have worse <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> than young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant age-related differences in 30-day and 1-year excess mortality were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality vastly underestimated 1-year mortality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who survive the first year have the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related survival as younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, decreased survival in the elderly is mainly due to differences in early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment of elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients should focus on perioperative care and the first postoperative year </plain></SENT>
