<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The present paper is a first evaluation of the use of "CEAwatch", a clinical support software system for surgeons for the follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This system gathers Carcino-Embryonic Antigen (CEA) values and automatically returns a recommendation based on the latest values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients receiving follow-up care for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> fulfilling our in- and exclusion criteria were identified to participate in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From August 2008, when the software was introduced, patients were asked to undergo the software-supported follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Safety of the follow-up, experiences of working with the software, and technical issues were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 245 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The software-supported group contained 184 patients; the control group contained 61 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The software was safe in finding the same amount of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> with fewer outpatient visits, and revealed few technical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinicians experienced a decrease in follow-up workload of up to 50% with high adherence to the follow-up scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEAwatch is an efficient software tool helping clinicians working with large numbers of follow-up patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of outpatient visits can safely be reduced, thus significantly decreasing workload for clinicians </plain></SENT>
