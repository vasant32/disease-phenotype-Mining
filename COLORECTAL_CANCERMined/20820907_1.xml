<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has produced promising results when combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to define the immunological profile of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at baseline and following chemotherapy with either irinotecan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/leucovorin (IFL) alone or IFL in combination with.bevacizumab (B-IFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) (n = 20) and patients (n = 40) were tested for T-cell proliferation in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (auto-MLR), and cytokine production following stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PBMCs obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients prior to treatment exhibited lower auto-MLR responses and low production of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-18 cytokines, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines were increased as compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters) following in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During treatment, and in particular in week 12 of evaluation, IL-2 (p &lt; 0.001 for both IFL and B-IFL groups), IFN-γ (p &lt; 0.001 for IFL and p = 0.001 for B-IFL), IL-12 (p &lt; 0.001 for both IFL and B-IFL) and IL-18 (p &lt; 0.001 for both IFL and B-IFL) production, as well as auto-MLR responses increased (p &lt; 0.001 for both IFL and B-IFL), whereas IL-4 (p &lt; 0.001 for IFL and p = 0.001 for B-IFL) and IL-10 [p &lt; 0.001 for IFL and p = 0.067 (non-significant) for B-IFL] production decreased over baseline in the two treatment groups, yet their respective values never reached those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-2, IFN-γ production, and auto-MLR were higher in the B-IFL over the IFL treatment group (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.04, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the abnormal immune parameters observed in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at presentation can substantially improve during treatment with either IFL or B-IFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immune parameters examined can provide a sensitive and valuable tool for monitoring immune function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and could be applied as surrogate markers predicting treatment-related outcome </plain></SENT>
