<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information on GI endoscopy resources in Nigeria is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Training, cost, availability and maintenance of equipment are some unique challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite these challenges, the quality and completion rates are important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective audit of endoscopic procedures by an endoscopist in a Nigerian hospital over a 24 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ninety endoscopic procedures were performed in 187 patients (109 male, 78 female) by a surgeon during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 47.6 years (range 17 - 90 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-two procedures (64.2%) were upper GI endoscopy, 52 (27.4%) colonoscopy and 16 (8.4%) sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Majority of endoscopies 182 (95.8%) were performed electively and only 7 (3.7%) were therapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upper GI endoscopy findings included 14 (11.5%) cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> disease, 5 complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162651" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric outlet obstruction</z:e>, and 21 (17.3%) cases of upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy findings included 7 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Commonest lesion on lower GI endoscopy was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemorrhoids</z:e> (41.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adjusted caecal intubation was 81.4% for colonoscopies performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate for male and female patients were 18.2% and 5.3% respectively; in patients over 50 years these were 6.3% and 14.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two complications, rupture of oesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> patient occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An endoscopist can perform GI endoscopy effectively in developing countries like Nigeria but attention to equipment need and training is important </plain></SENT>
