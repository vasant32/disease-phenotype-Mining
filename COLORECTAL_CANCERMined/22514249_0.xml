<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Considerable disparities exist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence and mortality rates between blacks and whites in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated how much of these disparities could be explained by differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and stage-specific relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model to estimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality rates in blacks, aged 50 years and older, from 1975 to 2007 assuming they had: (i) the same trends in screening rates as whites instead of observed screening rates (incidence and mortality); (ii) the same trends in stage-specific relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival rates as whites instead of observed (mortality only); and (iii) a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The racial disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality rates attributable to differences in screening and/or stage-specific relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival were then calculated by comparing rates from these scenarios to the observed black rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Differences in screening accounted for 42% of disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and 19% of disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality between blacks and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six percent of the disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality could be attributed to differences in stage-specific relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together screening and survival explained a little more than 50% of the disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality between blacks and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differences in screening and relative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival are responsible for a considerable proportion of the observed disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality rates between blacks and whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Enabling blacks to achieve equal access to care as whites could substantially reduce the racial disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
