<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods: In 110 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, immunohistochemical stains were performed using Maspin, p53, VEGFA, CD31, and CD105 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and microsatellite status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new scoring system for Maspin, based on the dual cytoplasmic-nuclear expression, with possible predictive value, was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> presented an oscillating pattern, the VEGF expression was more intense in Stage IV, but the endothelial area that quantified with both CD31 and CD105 was smaller than in those cases diagnosed in Stages II and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the p53 negative cases with Maspin nuclear predominance, which seems to respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi>, were microsatellite instability (MSI) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Stage II, Maspin nuclear positivity was more specific for pT4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and aggressive cases with high p53 index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed in Stage II and 27% of those from Stage III presented Maspin expression in the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No cases from Stage IV had Maspin vascular positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Maspin nuclear expression, associated with p53 ones, might be used either to select the high-risk microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> diagnosed in Stage II or those MSI cases which can respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
