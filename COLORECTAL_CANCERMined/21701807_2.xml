<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although widely used, there is a lack of evidence concerning the diagnostic accuracy of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell counts (WBCs) in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CRP and WBCs in predicting postoperative inflammatory complications after open resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical data and the CRP and WBCs, routinely measured until postoperative day 5 (POD 5), were available for 1,187 patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery between 1997 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) methodology, the diagnostic accuracy was evaluated according to the area under the curve (AUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred forty-seven patients (29.2%; 95% CI, 26.7-31.9%) developed various inflammatory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leakage occurred in 8.0% (95% CI, 6.1-9.1%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CRP level on POD 4 (AUC 0.76; 95% CI, 0.71-0.81) had the highest diagnostic accuracy for the early detection of inflammatory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a cutoff of 123 mg/l, the sensitivity was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.56-0.74), and the specificity was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of the WBC was significantly lower compared to CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of CRP on POD 4 is recommended to screen for inflammatory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CRP values above 123 mg/l on POD 4 should raise suspicion of inflammatory complications, although the discriminatory performance was insufficient to provide a single threshold that could be used to correctly predict inflammatory complications in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>WBC measurement contributes little to the early detection of inflammatory complications </plain></SENT>
