<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (FAK) plays a crucial role in the biological processes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, such as cell attachment, migration, proliferation and survival, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are essential for the progression of peritoneal dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since we and other groups have reported that the inhibition of FAK activity exhibited a potent anticancer effect in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516211" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">cancer models</z:e>, we hypothesized that TAE226, a novel ATP-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> designed to target FAK, can prevent the occurrence and progression of peritoneal dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro, TAE226 greatly inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCT116 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, while their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> on the matrix surface was minimally inhibited when FAK activity and expression was suppressed by TAE226 and siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, when HCT116 cells were intraperitoneally inoculated in mice, the cells could attach to the peritoneum and begin to grow within 24 h regardless of the pretreatment of cells with TAE226 or FAK-siRNA, suggesting that FAK is not essential, at least for the initial integrin-matrix contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the treatment of mice before and after inoculation significantly suppressed cell attachment to the peritoneum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, oral administration of TAE226 greatly reduced the size of disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and prolonged survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, a possible strategy for inhibiting peritoneal dissemination by targeting FAK with TAE226 appears to be applicable through anti-proliferative and anti-invasion/anti-migration mechanisms </plain></SENT>
