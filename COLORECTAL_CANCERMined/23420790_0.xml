<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to address this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the expression of ZEB1 between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent mucosa using quantitative real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of ZEB1 expression with clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed by appropriate statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the association of ZEB1 expression with survival of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the relative expression levels of ZEB1 were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent mucosa and higher expression of ZEB1 correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high ZEB1 had a poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the multivariate analysis showed that high expression of ZEB1 was an independent predictor of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate the potential of ZEB1 as a novel prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
