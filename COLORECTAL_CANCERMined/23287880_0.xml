<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed and tested the feasibility of a computer-based CSGA in patients â‰¥70 years of age who were receiving treatment for gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> at the Dana-Farber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From December 2009 to June 2011, patients were invited to complete the CSGA at baseline (start of new treatment) and follow-up (at the first of 4 months later or within 4 weeks of completing treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Feasibility endpoints were proportion of eligible patients consented, proportion completing CSGA at baseline and follow-up, time to complete CSGA, and proportion of physicians reporting CSGA results that led to a change in clinical decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 49 eligible patients, 38 consented (76% were treatment naive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 77 years (range: 70-89 years), and 48% were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean physician-rated Karnofsky Performance Status was 87.5 at baseline (SD 8.4) and 83.5 at follow-up (SD 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 92% used a touchscreen computer; 97% completed the CSGA (51% independently) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients used a touchscreen computer; 71% completed the CSGA (41% independently) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean time to completion was 23 minutes at baseline (SD 8.4) and 20 minutes at follow-up (SD 5.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CSGA added information to clinical assessment for 75% at baseline (n = 27) and 65% at follow-up (n = 17), but it did not alter immediate clinical decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The computer-based CSGA feasibility endpoints were met, although approximately half of patients required assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CSGA added information to clinical assessment but did not affect clinical decision-making, possibly due to limited alternate treatment options in this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
