<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between endogenous <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data on lifestyle, medical history, and diet (through 2008), along with blood samples, from the Nurses' Health Study, the Women's Health Study, the Health Professional Follow-up Study, and the Physicians' Health Study II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">estrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> binding globulin (SHBG), and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> among 730 women (293 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 437 healthy individuals as controls) and 1158 men (439 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 719 controls) and used unconditional logistic regression to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were 2-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, SHBG, and the ratio of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in men after adjustments for matching and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including body mass index and plasma levels of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RRs in the highest relative to the lowest quartile were 0.62 for <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.96), 0.65 for SHBG (95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.99), and 2.63 for the ratio (95% confidence interval, 1.58-4.36) (P values for trend â‰¤ .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in women, only the ratio of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was (inversely) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after adjustments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors (RR, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.84; P value for trend = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of combined data from 4 population studies, there appears to be an association between levels of sex hormones and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There also appears to be an inverse association between the ratio of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
