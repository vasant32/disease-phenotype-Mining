<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate radiological assessment is vital to enable an appropriate surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to analyse the accuracy of IOUS compared with that of preoperative imaging (POI) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis of 51 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for CRLM was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of POI and IOUS were correlated and compared with histopathological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses included t-tests, to compare continuous variables, and chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to compare categorical variables. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant RESULTS: POI correlated with histology in 35 patients (68.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity were 82.4% and 86.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IOUS correlated with histology in 31 (60.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity were 84.3% and 76.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in accuracy between modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of POI combined with IOUS correlated with histology in 40 patients (78.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity were 88.2% and 84.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of combined modalities was significantly greater than IOUS or POI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: POI combined with IOUS may significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM </plain></SENT>
