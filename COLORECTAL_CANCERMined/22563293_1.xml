<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-operative perfusion CTs were performed with a 64-channel multidetector row CT in 27 patients (17 women and 10 men; age range 32-82 years) who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> involving the sigmoid and rectum between August 2006 and November 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgery without pre-operative chemotherapy or radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dynamic perfusion CTs were performed for 65 seconds after intravenous injection of contrast medium (100 mL, 300 mg of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> per mL, 5 mL/sec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, blood flow (BF), blood volume, mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), and permeability-surface area product were measured in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After surgery, one gastrointestinal pathologist evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade and performed immunohistochemical staining using CD 34 to determine MVD in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare CT perfusion parameters with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, and Pearson's correlation analysis was used to correlate CT perfusion parameters with MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 27 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grading was as follows: well differentiated (n = 8); moderately differentiated (n = 15); and poorly differentiated (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BF was higher in moderately differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than well differentiated and poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (p = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was shorter in moderately differentiated than well differentiated and poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MVD was greater in poorly differentiated than well differentiated and moderately differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (p = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between other perfusion parameters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between CT perfusion parameters and MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> measurement by perfusion CT is effective in predicting moderately differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, perfusion CT is limited in distinguishing well differentiated and poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative perfusion CT does not reflect the MVD of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
