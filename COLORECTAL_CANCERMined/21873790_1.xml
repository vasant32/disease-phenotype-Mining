<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the change of inflammatory factors at different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 30 patients with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and 120 CRC patients at different stages were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG, IgM, and IgA levels, the inflammatory cytokines IL-2, 4, 6, 10, and 12 and the expression of TGF-β 1 and VEGF in the serum were analyzed by ELISA or immunoturbidimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum concentrations of IL-12, TGF-β 1, and IL-6 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were statistically different compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath>, and increased as the disease progressed (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-6 reached the highest level in C phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>.The serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were significantly different among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF serum levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Phase A and Phase B compared with other groups were statistically different, but other serum concentrations had no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum level of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the 3 groups showed no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The serum level of inflammatory cytokines TGF-β 1, IL-6, and IL-12 increases gradually with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which may change the microcirculation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and promote the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
