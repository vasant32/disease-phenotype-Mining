<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Identifying an accurate, reliable, affordable, and acceptable noninvasive screening test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) would greatly facilitate population screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Published literature from 2000 through February 2012 on noninvasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests was identified, reviewed, and summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest quality evidence for noninvasive screening exists for guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBTs), for which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific incidence and mortality reductions are modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) offer better sensitivity and comparable specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional studies comparing gFOBTs and FITs suggest that FITs provide higher detection of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modeling studies favor FITs over gFOBTs with respect to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A myriad of studies report the performance of fecal-based and blood-based genetic and protein-based biomarkers; the studies differ in patient population assembled, marker selection, and assay methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several markers and panels of markers are promising, although nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies focus on new markers and/or assay methods on small sets of referred patients rather than validating markers using optimal assays in a screening setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the absence of long-term randomized trials, adoption of the noninvasive tests will require cross-sectional data on test characteristics obtained from the screening setting, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevalence is low and the full spectrum of colorectal findings exists, along with estimates of cumulative risks, benefits, and cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Test adoption will ultimately depend on test characteristics, availability, affordability, and user appeal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no noninvasive substitute for the currently recommended screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FITs should replace gFOBTs wherever gFOBTs are used for screening </plain></SENT>
