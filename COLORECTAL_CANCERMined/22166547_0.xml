<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical data of patients operated on for primarily detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in years 1993-2002 was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Usefulness of follow-up means such as physical examination, or CEA and endoscopic surveillance was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mentioned above were applied to scheduled follow-up (in 3, 6 and 12 month intervals following an operation and annually after that by the year 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete and reliable data was obtained from 340 out of 502 follow-up intended subjects (67.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated CEA was the most frequent predictor of recurrence within non-symptomatic subjects meeting follow-up appointments (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> set back diagnosed by means of either physical or endoscopic examinations was the case only in one out of five patients (20.75% and 18.87% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of recurrence making patients meet an unscheduled appointment was found increasing relative risk of nothing-but-palliative option either for them with local set back, or meta-static spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of meta-chronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> was significantly higher in patients being affected by synchronous advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> at time of surgery compared to those with one-fold changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CEA scheduled follow-up after treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> seems adequate to provide a good outcome of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
