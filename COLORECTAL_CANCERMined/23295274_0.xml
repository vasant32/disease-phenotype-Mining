<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR) is a key measure of quality in colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low ADRs are associated with development of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after "negative" colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Uncontrolled studies mandating longer withdrawal time, and other incentives, have not significantly improved ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that an endoscopist training program would increase ADRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP) was an educational intervention for staff endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured ADRs for a baseline period, then randomly assigned half of the 15 endoscopists to undergo EQUIP training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then examined baseline and post-training study ADRs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endoscopists (trained and un-trained) to evaluate the impact of training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,200 procedures were completed in each of the two study phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar between randomization groups and between study phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall ADR in baseline phase was 36% for both groups of endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the post-training phase, the group of endoscopists randomized to EQUIP training had an increase in ADR to 47%, whereas the ADR for the group of endoscopists who were not trained remained unchanged at 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect of training on the endoscopist-specific ADRs was estimated with an odds ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval 1.24-2.41, P=0.0013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ADRs can be improved considerably through simple educational efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, a trial involving a larger number of endoscopists is needed to validate the utility of our training methods and determine whether improvements in ADRs lead to reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
