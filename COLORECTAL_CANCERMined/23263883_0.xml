<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This community-based participatory research study explores if mailing educational pamphlets to Nikkei families can influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge, attitudes, and screening adherence; and trigger intergenerational communication about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 56 parent-offspring dyads contacted, 24 were eligible (e.g., no prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening/diagnosis) and were randomized into 3 cohorts defined by the "target recipient(s)" of study pamphlets about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening: parent only, offspring only, and both parent and offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 19 completed dyads (79.2 %â€‰= 19/24), results showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge of most pamphlet recipients increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cohorts; however, some misinformation and attitudinal barriers persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although some parent-offspring communication about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased after mailing pamphlets to offspring, only spousal communication occurred after mailing pamphlets to parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional benefits were not observed in increasing parental screening intent/behavior after mailing pamphlets to both parent and offspring </plain></SENT>
