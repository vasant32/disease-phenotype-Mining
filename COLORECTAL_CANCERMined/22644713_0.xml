<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> at 2 years and decline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers were the primary end-points of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 121 liver lesions were evaluated in 25 patients (14 men, 11 women) with liver-dominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and CECT before and 6-8 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in SUV(max), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density measured in terms of Hounsfield units and the sum of the longest diameters (LD) were calculated for the target liver lesions in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient responses to treatment were categorized using EORTC PET criteria, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density criteria (Hounsfield units) and RECIST, and were correlated with the responses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers and 2-year PFS using Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank test for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate proportional hazards (Cox) regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of relevant prognostic factors on PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using (18)F-FDG PET/CT response criteria, 15 patients had a partial response (PR) and 10 patients had stable disease (SD), while using RECIST only 2 patients had a PR and 23 had SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a PR, 21 SD and 2 progressive disease using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean changes in SUV(max), sum of the LDs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density after treatment were 2.9 ± 2.6, 7.3 ± 14.4 mm and 1.9 ± 13.18 HU, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a PR on (18)F-FDG PET/CT had a mean decrease of 44.5 % in SUV(max) compared to those with SD who had a decrease of only 10.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decreases in SUV(max) and sum of the LDs were significant (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) while the decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density was not (p &gt; 0.1065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The responses on the (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies were highly correlated with the responses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers (p &lt; 0.0001 for LDH, p = 0.01 for CEA and p = 0.02 for Ca19-9), while the responses on the CECT studies using both RECIST and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density criteria were not significantly correlated with the responses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The responses on (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies also significantly predicted PFS (the median PFS in those with a PR was 12.0 months and in those with SD was 5 months, p &lt; 0.0001), while RECIST and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density did not significantly predict PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that responses on (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies and decreases in SUV(max) of ≤ 2.0 were the strongest predictors of PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early response assessment to (90)Y-radioembolization using (18)F-FDG PET/CT is superior to RECIST and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> density, demonstrating a correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers and significantly predicting PFS in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This could enable early response-adapted treatment strategies to be employed </plain></SENT>
