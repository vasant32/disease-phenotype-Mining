<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the impact of colonoscopic screening in 54 male and 98 female MSH2 mutation carriers, outcomes were compared with 94 males and 76 females who were not screened </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In males, median age to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 58 years, whereas expected was 47 years (p = 0.000), and median survival was 66 years vs 62 years (p = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
