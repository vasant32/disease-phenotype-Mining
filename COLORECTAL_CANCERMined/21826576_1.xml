<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study seeks to test the hypothesis that participants receiving telephone-based tailored education or motivational interviewing had higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening completion rates compared to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary care patients not adherent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and with no personal or family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (n = 515) were assigned by block randomization to control (n = 169), tailored education (n = 168), or motivational interview (n = 178) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 70%; attrition was 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highest screening occurred in the tailored education group (23.8%, p &lt; .02); participants had 2.2 times the odds of completing a post-intervention <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening than did the control group (AOR = 2.2, CI = 1.2-4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motivational interviewing was not associated with significant increase in post-intervention screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tailored education showed promise as a feasible strategy to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
