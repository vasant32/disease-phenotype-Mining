<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Investigators require intuitive tools to rationalize complex datasets generated by transcriptional profiling experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis methods, in which differentially expressed genes are mapped to databases of reference pathways to facilitate assessment of relative enrichment, lead investigators more effectively to biologically testable hypotheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, once a set of differentially expressed genes is isolated, pathway analysis approaches tend to ignore rich gene expression information and, moreover, do not exploit relationships between transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report the development of a new method in which both pathway topology and the magnitude of gene expression changes inform the scoring system, thereby providing a powerful filter in the enrichment of biologically relevant information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When four sample datasets were evaluated with this method, literature mining confirmed that those pathways <z:chebi fb="36" ids="30443">germane</z:chebi> to the physiological process under investigation were highlighted by our method relative to z-score overrepresentation calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, non-relevant processes were downgraded using the method described herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of expression and topological data in the calculation of a pathway regulation score (PRS) facilitated discrimination of key processes in real biological datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, by combining fold-change data for those transcripts exceeding a significance threshold, and by taking into account the potential for altered gene expression to impact upon downstream transcription, one may readily identify those pathways most relevant to pathophysiological processes </plain></SENT>
