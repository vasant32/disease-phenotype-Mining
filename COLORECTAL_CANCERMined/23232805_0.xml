<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a multicenter phase II trial on adult patients with histologically confirmed resected stage III (Dukes' C) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received oral doxifluridine (800 mg/m2/day) in 3 divided doses, or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>/tegafur (UFT) (400 mg/m2/day) in 2 divided doses for 5 days, every 7 days for 12 months with a 5-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were disease-free survival and tissue markers [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) protein levels and TP, DPD, thymidylate synthase (TS) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30839">orotate</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples and TS tandem-repeat type in blood samples] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio and disease-free survival when the model included the drug, the parameter and the interactions between them [hazard ratio (HR)=2.76; P=0.00469] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival rate was statistically significantly higher in patients with high TP/DPD ratios [median â‰¥2.63: 71.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 61.4-80.0] compared to patients with low TP/DPD ratios (&lt;2.63: 57.0%; 95% CI 46.3-66.3) (log-rank P=0.0277) following adjuvant therapy with oral fluoropyrimidines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed between the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio (cut-off value 2.0) and the disease-free survival rate in the doxifluridine group; primary endpoint (log-rank P=0.6850) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio may be a potential indicator for the individualization of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
