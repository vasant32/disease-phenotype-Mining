<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A higher circulating <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> level is inversely associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but the association with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We examined the association between the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)] concentration and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in asymptomatic average-risk participants undergoing initial screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects were comprised of 143 cases of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 143 age- and gender-matched controls with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopy among the 586 asymptomatic average-risk subjects (median age, 58 years; range, 50-73 years) who underwent first screening colonoscopy and measurement of the serum 25(OH)D(3) between December 2009 and April 2010, consistent with winter months of the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean concentration of serum 25(OH)D(3) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and control groups was 20.0 ± 11.0 ng/ml and 25.0 ± 20.0 ng/ml, respectively (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis, higher levels of 25(OH)D(3) were associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> after multivariable adjustment (highest vs. lowest quartile OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.80, P (trend) = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inverse association of circulating 25(OH)D(3) with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was stronger among the patients with proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> than that among the patients without proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (highest vs. lowest quartile OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.66, P (trend) = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that high levels of circulating <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> are associated with a decreased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and especially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> located in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
