<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> is hypothesized to play a role in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a serologic marker of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, have been positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development in some studies; however, there are limited data on the relation of CRP with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, established precursors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nested case-control investigation of CRP levels and incident colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was conducted in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ovarian Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial, a randomized trial of 154,942 individuals designed to test the efficacy of flexible sigmoidoscopy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality when performed once, and then repeated 3 to 5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum CRP levels were measured in baseline blood specimens from participants who were free of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the left-sided colorectum at the baseline screening procedure, but who were found at the subsequent screen to have at least one colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (n=356), and in a set of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-free, frequency-matched controls (n=396) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a multivariable logistic regression model that included established colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk factors, a 1-unit increase in log CRP level was associated with a 15% reduction in risk of developing colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (OR=0.85, 95% CI, 0.75-0.98, Ptrend=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association did not differ according to body size, smoking behavior, gender, use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High circulating CRP levels may be protective against colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Though at contrast with mechanistic data on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, this finding is not inconsistent with prior results on CRP and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
