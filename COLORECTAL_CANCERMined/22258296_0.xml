<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Perioperative anticancer therapy that does not impair wound healing is needed to counter the persistent proangiogenic plasma compositional changes that occur after colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polyphenon E (PolyE), a green tea derivative (main component <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>), and Siliphos (main component silibinin), from the milk thistle plant, both have antitumor effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the impact of PolyE/Siliphos (PES) on wound healing and the growth of CT-26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in several murine models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One wound healing and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Study (TS)1 assessed the impact of PES on subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, whereas TS2 assessed PES's impact on subcutaneous growth when given pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> (pneumo), sham laparotomy, or anesthesia alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TS3 determined the ability of PES to limit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mets</z:e>) after portal venous injection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the final study, laparotomy and gastrotomy wound healing were assessed several ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BALB/c mice were used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The drugs were given via drinking water (PolyE) and gavage (Siliphos), daily, for 7-9 days preprocedure and for 7-21 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> mass, number/size of hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mets</z:e>, and proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The abdominal breaking strength and energy to failure were measured postmortem as was gastric bursting pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PES significantly inhibited subcutaneous growth in the nonoperative setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PES also significantly decreased the number/size of liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mets</z:e> when given perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Abdominal wound breaking strength, energy to wound failure, and collagen content were not altered by PES; gastrotomy bursting strength also was not affected by PES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither drug alone had a significant impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PES combination inhibited subcutaneous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumor</z:mpath> growth yet did not impair wound healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>PES holds promise as a perioperative anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
