<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To report our prospective experience on the incidence and pattern of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) treated with either FOLFOX-4 or XELoda + OXaliplatin (XELOX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients scheduled to be treated with either FOLFOX or XELOX for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were prospectively monitored at baseline and followed-up during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence and severity of symptoms secondary to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> were recorded using three different types of assessment, i.e. the motor and neurosensory National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute common toxicity criteria, version 3.0 (NCI-CTCv3), the clinical version of the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> score (TNSc) and electrophysiological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients treated with either FOLFOX-4 or XELOX manifested similar incidence rates and severities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, FOLFOX-4 was associated with increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurotoxicity, compared with XELOX-treated patients (n = 64/77 versus 44/73; P = 0.002), at a very similar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> median cumulative dose during both regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the NCI-CTCv3 and TNSc demonstrated that the severity of cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi> in FOLFOX-4-treated patients is higher than in those treated with XELOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity during FOLFOX-4 therapy is similar to XELOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it seems that FOLFOX-4 is more neurotoxic than XELOX in terms of cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi>, despite comparable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> cumulative dose </plain></SENT>
