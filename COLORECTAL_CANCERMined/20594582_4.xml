<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested a more aggressive course, but this has not been verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to test the diagnostic reproducibility of previously proposed histologic criteria for serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and to analyze the clinicopathologic features and outcome that would warrant its recognition as a new subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine hundred twenty-seven consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens were used to search for cases fulfilling the criteria of serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic findings of 85 serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were compared with a matched control group of conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were encountered in 9.1% (n = 85) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Residual serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was present in 44 (51.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absence of residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> did not have any influence on the parameters studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variation between 2 Spanish and a Finnish pathologist showed moderate agreement (Îº = .5873) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with their matched controls, serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were more often accompanied by synchronous residual serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (P &lt; .0001), remote serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (P = .0035), and serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> representing partial features of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They had a less favorable 5-year survival than conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (P = .048 Breslow, Kaplan-Meier), and left-sided ones had the worst prognosis (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> is an identifiable subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; and the histopathologic differences, in addition to its less favorable prognosis, may justify its recognition as a distinct subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> warranting the search for specific clinical management strategies </plain></SENT>
