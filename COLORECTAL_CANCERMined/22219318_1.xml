<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Results from case-control studies outside the United States have been conflicted about the efficacy of colonoscopy for reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To contribute to this discourse from an alternative perspective, we analyzed high-quality surveillance data to report on recent trends in population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence rates by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were analyzed to examine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence trends from 1992 through 2008 among individuals aged â‰¥ 50 years (n = 267,072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Joinpoint regression analysis was used to quantify annual percent change in age-standardized rates by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location and disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence rates for right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> decreased annually by 2.6% (95% CI: 2.0-3.2) since 1999 in men and 2.3% (CI: 1.6-3.0) since 2000 in women, after remaining stable during the previous seven/eight years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates for left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were generally decreasing from 1992 to 2008 in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beginning in 1999/2000, substantial, almost identical annual declines occurred for late-stage disease in both the right and left colon: 3.9% (CI: 3.1-4.8) and 4.2% (CI: 3.5-4.9), respectively, in men; and 3.3% (CI: 2.5-4.1) and 3.3% (CI: 2.8-3.8) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Large declines in the incidence of right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> among individuals 50 years and older began around 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Increased colonoscopy utilization during the past decade may have contributed to a reduction in risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in both the right and left colorectum in the United States </plain></SENT>
