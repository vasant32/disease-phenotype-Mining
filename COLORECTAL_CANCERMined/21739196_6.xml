<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify miRNA expression patterns predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status and to investigate associations between microRNA (miRNA) expression and clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression profiling of 380 miRNAs was performed on 20 paired stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Artificial neural network (ANN) analysis was applied to identify miRNAs predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The validation of specific miRNAs was performed on 102 tissue specimens of varying stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ANN analysis identified three miRNAs (miR-139-5p, miR-31, and miR-17-92 cluster) predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status in stage II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression of miR-31 (p = 0.004) and miR-139-5p (p &lt; 0.001) and reduced expression of miR-143 (p = 0.016) were associated with aggressive mucinous phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of miR-10b was also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumors</z:e> (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, progressively increasing levels of miR-10b expression were observed from T1 to T4 lesions and from stage I to IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Association of specific miRNAs with clinicopathological features indicates their biological relevance and highlights the power of ANN to reliably predict clinically relevant miRNA biomarkers, which it is hoped will better stratify patients to guide adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
