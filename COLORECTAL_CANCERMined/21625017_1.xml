<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in TLRs have been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a correlation between polymorphisms of TLR4 (Asp299Gly; Thr399Ile) and TLR2 (Arg677Trp; Arg753Gln) genes and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from 60 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients from 3 major races in Malaysia (22 Malays, 20 Chinese and 18 Indians) and blood from 50 apparently healthy individuals were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control group were matched to study group by race and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms were determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotyping results showed two out of sixty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> specimens (3.3%) harbored both variant TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, DNA isolated from blood cells of 50 apparently healthy individuals harbored <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of TLR2 Arg753Gln genotyping, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the fifty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 60 tumours were of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TLR2 Arg677Trp genotyping showed a heterozygous pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this may not be a true polymorphism of the TLR2 gene as it is likely due to a variation of a duplicated ( pseudogene) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was only a low incidence (2/60; 3.3%) of TLR4 polymorphism at the Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile alleles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples harbored the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> TLR2 Arg753 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that variant TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile alleles) as well as TLR2 (Arg753Gln allele) are not associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
