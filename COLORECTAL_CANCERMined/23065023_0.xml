<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The preventive potential of vitamins (A, C and E) and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> supplementation represent an interesting opportunity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess the efficacy of a combination of these micronutrients in reducing the incidence of recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in subjects on post-polypectomy endoscopic follow-up, a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial was started in Italy in 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 411 patients were randomized to receive either an active compound (200 μg <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, 30 mg zinc, 2 mg vitamin A, 180 mg <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, 30 mg vitamin E) or a placebo daily for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of them, 330 had follow-up colonoscopy (164 in the intervention and 166 in the placebo group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4 years (range 1-15 years), 100 patients had recurrence: 38 in the intervention and 62 in the placebo arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 15-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 48.3 % in the intervention and 64.5 % in the placebo arm (HR = 0.59; log-rank P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 39 % reduction of the risk of recurrence was observed in the intervention compared to the placebo group (adjusted HR = 0.61; 95 % CI 0.41-0.92): the risk reduction was similar for small tubular (adjusted HR = 0.61; 95 % CI 0.37-0.99) and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (adjusted HR = 0.50; 95 % CI 0.24-1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a statistically significant effect of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplementation on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further clinical trials are needed to address the role of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in subgroups of subjects at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
