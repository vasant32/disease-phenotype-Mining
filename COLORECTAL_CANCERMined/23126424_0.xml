<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review documents recent major advancements in laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A PubMed search was made in order to identify recent advances in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the recent data on randomized trials in this field as well as papers of systematic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most frequently performed procedure, followed by laparoscopic bariatric surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although bile duct injuries are relatively uncommon (0.15%-0.6%), intraoperative cholangiography still plays a role in reducing the cost of litigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic bariatric surgery is the most commonly performed laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in the USA, and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the treatment of choice for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent randomized trials have demonstrated that laparoscopic gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection are safe and oncologically correct procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery has also been widely developed in hepatic, pancreatic, gynecological and urological surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently, SILS and robotic surgery have penetrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specialties of abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, evidence-based medicine has failed to show major advantages in SILS, and the disadvantage of robotic surgery is the high costs related to purchase and maintenance of technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery has become well developed in recent decades and is the choice of treatment in abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recently developed SILS techniques and robotic surgery are promising but their benefits remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
