<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second primary cancer</z:e> in women who survive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Population cohort studies suggest that the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is also high in female relatives of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histological distinction between a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath> and a serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> is not straightforward and there is probably no sharp division between hyperplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> and 'serrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adenomatous polyposis</z:e>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of the study was to define the distribution of Ki-67 and Bcl-2 protein in hyperplastic colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, controlled study was conducted in 40 women with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who had hyperplastic colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups: Group A (a control group of women without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, n = 20) and Group B (a study group of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of Ki-67 and Bcl-2 protein was assessed on the basis of quantity of immunostaining, by counting antigen positive cells, in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Student's t-test and the chi-square test were used to analyse Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistical significance was established at P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of Ki-67 stained nuclei in Groups A and B was 25.11 ± 2.07 and 41.51 ± 1.86, respectively (P &lt; 0.003), whereas the percentage of cases with cells expressing Bcl-2 in Groups A and B was 15% and 85%, respectively (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, greater proliferative activity and greater expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was found in the hyperplastic colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
