<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> was diagnosed in August 2009, an indwelling central venous port and sigmoid colon resection were implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> was a huge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> occupying the right hepatic lobe and caudate lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In consideration of the risk associated with the resection and the possibility of early recurrence, the postoperative chemotherapy was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He underwent 9 courses of bevacizumab (Bev)+FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was observed to reduce but continued to occupy the right lobe and caudate lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At this point, the surgical treatment was selected because the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> has been shrunk and there is no appearance of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to preserve residual liver function, he underwent percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization and then resection of the right lobe of the liver in February 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the Bev+FOLFOX treatment was started again after surgery as adjuvant chemotherapy, the metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> recurred in the remnant liver in August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because it was about 6 months from the first recurrence of liver resection, we decided to continue chemotherapy immediately without resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the chemotherapy was insufficient to shrink the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, which increased because it was present at 3 locations in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, partial hepatectomy at the 3 locations with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography was performed in February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since then, chemotherapy has not been performed in patients, and there is no recurrence as of March 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the guideline for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, even though chemotherapy is currently developed, the surgical procedure is recommended for patients who are responsive to local therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> recur immediately after resection, it is difficult to decide whether to re-resect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We report the case in which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free status can be observed as a result of a combination of systemic chemotherapy and local therapy </plain></SENT>
