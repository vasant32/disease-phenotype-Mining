<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: High expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>) marker CD133 has been used as a predictor for prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), suggesting that enumeration of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>, using CD133, is predictive for disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we showed recently that both CD133 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein are not downregulated during differentiation of colon <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>, pointing to an alternative reason for the prognostic value of CD133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore set out to delineate the relation between CD133 expression and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient series was studied for expression of CD133 and other <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers by microarray and quantitative PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, several common mutations were analyzed to determine the relation with CD133 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD133 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression predicted relapse-free survival in our patient series, whereas several other <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers could not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no correlation was found between expression of other <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> markers and CD133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, high CD133 expression was related to mutations in K-Ras and B-Raf, and inhibition of mutant K-Ras or downstream <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) signaling decreases CD133 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, an activated K-Ras gene expression signature could predict CD133 expression in our patient set as well as data sets of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CD133 expression is upregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that have a hyperactivated Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and is therefore related to mutations in K-Ras or B-Raf </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As mutations in either gene have been related to poor prognosis, we conclude that CD133 expression is not indicative for <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> numbers but rather related to the mutation or activity status of the Ras-Raf pathway </plain></SENT>
