<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite some controversy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27585">selenomethionine</z:chebi> (SeMet) mediated protection against colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) might be a very promising non-cytotoxic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, responsive molecular targets and underlying mechanisms of SeMet mediated chemoprevention are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to discover new targets of SeMet mediated chemoprevention in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> using proteomics analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found dietary SeMet supplementation before <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> initiation effectively suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> incidence and dysplastic lesions without any adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine chemopreventive targets of SeMet, we employed 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis based proteomics analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with SeMet apparently modulated the expression of 30 proteins with functions in major processes like <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative-stress</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as discovered through pathway analysis with Pathway studio software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We validated four proteins selected from pathway analysis including prohibitin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylase, annexin 2 and c-reactive protein by immuno-histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a known <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker was decreased by SeMet treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mice as seen by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further network analysis was done among these new four validated proteins, 8-OHdG and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These four proteins found by proteomics analysis might be considered as potential chemopreventive biomarkers of SeMet against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and can help develop and improve approaches in preventive, therapeutic and prognostic aspects </plain></SENT>
