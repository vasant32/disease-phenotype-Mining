<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Molecular Epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> study is a population-based, case-control study in northern Israel of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and age-, sex-, clinic-, and ethnic group-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term use of bisphosphonates before diagnosis was assessed in a subset of 933 pairs of postmenopausal female patients and controls, enrolled in Clalit Health Services, using computerized pharmacy records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The use of bisphosphonates for more than 1 year before diagnosis, but not for less than 1 year, was associated with a significantly reduced relative risk (RR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This association remained statistically significant after adjustment in a model for vegetable consumption, sports activity, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, body mass index, and use of low-dose aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, and postmenopausal hormones (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant use of bisphosphonates and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> did not further reduce the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of oral bisphosphonates for more than 1 year was associated with a 59% relative reduction in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, similar to the recently reported association of this drug class with reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
