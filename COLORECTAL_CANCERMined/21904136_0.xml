<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few consider the possibility that multiple pathways are synchronously active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that multiple synchronous carcinogenic pathways would result in an enhanced neoplastic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study took place during outpatient screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patient were included who were undergoing colonoscopies for average and familial risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> were evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> or DNA mismatch repair dysfunction, and serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of CpG island hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with 1 or 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were compared with those with &gt;2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> more than 10-mm diameter (advanced) as the end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1408 patients: 524 at average risk (41%) and 884 (59%) with a family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> were found in 47.7% of the average-risk patients and in 45.9% of patients with a family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates were 33.8% and 30.4%, and serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rates were 24.8% and 23.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were more advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with &gt;2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> than in those with 1 or 2 (36.2% vs 13.6%, P &lt; .002), as well as in the subgroup of patients having average-risk screening (50% vs 11.1%, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Having a combination of &gt;2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the same colon increased the risk of finding advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> alone (serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 12.7%; &gt;2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 17.7%; both, 27.1%; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were not subclassified by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Coexistence of serrated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> reflects a colon prone to advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and potentially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
