<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Quantitative, descriptive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An urban comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center in northeastern Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: 50 patients undergoing first-line palliative chemo-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were asked to fill out an institution-developed questionnaire assessing personal, emotional, physical, and social data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Psychological, physical, and social characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The most frequently reported side effects of chemotherapy were asthenia, loss of taste, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, about 54% of patients were unable to work during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy administration resulted in severe or moderate impediment of activities of daily living in 74% of the patients and negatively influenced their financial situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>About 25% of the patients were reluctant to share the news of their disease with their coworkers; however, most revealed their diagnosis to friends and family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority (62%) of patients expected help from family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nurses provided emotional support to a much lesser extent than patients' immediate relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (80%) needed to express their feelings by talking, but only about 30% considered a nurse to be the preferred person with whom to discuss their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed at an advanced stage require considerably more emotional, informative, and instrumental support from nurses, doctors, family, other patients, and priests than was anticipated by the authors.Implications for Nursing: Extending routine history taking via the addition of questions to the proposed questionnaire may help to better recognize a particular patient's situation and unique needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An increasingly patient-focused approach could improve the individual nursing care in this region of Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, a multidisciplinary team would be required to meet the needs of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
