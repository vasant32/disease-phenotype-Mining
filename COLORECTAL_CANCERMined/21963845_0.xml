<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although detailed knowledge exists regarding Wnt-regulated protein-coding genes, much less is known about the possible involvement of non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we used TaqMan Array MicroRNA Cards, capable of detecting 664 unique human microRNAs (miRNAs), to describe changes of the miRNA transcriptome following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF4 activity in DLD1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most miRNAs appeared to respond independent of host gene regulation and proximal TCF4 chromatin occupancy as inferred from expression microarray and ChIP-chip data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A module of miRNAs induced by abrogated Wnt signaling in vitro was downregulated in two independent series of human primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (n=76) relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent mucosa (n=34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several of these miRNAs (miR-145, miR-126, miR-30e-3p and miR-139-5p) markedly inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell growth in vitro when ectopically expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using an integrative approach of proteomics and expression microarrays, we found numerous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> and proteins to be affected by ectopic miR-30e-3p levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This included HELZ and PIK3C2A that were directly repressed by several miRNA binding sites as confirmed by luciferase reporter assays in combination with mutational analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated downregulation of PIK3C2A, but not HELZ, was sufficient on its own to restrict <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our study demonstrates that multiple miRNAs are upregulated as a consequence of forced attenuation of Wnt signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, and some of these miRNAs inhibit cell growth with concomitant suppression of several growth-stimulatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes </plain></SENT>
