<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A large number of gene expression profiling (GEP) studies on prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been performed, but no reliable gene signature for prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic enrichment tools are a powerful approach to identify biological processes in high-throughput data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have for the first time collected the results from the 23 so far published independent GEP studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these 23 studies, 1475 unique, mapped genes were identified, from which 124 (8.4%) were reported in at least two studies, with 54 of them showing consisting direction in expression change between the single studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these data, we attempted to overcome the lack of reproducibility observed in the genes reported in individual GEP studies by carrying out a pathway-based enrichment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used up to ten tools for overrepresentation analysis of Gene Ontology (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) categories or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in each of the three gene lists (1475, 124 and 54 genes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This strategy, based on testing multiple tools, allowed us to identify the oxidative phosphorylation chain and the extracellular matrix receptor interaction categories, as well as a general category related to cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as the only significantly and consistently overrepresented pathways in the three gene lists, which were reported by several enrichment tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our pathway-based enrichment analysis of 23 independent gene expression profiling studies on prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> identified significantly and consistently overrepresented prognostic categories for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These overrepresented categories have been functionally clearly related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e>, and deserve further investigation </plain></SENT>
