<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-Raf and MEK1/2 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation, but their ultimate success is likely to be limited by acquired drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines harbouring mutations in B-Raf or K-Ras to model acquired resistance to the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selumetinib-resistant cells were refractory to other MEK1/2 inhibitors in cell proliferation assays and exhibited a marked increase in MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity and cyclin D1 abundance when assessed in the absence of inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was driven by a common mechanism in which resistant cells exhibited an intrachromosomal amplification of their respective driving oncogene, B-Raf V600E or K-RasG13D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the increased signal flux from Raf to MEK1/2, resistant cells maintained in drug actually exhibited the same level of ERK1/2 activity as parental cells, indicating that the pathway is remodelled by feedback controls to reinstate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of ERK1/2 signalling that is required and sufficient to maintain proliferation in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide important new insights into how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells adapt to new therapeutics and highlight the importance of homoeostatic control mechanisms in the Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
