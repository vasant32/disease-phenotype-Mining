<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the present study analyzed polymorphisms of eNOS gene and their impact on the prognosis for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and forty-four consecutive patients with surgically resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNA was extracted from fresh colorectal tissue and 2 polymorphisms of eNOS gene (eNOS T786C and eNOS G894T) determined using a real-time PCR genotyping assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 eNOS gene polymorphisms were successfully amplified, and the frequencies of each genotype are as follows [T786C: TT (82.2%), TC (16.9%), CC (0.9%); G894T: GG (82.0%), GT (17.3%), TT (0.7%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate survival analysis including stage, age, site of disease, and CEA level showed that these polymorphisms were not associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the clinicopathologic parameters, CEA level and TNM stage were significant prognostic factors in a Cox model for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The eNOS gene polymorphisms investigated in this study were not found to be an independent prognostic marker for Korean patients with surgically resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are warranted to clarify the role of the eNOS gene polymorphisms as a prognostic biomarker for colorectal patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
