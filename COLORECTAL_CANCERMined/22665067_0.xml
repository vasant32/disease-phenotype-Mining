<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously found that Brca1 deficiency activates the Akt oncogenic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of Brca1 was highly correlated with increased activated Akt in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, activation of Akt1 was involved in Brca1-deficiency-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Defective homologous recombination (HR) is thought to be a major contributor to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in Brca1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Akt1 promotes chromosome instability in Brca1-deficent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA breaks in Brca1-deficent cells are aberrantly joined into complex chromosome rearrangements by a process dependent on Akt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of Akt1 increases HR in Brca1-mutant cells, which is rescued by expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, but not mutant Akt1 with deletion of Brca1-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, activated Akt1 in Brca1-deficient cells impairs Chk1 nuclear localization and subsequently disrupts interaction of Chk1 and Rad51 leading to HR defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Brca1 deficiency might activate Akt1 contributing to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> through regulation of the Chk1-Rad51 signaling </plain></SENT>
