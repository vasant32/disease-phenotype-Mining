<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 48 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who developed pneumatosis or intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> were found by searching a radiology database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 24 patients (13 women and 11 men; mean age, 61 years; range, 39-83 years) receiving molecular targeted therapy without any confounding factors for pneumatosis or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial and follow-up CT scans were evaluated by two radiologists; medical records were reviewed to note clinical features, management, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen (70.8%) patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 10) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 5) were the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>; bevacizumab (n = 14) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38940">sunitinib</z:chebi> (n = 6) were the most common associated drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imaging findings included intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (20 sites in 18 patients), pneumatosis (n = 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> (n = 8), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> (n = 7), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> formation (n = 7), and fluid collections (six collections in five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (62.5%) patients were treated conservatively, seven (29.2%) underwent surgery, and two (8.3%) underwent percutaneous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular targeted therapy was discontinued in 22 of 24 patients; findings resolved in 19 patients, remained stable in one, and worsened in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both instances where the drug was continued, the abnormality worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Findings recurred in three of four patients in whom the drug was restarted after initial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiologists should be aware of intestinal complications associated with molecular targeted therapy, including pneumatosis, bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most patients can be treated conservatively after discontinuation of molecular targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Continuing or restarting molecular targeted therapy can cause worsening or recurrent pneumatosis or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
