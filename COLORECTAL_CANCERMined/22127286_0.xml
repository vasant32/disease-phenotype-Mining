<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether circulating insulin or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels are associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few prospective studies have examined this question, and only one study had repeated measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk using the subsample of women in the Women's Health Initiative study whose fasting blood samples, collected at baseline and during follow-up, were analysed for insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in both baseline and time-dependent covariates analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 4902 non-diabetic women with baseline fasting serum insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values, 81 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were identified over 12 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk: multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) comparing the highest (â‰¥99.5 mg dl(-1)) with the lowest tertile (&lt;89.5 mg dl(-1)): 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-3.15 and 2.25, 95% CI: 1.12-4.51, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin and homeostasis model assessment were not associated with risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of repeated measurements supported the baseline results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that elevated serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels may be a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
