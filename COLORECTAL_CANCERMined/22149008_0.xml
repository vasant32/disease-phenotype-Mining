<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> might be capable to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This activity is linked in part to its anti-inflammatory properties mediated through modulation of immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was the aim of the study to evaluate the role of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> in the immune balance between peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and those of HT-29 and RKO human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytokine production was evaluated following incubation of the two types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells without and with three concentrations of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A concentration-dependent inhibition of TNFα and IFNγ secretion by PBMC was observed only after their stimulation by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction of the anti-inflammatory IL-1ra and IL-10 production was observed using higher <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> concentrations only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We presume that by changing the equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in favor of anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> may reduce the inflammatory process with a consequent suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progress </plain></SENT>
