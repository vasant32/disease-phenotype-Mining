<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three (83%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> biweekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven (17%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We collected data on 23 patients for the first cycle and on 41 patients for the first two cycles, for a total of 105 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>Nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> was graded using Common Toxicity Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients maintained a 7-day postinfusion diary of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetics</z:chebi> and steroids on day 1 of each cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with data collected for both cycles, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> was the same during cycles one and two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine percent used rescue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetics</z:chebi> in cycle one, and 34% did so in cycle two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight percent of men reported no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> in cycle one compared with 33% of women; for cycle two, these figures were 67% and 36%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent of patients reported no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> in cycle one, and 85% did so in cycle two </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was well controlled and evenly divided between grades 1 and 2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> were intrinsic to the patient and mostly unrelated to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetics</z:chebi> used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Sex and previous experience with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>emesis</z:hpo> should be considered for efficient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> management </plain></SENT>
