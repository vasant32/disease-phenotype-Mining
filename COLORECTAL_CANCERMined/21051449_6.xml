<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have investigated the association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of prediagnostic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use was therefore examined in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific survival among cases from the Seattle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Family Registry (Seattle Colon CFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a follow-up study that included incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from the Seattle Colon CFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were aged 20-74, diagnosed from 1997 to 2002, and were identified using the population-based Puget Sound SEER registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed information on history of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use, including type, recency and duration, was collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up for mortality was completed through linkages to the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the relationship between prediagnostic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific mortality among cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis was associated with an ~20% lower rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality after diagnosis compared with never use (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This relationship appeared to be duration dependent, with longer reported use prior to diagnosis associated with lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality among cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most pronounced reductions in mortality were observed among cases diagnosed with proximal disease (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.82), whereas no association was observed between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use prior to diagnosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-specific mortality among cases diagnosed with distal or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rectal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that regular use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> prior to diagnosis is associated with improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survival, particularly among cases diagnosed with proximal disease and in longer term <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
