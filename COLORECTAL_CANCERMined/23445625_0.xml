<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) for the preoperative staging of patients with colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> has increased steadily over the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PET/CT on the preoperative staging and clinical management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 2010 and February 2012, 64 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were evaluated with both PET/CT scans and conventional preoperative imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively recorded the medical reports of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PET/CT findings were compared with conventional imaging studies and the rate of over-staging or down-staging and changes in clinical management were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation of the PET/CT with the conventional imaging was compared by a kappa agreement coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in the accuracy for N and T staging were assessed by χ2 and related-samples marginal homogeneity tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine (60.9%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and 25 (39.1%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on PET/CT, additional lesions were found in 6 (9.4%) of the patients: hilar and paratracheal lesions in 4 patients, hepatic in 1 and supraclavicular in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In four of six patients, detailed imaging studies or biopsies revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hepatic and supraclavicular involvement was confirmed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the false positivity rate of PET/CT was 6.25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on the additional PET/CT, 2 (3.2%) patients had a change in surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A chemotherapy regimen was administered to the patient with a 1.5 cm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> near the right hepatic vein; for another patient with an identified supraclavicular lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, a simultaneous excision was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of PET/CT for preoperative staging did not impact disease management for 96.8% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results of our study conclude that PET/CT should not be routinely used for primary staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>More studies are required for identifying the subgroup of patients who might benefit from a PET/CT in their initial staging </plain></SENT>
