<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients receiving chemotherapy alone were compared to patients receiving surgery and chemotherapy in a matched-pair analysis with the following criteria: UICC stage, grading, and date of initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with liver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> underwent resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 20 cases, complete resection was achieved (median survival, 67 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incomplete resection and preoperatively elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels are independent risk factors for reduced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> had the worst prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection significantly increased survival compared to chemotherapy alone in matched-pair analysis (65 vs. 30 months, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete resection and elevated CEA levels are predictors of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Matched-paired analysis confirmed that surgical resection in combination with chemotherapy appears to be superior to chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
