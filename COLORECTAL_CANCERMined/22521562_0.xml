<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) protein participates in the DNA damage response in many cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Germline mutations in CHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2+1G&gt;A and I157T) have been impaired serine/threonine kinase activity and associated with a range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hospital-based case-control study aimed to investigate whether CHEK2 1100delC, IVS2+1G&gt;A and I157T mutations play an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 210 CRC cases and 446 cancer-free controls were genotyped for CHEK2 mutations by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and allele specific-polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We did not find the CHEK2 1100delC, IVS2+1G&gt;A and I157T mutations in any of the Turkish subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our result demonstrate for the first time that CHEK2 1100delC, IVS2+1G&gt;A and I157T mutations have not been agenetic susceptibility factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data suggest that genotyping of CHEK2 mutations in clinical settings in the Turkish population should not be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, independent studies are need to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in patients of different ethnic origins </plain></SENT>
