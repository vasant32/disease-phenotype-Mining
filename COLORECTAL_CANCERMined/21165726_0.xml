<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: African Americans participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening less often than whites, while disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is younger, and incidence and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: POC items for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were administered to 158 African Americans, the majority of whom were female (75.9%) and were not employed (85.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate four factors reflecting the POC sub-domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Support of the factor validity of the POC with internal consistency of standardized alpha for the four factors was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression showed predictive validity in predicting current screening stage for two of the four sub-domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the application of the POC to prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening intention among African Americans </plain></SENT>
