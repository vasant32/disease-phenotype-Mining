<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Up-regulation of lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin X (Cat X) is associated with disorders of the immune system and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, while its role in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is less understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhanced secretion of pro-Cat X was observed in malignant processes, and therefore, the level of total serum Cat X rather than the active enzyme may better reflect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were included in a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected prior to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using ELISA, the values of total Cat X were measured in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups of healthy persons (n=77), patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n=77) and patients with non-neoplastic findings (n=77) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences between the group of colorectal patients and the groups of healthy persons, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> patients and patients with non-malignant findings could not be shown (p=0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, higher levels of total Cat X significantly correlated to shorter overall survival (HR=2.08, 95% CI:1.07-4.05, p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total serum Cat X could be a useful prognostic indicator for determining survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased serum levels of total Cat X may reflect more aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> and suggest the involvement of Cat X in processes involved in later stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
