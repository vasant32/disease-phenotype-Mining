<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of Th17 cells in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and development still remains unclear, despite the fact that it has been established in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We first analyzed Th17 cells and Treg cells using flow cytometry in the circulation of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA) and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients and healthy controls, and the frequency of Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 and treated by IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β in different concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then detected cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-23 or TGF-β by ELISA in sera and supernatants from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues cultured ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was found that the percentage of Th17 and Treg cells increased in the circulation of both CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients; the increase of Th17 cells in the circulation occurred in early stages, whereas the increase of Treg cells in the circulation and the increase of Th17 cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues occurred in advanced stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subsequent cytokine profiling showed that, along <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression, IL-1β, IL-17A and IL-23 underwent a similar change, while IL-6 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> exhibited an opposite change, with Th17 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, high levels of TGF-β and IL-17A were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues rather than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The in vitro experiment further demonstrated that IL-1β, IL-6 or TGF-β modulated Th17 cell expansion in PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a unique change of Th17 cells, which is regulated possibly by IL-1β, IL-6 and TGF-β in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
