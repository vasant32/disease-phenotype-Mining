<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that YWK-II/APLP2 functions as a novel G(0)-protein-coupled receptor for MÃ¼llerian inhibiting substance (MIS) in cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, factors regulating the stability and turnover of YWK-II/APLP2 have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present evidence that human leukocyte antigen-B-associated transcript 3 (Bat3), an important regulator involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, can interact with YWK-II/APLP2 and enhance its stability by reducing its ubiquitylation and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of different Bat3 domain deletion constructs with YWK-II/APLP2 reveals that the proline-rich domain of Bat3 is required for its binding to YWK-II/APLP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we find that the protein levels of YWK-II/APLP2 could be enhanced by nuclear export of Bat3 under apoptotic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also find elevated levels of Bat3 and YWK-II/APLP2 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with a positive correlation between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results have revealed a previously undefined mechanism regulating cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and suggest that aberrant enhancement of YWK-II/APLP2 by nuclear export of Bat3 may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development by inhibiting cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
