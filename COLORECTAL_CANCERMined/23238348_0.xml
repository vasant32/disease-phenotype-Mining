<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Hispanic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) rates historically have been lower than for non-Hispanic Whites in the United States and in Florida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to understand <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> trends in Florida Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> diagnosed among Florida residents between 1989 and 2006 were accessed from the Florida <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data System (FCDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases were analyzed by Hispanic and non-Hispanic White ethnic identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Hispanic Origin Identification Algorithm was applied to the FCDS data to identify Hispanic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> site and histology data were organized according to SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Joinpoint regression was used to generate incidence trends by stage and subsite location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence were higher for Florida Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic Whites since the mid 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a consistent significant increase in the incidence of distant stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Hispanics (annual percent change (APC) of 1.26 and 0.90 in males and females), whereas rates in non-Hispanics decreased significantly during the same time period (APC -1.36 and -1.28, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were found in distant-stage right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, local stage incidence rate increased for both non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics, whereas the incidence rate for regional stage decreased for both racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Trends for distant-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are increasing among Florida Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is a particular public health concern given that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> for which screening modalities exist and could imply a concomitant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related mortality among Florida Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in Hispanics are documented at the state level, relative to non-Hispanic Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Screening programs targeting the Florida Hispanic population are warranted </plain></SENT>
