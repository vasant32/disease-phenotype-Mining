<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who had more than one colonoscopy performed for the same indication within a three year time frame at our tertiary care referral hospital between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2010 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included repeat colonoscopies performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening/surveillance, poor bowel preparation, suspected complications from the index procedure, and incomplete initial procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was new endoscopic finding that led to an endoscopic therapeutic intervention or any change in clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical parameters including age, sex, race, interval between procedures, indication of the procedure, presenting symptoms, severity of symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e>, duration between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and when the procedure was performed, change in endoscopist, withdrawal time, location of colonic lesions and improvement of quality of bowel preparation were analyzed using bivariate analysis and logistic regression analysis to examine correlation with this primary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 19  772 colonoscopies performed during the above mentioned period, 947 colonoscopies (4.79%) were repeat colonoscopies performed within 3 years from the index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of these repeat colonoscopies, 139 patient pairs met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of repeat colonoscopies were for lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> (88.4%), change in bowel habits (6.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 139 eligible patient pairs of colonoscopies, only repeat colonoscopies that were done for lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> produced endoscopic findings that led to a change in management [25 out of 123 (20.33%) and 2 out of 7 (28.57%), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When looking at only recurrent lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> cases, new endoscopic findings included 8 previously undetected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoid</z:e> lesions (6.5%), 7 actively <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> lesions requiring endoscopic intervention, which included 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> arterio-venous malformations (2.43%), 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (1.6%), and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal hemorrhoids</z:e> (1.6%), 5 previously undetected tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> [4 were smaller than 1 cm (4.9%) and 1 was larger than 1 cm (0.8%)], 3 radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (2.43%), 1 rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (0.8%), and 1 previously undetected right sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 new endoscopic findings, 18 (72%) were found when repeat colonoscopy was done within the first year after the index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings were 1 rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, 3 radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 4 new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoid</z:e> lesions, 3 previously undetected tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and 7 actively <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> lesions requiring endoscopic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters analyzed, only the interval between procedures less than one year was associated with higher likelihood of finding a clinically significant change in repeat colonoscopy (odds ratios of interval between procedures of 1-2 year and 2-3 year compared to 0-1 year were 0.09; 95%CI 0.01-0.74, P = 0.025 and 0.26; 95%CI 0.09-0.72, P = 0.010 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 139 colonoscopy pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is clinical value of repeating a colonoscopy for recurrent lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, especially within the first year after the index procedure </plain></SENT>
