<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After translocation into the nucleus, it acts as a transcription factor resulting in the expression of β-catenin target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These resemble most of the hallmarks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> except eternal life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The central mediator of this hallmark is hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hTERT gene is regulated, besides others, by the transcription factor c-Myc and, thus, indirectly via β-catenin as c-Myc is a β-catenin target gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression patterns of hTERT and β-catenin, but not c-Myc are overlapping, probably because c-Myc is not only regulated by β-catenin, but also by many other transcription factors and pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we argued that hTERT might be a direct target gene of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show evidence that β-catenin directly regulates the expression of the hTERT gene </plain></SENT>
