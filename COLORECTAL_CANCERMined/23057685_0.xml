<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous structure-activity relationship studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> analogues revealed that 4-benzoylbutyrate had comparable in vitro effects to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> when used to treat HT29 and HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify potential mechanisms associated with the antitumorigenic effects of 4-benzoylbutyrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37054">3-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> and 4-benzoylbutyrate were also investigated for their effects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4 acetylation in HT29 and HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biological effects of these analogues on HT29 cells were further investigated using quantitative proteomics to determine the proteins potentially involved in their apoptotic and antiproliferative effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37054">3-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> had minimal to no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, proliferation or HDAC activity, this analogue was used to identify differentially expressed proteins that were potentially specific to the apoptotic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and/or 4-benzoylbutyrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> treatment inhibited HDAC activity and induced H4 acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4-Benzoylbutyrate inhibited HDAC activity but failed to enhance H4 acetylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteomic analysis revealed 20 proteins whose levels were similarly altered by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and 4-benzoylbutyrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proteins that showed common patterns of differential regulation in the presence of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> or 4-benzoylbutyrate included c-Myc transcriptional targets, proteins involved in ER homeostasis, signal transduction pathways and cell energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although an additional 23 proteins were altered by 4-benzoylbutyrate uniquely, further work is required to understand the mechanisms involved in its apoptotic effects </plain></SENT>
