<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 174 consecutive patients undergoing CTC as part of staging or primary investigation where a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prone unenhanced and portal phase enhanced supine series with air or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> distension were acquired using 4- or 16-slice CT (Toshiba) and read by 2D +/- 3D formats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Synchronous lesions were classified according to American College of Radiology's (ACR) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Segmental gold standard was flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy within 1 year and/or histology of colonic resection supplemented by follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients without gold standard were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated on a per <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>, per patient and per segment basis and discrepancies analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Direct comparable data were available for 764/990 colonic segments from 165 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 41 (C2-C4) synchronous lesions on "gold standard", 33 were correctly identified on virtual colonoscopy (VC), overall per <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> sensitivity was 80.5%, with detection rates of 20/24 C3 (83.3%) and 3/3 C4 (100%) with per patient and per segment specificity of 95.4% and 99.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTC is an accurate technique to assess for significant synchronous lesions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and is applicable for total pre-operative colonic visualisation </plain></SENT>
