<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, compliance with current screening methods remains poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify an accurate blood-based gene expression signature for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression in peripheral blood samples from 216 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and 187 controls was investigated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first performed a microarray analysis to select candidate genes that were significantly differentially expressed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was then used to evaluate the expression of selected genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A gene expression signature was identified using a training set (n = 200) and then validated using an independent test set (n = 160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified an 18-gene signature that discriminated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from controls with 92% accuracy, 91% sensitivity and 92% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The signature performance was further validated in the independent test set with 86% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 88% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.94 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The signature was shown to be enriched in genes related to immune functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study identified an 18-gene signature that accurately discriminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from controls in peripheral blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results prompt the further development of blood-based gene expression biomarkers for the diagnosis and early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
