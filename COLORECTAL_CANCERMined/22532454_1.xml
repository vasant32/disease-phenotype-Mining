<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We critically examine a candidate serum protein pattern for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) with respect to reproducibility, sample handling, and disease specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004991" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign colon tumors</z:e> and healthy individuals, were obtained at two collection sites and analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS on 8 days, over a period of 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spectra were subjected to multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissues from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selected mass peaks were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using an elaborate experimental design we developed a multivariate classifier that correctly classified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and control serum measured on an independent day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The classifier did not discriminate between samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004991" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign colon tumors</z:e>, and, secondly, did not correctly classify serum from an independent collection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> discriminatory mass peaks were identified as high abundant plasma proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue profiling provided support of increased proteolytic activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Critical verification did not justify advancing the identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> serum protein pattern into clinical validation without improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that proteomics biomarker research could benefit if the presented, or a similar, verification scheme was more commonly employed in explorative biomarker studies </plain></SENT>
