<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the chemopreventive effect of green tea on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> was studied in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DMH group received subcutaneous injections of DMH (30 mg kg(-1) body weight) once a week for 30 weeks, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group received the vehicle of DMH, and the DMH + green tea group received DMH simultaneously with 1% green tea as their sole source of drinking fluid throughout the experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the DMH group treated with green tea, significant reductions in gene overexpressions of colonic nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and NF-κB immunostaining indicates the anti-inflammatory effect of green tea in attenuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the anti-angiogenic and anti-invasiveness effects of green tea were revealed as reductions of both vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-7 mRNA expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were confirmed by the significant reduction of serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α, C-reactive protein levels, inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> incidence, and nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> survival rate and colonic architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that green tea exerts a potent chemopreventive effect on colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> possibly due to the inhibition of NF-κB </plain></SENT>
