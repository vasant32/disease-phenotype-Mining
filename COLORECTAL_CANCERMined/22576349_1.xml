<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab mainly acts by inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells; however, in the human host, its IgG1 backbone may offer additional antitumor activity that includes FcÎ³Rs-mediated antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, cross priming, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific T-cell-mediated immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms are still under active investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At this purpose, we have performed an immunologic investigation in advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients enrolled in an ongoing phase II trial aimed to test the toxicity and the biological and antitumor activity of a novel biochemotherapy regimen combining polychemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi>, irinotecan, levofolinic acid, and fluorouracil with cetuximab and with subcutaneous low-dose metronomic aldesleukin (GILFICet regimen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the first 20 patients enrolled in the GILFICet trial were collected at baseline and after 6 treatment cycles and examined for immune-phenotype change by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo>-specific T-cell lines were also generated ex vivo from these samples and subsequently characterized for immune phenotype, functional activity, and antigen specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a treatment-related increase of circulating dendritic cells, natural killer cells, central memory T cells, and activated T cells with a T-helper 1 (Th1)-cytotoxic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ex-vivo characterization of antigen-specific T cells derived from the treated patients revealed a significant increase in proliferating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors specific for carcinoembryonic antigen and thymidylate synthase derivative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On these basis, we concluded that the GILFICet regimen exerts substantial immune-modulating activity that significantly affects <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigen-specific T-cell compartment with potential antitumor activity </plain></SENT>
