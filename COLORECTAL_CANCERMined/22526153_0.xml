<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphisms has been analyzed in several published studies, but mixed findings have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this study was to integrate previous results and explore whether the polymorphism of hOGG1 is associated with susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cbmdisc were searched for studies on the relationship of hOGG1 SNPs and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligible articles were included for data extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the frequency of hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphisms between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the distribution of SNP was mainly performed using Review Manager 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 4,174 cases and 6,196 controls from 12 studies were included for this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, stratified by ethnicity or population source, no significant associations between the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk were found for Cys/Cys allele (OR = 1.146; 95 % CI: 0.978-1.342, P = 0.091), Cys/Cys + Cys/Ser versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.045; 95 % CI: 0.975-1.121, P = 0.213) Cys/Cys Versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.243; 95 % CI: 0.979-1.578, P = 0.074) and Cys/Cys versus Cys/Ser + Ser/Ser (OR = 1.198; 95 % CI: 0.959-1.496, P = 0.111) in a recessive model and (OR = 1.494; 95 % CI: 1.023-2.181, P = 0.038) in a homozygote contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, if apart from sensitivity analysis, there was some evidence to indicate that significantly increased risks were found among European plus American subjects, who are mostly Caucasian (OR = 1.444; 95 % CI: 1.017-2.05 Cys/Cys vs. Ser/Cys + Ser/Ser; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analyses, we also did not found any association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and certain populations and smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that there is no robust association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the limitation of meta-analysis, this finding demands further investigation </plain></SENT>
