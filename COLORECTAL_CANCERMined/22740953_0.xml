<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epigenetic abnormalities, in cooperation with genetic alterations, are capable of causing aberrant gene function that results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined mutations and methylation status in 164 CRCs to determine whether the combination of genetic and epigenetic alterations may be used to classify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients in relation to their clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation analyses for the KRAS and PIK3CA genes were performed using direct sequencing, and the MethyLight method was used to determine the methylation status of BNIP3, p16 and hMLH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of the KRAS mutation with methylation status did not have any association with clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, patients with the PIK3CA mutation and/or high methylation (2 or 3 methylated genes) had significantly poorer outcomes in disease-specific survival (DSS) compared with those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PIK3CA and 0 or 1 methylated genes (P=0.0059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, multivariate analysis revealed that the PIK3CA mutation and/or a high level of methylation predicts a poor DSS independently of clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a combination of genetic and epigenetic alterations is a potent biomarker for predicting the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
