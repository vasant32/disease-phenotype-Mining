<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this matched case-control study was to explore circulating novel adipocytokines, such as serum visfatin, omentin-1 and vaspin levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Serum visfatin, omentin-1, and vaspin levels were measured in 69 subjects (39 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the controls, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had significantly higher circulating omentin-1 (203.23 vs 9.12ng/ml, p&lt;0.0001) visfatin (4.03 vs 2.01ng/ml, p&lt;0.0001) and vaspin (0.54 vs 0.31ng/ml, p=0.015) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for covariates (age and body mass index), patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had significantly higher serum omentin-1 (p&lt;0.0001), visfatin (p&lt;0.0001), and vaspin (p=0.040) levels than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results did not change when age and waist-to-hip ratio were considered as covariates in the general linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed higher levels of omentin-1, visfatin, and vaspin in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, independent of measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, suggest that these adipocytokines may have a potential role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> through mechanisms other than the indirect mechanisms that are active in the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
