<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The feasibility of an alternating regimen of BIBF 1120, a potent, oral, triple angiokinase inhibitor, and afatinib (BIBW 2992), a potent ErbB family blocker, was explored in patients with advanced pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received repeated courses of alternating 7-day treatment periods, first with BIBF 1120 250 mg twice daily and then afatinib 50 mg once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the objective response rate; the incidence/severity of adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetics (PK) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six patients (≥4 prior lines, most anti-VEGF and/or -EGFR pretreated) received BIBF 1120 and afatinib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No objective responses were observed; the best response was stable disease in 20 patients (43.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (15.2%) remained progression-free for ≥16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 1.9 months; median overall survival was 5.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent drug-related AEs were diarrhoea (80.4%), asthenia (47.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (43.5%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (41.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PK assessments did not show obvious alterations for either drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Weekly alternating administration of BIBF 1120 and afatinib is feasible; however, its efficacy was limited in this highly palliative patient population </plain></SENT>
