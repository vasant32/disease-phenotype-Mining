<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of IGF-1 gene splicing and the role of local expression manifested by IGF-1 mRNA variants in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have not been extensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse the expression of IGF-1 mRNA isoforms [A, B, C, P1 (class I) and P2 (class II)], as well as the protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and control samples isolated from 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of Ki-67 was also analysed and clinical data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> coding for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> splicing isoforms of IGF-1 was observed in every tissue sample studied, with a significantly lower expression noted in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as compared to the control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic expression of IGF-1 protein was found in 50% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and in ~40% of the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues; however, no significant quantitative inter-group differences were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of the IGF-1 gene in the 2 groups of tissues was controlled by the P1 and P2 promoters in a similar manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were detected in the expression of the IGF-1 A and B isoforms; however, their expression was significantly higher compared to that of isoform C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between the expression of Ki-67 mRNA in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and control tissue even though the expression of the Ki-67 protein was higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to the control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 protein expression was associated with the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was found between the local production of total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and isoform A and the expression of Ki-67 mRNA, although only in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples, the local expression of the total IGF-1 mRNA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> splicing isoforms of IGF-1 mRNA decreased as compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues, although however, with conservation of both gene promoter activities and with the continued principal splicing IGF-1 mRNA isoforms </plain></SENT>
