<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Some patients under close colonoscopic surveillance still develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, thus suggesting the overlook of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> by endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AFI detects colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> as a clear magenta, therefore the efficacy of AFI is expected to improve the detection ability of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of AFI in detecting colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study enrolled 88 patients who underwent colonoscopy at Asahikawa Medical University and Kushiro Medical Association Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A randomly selected colonoscopist first observed the sigmoid colon and rectum with conventional high resolution endosopy (HRE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then the colonoscopist changed the mode to AFI and handed to the scope to another colonoscopist who knew no information about the HRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the second colonoscopist observed the sigmoid colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each colonoscopist separately recorded the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection rate, miss rate and procedural time were assessed in prospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The detection rate of flat and depressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, but not elevated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, by AFI is significantly higher than that by HRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In less-experienced endoscopists, AFI dramatically increased the detection rate (30.3%) and reduced miss rate (0%) of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in comparison to those of HRE (7.7%, 50.0%), but not for experienced endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The procedural time of HRE was significantly shorter than that of AFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AFI increased the detection rate and reduced the miss rate of flat and depressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These advantages of AFI were limited to less-experienced endoscopists because experienced endoscopists exhibited a substantially high detection rate for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with HRE </plain></SENT>
