<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimization of surface chemistry and spotting conditions are crucial parameters to enhance antibodies' immobilization efficiency and to maintain their biological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the implementation of an antibody microarray for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional microstructured glass slides were functionalized with three different aminated molecules ((3-aminopropyl)dimethylethoxysilane (APDMES), Jeffamine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi>) varying in their chain length, their <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> density, and their hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physicochemical properties of the resulting surfaces were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody immobilization efficiency through physical interaction was studied as a function of surface properties as well as a function of the immobilization conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that surface energy, steric hindrance, and pH of spotting buffer have great effects on protein immobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under optimal conditions, biological activities of four immobilized antitumor marker antibodies were evaluated in multiplex immunoassay for the detection of the corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> functionalized surface displayed the highest binding capacity and allowed to retain maximal biological activity of the four tested antibody/antigen systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, we successfully demonstrated the application of amino-based surface modification for antibody microarrays to efficiently detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
