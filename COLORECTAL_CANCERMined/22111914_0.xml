<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the benefits of the integration of the Laparoscopy-assisted surgery, fast-track perioperative treatment, and even with the Xelox chemotherapy, are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the three treatments integration is defined as "Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment Model" for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and this model extends the benefits to the whole treatment process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of the study is to explore the feasibility of "Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment" model in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The trial is a prospective randomized controlled study with 2 Ã— 2 balanced factorial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients eligible for the study will be randomized to 4 groups: (I) Laparoscopic surgery with fast track perioperative treatment and Xelox chemotherapy; (II) Open surgery with fast track perioperative treatment and Xelox chemotherapy; (III) Laparoscopic surgery with conventional perioperative treatment and mFolfox6 chemotherapy; (IV) Open surgery with conventional perioperative treatment and mFolfox6 chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of this study is the hospital stays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints are the quality of life, chemotherapy related adverse events, surgical complications and hospitalization costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Totally, 340 patients will be enrolled with 85 patients in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study initiates a new treatment model "Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment" for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and will provide feasibility evidence on the new model "Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment" for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
