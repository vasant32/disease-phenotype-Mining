<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several factors determine overall outcome and possible local recurrence after curative surgery for rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical performance is usually believed to be the most pertinent factor, followed by adjuvant oncological treatment and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clones are assumed to differ in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> and potential of causing local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate if genetic alterations in primary rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> are predictive of local recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A large clinical database with linked bio-bank allowed for careful matching of two patient groups (R0) resected for rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One group had developed early, isolated local recurrences and the other group seemed cured after 93Â months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> was analysed with array-CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) including 55,000 genomic probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> in both groups displayed previously reported and well-recognised DNA aberrations in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant copy number gains were confirmed in the 4q31.1-31.22 region in DNA from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with subsequent local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two affected genes in this region code for products with high relevance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology (p53 regulation, cell cycle activity, transcription) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DNA from rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> displayed well-known aberrations as described for colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with no obvious prediction of local rectal recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gains in the 4q31.1-31.22 DNA region are highly potential for local recurrence despite R0 resection to be confirmed in larger patient materials </plain></SENT>
