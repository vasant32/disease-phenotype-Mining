<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a controlled simulation experiment, 12 primary care providers (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) used prototypes of the current and redesigned <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening reminder in a within-subject comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measurements were based on a usability survey, workload assessment instrument, and workflow integration survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also collected qualitative data on both designs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Design enhancements to the VHA's existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening clinical reminder positively impacted aspects of usability and workflow integration but not workload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The qualitative analysis revealed broad support across participants for the design enhancements with specific suggestions for improving the reminder further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the value of a human-computer interaction evaluation in informing the redesign of information tools to foster uptake, integration into workflow, and use in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
