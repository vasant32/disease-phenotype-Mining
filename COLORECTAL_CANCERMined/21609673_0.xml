<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The setting up and the progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CCR) follow a sequence of events that are spatio-temporally rigorously orchestrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The failures that specifically target the signaling pathways responsible for the cancerization of the colorectal mucosa have been well described and among these it seems that a dysregulation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is involved in the triggering of near 90 % of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been also described that several risk factors linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> (feeding, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, etc.) predispose individuals to CCR but no rational explanations were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that, since it is implicated in the control of the insulin pathway among other actions, the nutritional sensor O-GlcNAcylation may be the element linking these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> to CCR </plain></SENT>
