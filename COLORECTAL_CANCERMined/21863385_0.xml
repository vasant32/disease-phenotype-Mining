<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no study about serum Nup88 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, we investigated the level of serum Nup88 protein and its relationships with clinicopathological variables in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration of Nup88 protein was determined by a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 118 pre-operative serum samples, 66 post-operative and 96 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the patients, the levels of CEA (n = 91) and CA19-9 (n = 87) in the pre-operative serum were measured, and DNA sequencing was performed in 12 CRCs and 2 samples from non-cancerous colon tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the same patients, the level of pre-operative serum Nup88 was significantly higher than that of post-operative Nup88 (P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the level of pre-operative Nup88 was positively related to the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion (P = 0.002) and advanced stage (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of pre-operative Nup88 in the left colon tended to be higher than that in the right colon and the rectum (P = 0.063) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing results showed that there were two single nucleotide polymorphisms, distributed in exon 6 (NM_002532.3:c.1044G&gt;A (ACG-ACA, Thr → Thr) and exon 10 (NM_002532.3:c.1389A&gt;T, CCA-CCT, Pro → Pro) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum Nup88 might be a candidate for a new biomarker implicated in the development and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
