<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the last decade, many studies have compared laparoscopic surgery with open colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to present the advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic and open colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, focusing on the postoperative care of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight consecutive patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the colon</z:e> and rectum, surgically treated, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 2 groups: Group A patients (n = 48) underwent laparoscopic colectomy, and Group B patients (n = 40) were treated with an open procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For postoperative care of the patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp>, median hospital stay, overall cost, and complications between the 2 groups were studied and statistically compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic colectomy was associated with a shorter average hospital stay, fewer complications, earlier start of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet, and better control of postoperative pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the cost of surgical instruments used in laparoscopic operation is higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery, despite its higher cost, seems to add significant advantages in the postoperative recovery of patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
