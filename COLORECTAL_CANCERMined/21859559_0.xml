<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preclinical and clinical studies were conducted to further investigate the biologic and clinical activities of this herbal medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To ensure standardization and maintain interbatch reliability of PHY906, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to establish a "chemical fingerprint" of PHY906 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo preclinical studies using the murine Colon 39 tumor model showed that PHY906 protected against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> associated with irinotecan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of PHY906, mice were able to tolerate otherwise lethal doses of irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly improved antitumor activity and overall survival were observed in animals treated with the combination of irinotecan and PHY906 versus irinotecan alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of PHY906 with irinotecan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), and leucovorin (LV) also resulted in at least additive antitumor activity with no increased host toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these in vivo studies, a phase I multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation, cross-over study of PHY906 as a modulator of the weekly, bolus regimen of irinotecan, 5-FU, and LV (IFL) in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specific objectives of this clinical trial were to determine the safety and tolerability of PHY906 when administered concomitantly with the bolus, weekly IFL regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with PHY906 did not alter the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU, irinotecan, or the irinotecan metabolite SN-38 </plain></SENT>
