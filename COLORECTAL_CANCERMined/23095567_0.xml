<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We took <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over 75 year-old patients, affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, treated with colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients has been divided into two groups: laparotomy group and laparoscopy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data concerning patients, i.e., age, sex, BMI, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, comorbidities, were collected with data concerning the operation (surgical time, conversion percentage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative outcomes - i.e., gas evacuation, bowel movements, solid and liquid feeding, need to ICU, complications, re-surgery, hospitalization and type of discharge, mortality - were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 145 patients are included: laparotomy 80 and laparoscopy 51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two groups are homogeneous for age, sex, BMI, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical times are the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Need to Intesive Care Unit (ICU) is lower in laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gas evacuation and bowel movements are earlier in laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Liquid and solid diet is earlier in laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization was earlier after laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Discharge at home is more frequent in laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Major and minor complications are lower in laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Post-operative mortality is lower in laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy improves over 75 year-old patients' outcomes, after elective surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgery trauma, anaesthesia, nutritional and hemodynamic alterations, are factors that break the old patients' fragile physiologic balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Less traumatic surgery improves old patients' outcomes </plain></SENT>
