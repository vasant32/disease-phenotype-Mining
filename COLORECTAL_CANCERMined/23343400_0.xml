<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>African American patients (n = 102) were surveyed about their own screening beliefs; third-year resident physicians (n = 29) were asked what they perceived their patients believed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The perceptual maps showed significant differences between the patients' and physicians' perceptions of barriers, facilitators, and beliefs about screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physicians believed logistical lifestyle issues were the greatest screening barriers for their patients whereas fears of complications, pain, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were the most important barriers perceived by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physicians also underestimated patients' understanding of the benefits and importance of screening, doctors' recommendations, and beliefs that faith in God could facilitate screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physicians and patients perceived a doctor's recommendation for screening was an important facilitator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Better understanding of patient perceptions can be used to improve doctor-patient communication and to improve medical resident training by incorporating specific messages tailored for use with African American patients </plain></SENT>
