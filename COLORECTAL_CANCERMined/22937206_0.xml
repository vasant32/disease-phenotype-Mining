<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated 23 variants of the Lgr5 gene in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of stage III and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data were compared to results of immunohistochemical Lgr5 expression analysis and to prognostic clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences were found comparing germline and somatic Lgr5 genotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, but additional Lgr5 gene alterations could be demonstrated in lymph node and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant negative correlation was seen between Lgr5 allelic variation and Lgr5 protein expression (p=0.0394), which mainly can be attributed to the negative influence of non-coding Lgr5 gene variations on Lgr5 protein expression (p=0.0166) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lgr5 gene variants could be found more frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> of stage III patients with increased time to recurrence, in distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of patients with better survival and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> of patients with poorer survival compared to patients with Lgr5 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> in primary and metastatic tissues, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the analytic power of these prognostic data was low due to small sample size in the investigated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data indicate that Lgr5 allelic variation affect Lgr5 protein expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The somatic Lgr5 genotype seems to be relatively stable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, but becomes vulnerable during the metastatic process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This instability has possibly prognostic importance, which has to be further evaluated by large cohort studies </plain></SENT>
