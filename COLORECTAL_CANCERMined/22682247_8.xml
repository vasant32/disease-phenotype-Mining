<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is incompletely understood how the Axin1 complex exerts its Wnt-regulated function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine the mechanism of Wnt signaling under endogenous levels of the Axin1 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that β-catenin is not only phosphorylated inside the Axin1 complex, but also ubiquinated and degraded via the proteasome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> within an intact Axin1 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In disagreement with current views, we find neither a disassembly of the complex nor an inhibition of phosphorylation of Axin1-bound β-catenin upon Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar observations are made in primary intestinal epithelium and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines carrying activating Wnt pathway mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wnt signaling suppresses β-catenin ubiquitination normally occurring within the complex, leading to complex saturation by accumulated phospho-β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, newly synthesized β-catenin can accumulate in a free cytosolic form and engage nuclear TCF transcription factors </plain></SENT>
