<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated differences in the molecular architecture of the metastatic lesion compared to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, however, systemic analysis of the alterations within the activated protein signaling network has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using laser capture microdissection, protein microarray technology, and a unique specimen collection of 34 matched primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e>, the quantitative measurement of the total and activated/phosphorylated levels of 86 key signaling proteins was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of the EGFR-PDGFR-cKIT network, in addition to PI3K/AKT pathway, was found uniquely activated in the hepatic metastatic lesions compared to the matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If validated in larger study sets, these findings may have potential clinical relevance since many of these activated signaling proteins are current targets for molecularly targeted therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings could lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> specific molecular therapies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
