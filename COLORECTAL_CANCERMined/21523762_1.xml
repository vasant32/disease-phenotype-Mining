<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Training primary care physicians (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) to perform colonoscopy may improve screening rates among underserved high-risk populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors compared colonoscopy screening rates and computed adjusted odds ratios for colonoscopy-eligible patients of trained African American <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> (study group) versus untrained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> (comparison group), before and after initiating colonoscopy training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> colonoscopies were performed at a licensed ambulatory surgery center with specialist standby support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrospective chart review was conducted on 200 consecutive, established outpatients aged â‰¥50 years at each of 12 PCP offices (7 trained African American <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> and 5 untrained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>, practicing in the same geographic region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 1244 study group and 923 comparison group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Post-training colonoscopy rates in both groups were higher than pretraining rates: 48.3% versus 9.3% in the study group, 29.6% versus 9.8% in the comparison group (both P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>African American patients in the study group showed a &gt;5-fold increase (8.9% pretraining vs 52.8% post-training), with no change among whites (18.2% vs 25.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Corresponding pretraining and post-training rates among comparison patients were 10.4%% and 38.7%, respectively, among African Americans (P &lt; .001), and 13.3% versus 13.2%, respectively, among whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for demographics, duration since becoming the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>'s patient, and health insurance, the study group had a 66% higher likelihood of colonoscopy in the post-training period (odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.13), and African Americans had a 5-fold increased likelihood of colonoscopy relative to whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colonoscopy-trained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> may help reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> disparities </plain></SENT>
