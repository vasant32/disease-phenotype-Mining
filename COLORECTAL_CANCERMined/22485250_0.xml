<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown a correlation between elisidepsin sensitivity and expression of the ErbB3 receptor in a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the effect of elisidepsin on the ErbB3 pathway, characterizing the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the ErbB (HER) family of receptors and their main downstream signaling effectors, such as Akt and MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we observed a downregulation of ErbB3 upon elisidepsin treatment that correlates with a reduction in the Akt phosphorylation levels in the most sensitive cell lines, whereas ErbB3 levels are not affected in the less sensitive ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, we observed that the basal levels of ErbB3 protein expression show a significant correlation with cell viability response against elisidepsin treatment in 14 different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we analyzed the combination of elisidepsin with different chemotherapeutics agents, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, paclitaxel and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi>, in a panel of different breast (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-435, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 and MCF7), lung (HOP62, DV90 and A549) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines (DLD1 and HT29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IC50 values for the different drugs were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed a synergistic effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested with any chemotherapeutic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the two in vitro elisidepsin-resistant cell lines (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231 and HOP62) presented a synergistic effect in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and paclitaxel, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide a rationale for further development of these combinations in an ongoing clinical trial </plain></SENT>
