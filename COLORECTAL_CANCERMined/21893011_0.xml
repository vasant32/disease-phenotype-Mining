<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The higher sensitivity of CT has resulted in a number of unexpected abdominal findings of varying importance; an issue that was previously studied in relation to CT colonography, but not in relation to staging CT with intravenous contrast in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the number and significance of such unexpected findings on staging CTs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprises a retrospective analysis of 247 consecutive patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery at Roskilde Hospital, Denmark, in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A preoperative abdominal staging CT was performed in 245 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CT scans and patient records were reviewed by the authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unexpected CT findings were classified as being of high, moderate or low clinical importance according to whether they required treatment relatively promptly, later or did not require treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 114 patients (47%) had unexpected findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the 137 findings (14%) or 8% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were considered to be of high importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to the adrenal glands, 2% primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022665" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">kidney tumours</z:e> and 1% gynaecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty per cent of the patients had findings of moderate importance and 29% findings of low importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Staging CT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients showed nearly 8% of unexpected abdominal findings of high clinical importance requiring relatively prompt treatment </plain></SENT>
