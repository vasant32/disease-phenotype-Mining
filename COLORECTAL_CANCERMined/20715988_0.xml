<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study a functional anti-human CD133 MAb 6B6 was obtained, and the specificity of this MAb was verified by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This MAb effectively recognized the CD133 molecule expressed on a series of malignant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry staining showed the CD133 was expressed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that MAb 6B6 could inhibit the proliferation of Caco-2 cells that were derived from a human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This functional anti-human CD133 MAb provides a valuable tool for further study of biological functions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell that expressed CD133 </plain></SENT>
