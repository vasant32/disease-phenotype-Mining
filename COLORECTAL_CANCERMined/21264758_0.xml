<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Despite the encouraging results of chemotherapy in patients affected by incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), surgical resection of a primitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is still a common approach worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of prognostic factors related to short survival (&lt;6 months) may allow excluding from resective surgery those who may not benefit from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 15 variables in a population of 71 patients undergoing nonemergency palliative primary resections of incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including patients' demographics and clinical/histopathological characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No variables were related to perioperative mortality (8.5% overall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis revealed that older age (â‰¥80 years) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> to more than 25% of the lymph nodes were associated with survival (4 and 6 months, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mucoid <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> therefore tends to be associated with the prognosis (P = 0.070) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An elderly age tends to be a contraindication to an elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection in patients affected by incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Massive lymph node involvement and mucoid <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> should also be considered before planning major colonic surgery </plain></SENT>
