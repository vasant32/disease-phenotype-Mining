<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 patients were included for surgery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0345904" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LCC">malignant liver tumors</z:e> (mean age 61 years (19-80); male n = 35, female n = 15), suffering from <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> (n = 15), colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver-metastasis</z:e> (n = 28), <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> (n = 2) or other malign liver lesions (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative CE-CT (n = 38), CE-MRI (n = 23) or PET-CT (n = 8) confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumor</z:mpath> manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before undergoing surgery, intraoperative conventional (IOUS) as well as CE-IOUS were performed by one experienced examiner in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases using multifrequency linear probes (6-9 MHz, 6-15 MHz; LOGIQ E9; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CE-IOUS was performed after bolus injection of 5 ml up to 15 ml SonoVue(Â®) (Bracco Imaging SpA, Milan, Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digitally stored images of CE-IOUS were compared with fundamental B-Scan and preoperative imaging (CE-CT, CE-MRI and PET-<z:chebi fb="33" ids="124991">CET</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 28 of 50 patients (56%), additional lesions were found using CE-IOUS (mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size 8 mm, range 4-12 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a change of surgical strategy or the intraoperative application of RFA in 27 patients (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modification of therapy due to additionally found liver lesions was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparing conventional IOUS and CE-IOUS, 14 additional lesions in 10 patients were seen by CE-IOUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions seen in B-scan could also be detected with CE-IOUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: This is the first study using contrast-enhanced ultrasound with high resolution linear probes for intraoperative detection of malignant liver lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to preoperative imaging and also conventional IOUS more than 50% additional lesions were found leading to therapeutic consequences of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A recently started prospective study has to show whether these changes in the surgical or interventional therapy will influence morbidity, mortality and especially the recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
