<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diet was assessed through a modified food frequency questionnaire that included supplement use and a meat-specific module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases reported intakes for the year before diagnosis, whereas controls reported intakes for the year before interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi> iron intake was calculated using a new <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> database developed by the US National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, there were no significant associations between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron or total iron intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dietary iron intake was inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among women (OR Q5 vs. Q1=0.45; 95% CI=0.22-0.92), but not among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Supplemental iron intake of more than 18 mg/day versus none was positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence (OR=2.31; 95% CI=1.48-3.59; P-trend&lt;0.001), an effect that was observed in both men (OR=2.56; 95% CI=1.30-5.05) and women (OR=2.46; 95% CI=1.34-4.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that consumption of more than 18 mg/day of supplemental iron may increase risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
