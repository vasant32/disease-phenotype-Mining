<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in an academic setting showed that many lesions can be managed accurately on the basis of their endoscopic image (optical diagnosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective study to assess the accuracy of optical diagnosis of small colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in a nonacademic setting (the DISCOUNT trial) by using high-resolution endoscopy (HRE) and narrow-band imaging (NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During colonoscopy, 1 of 3 nonacademic endoscopists characterized small lesions and declared whether this was done with low or high confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases of high confidence, the endoscopists decided whether lesions should be removed and discarded or whether they could be left in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A surveillance interval was then recommended on-site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 215 patients in the study, 108 were found to have 281 small lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these lesions, 231 were characterized with high confidence by using HRE or NBI; the level of corresponding sensitivity was 77.0% (95% confidence interval, 68.4-83.8), and specificity was 78.8% (95% confidence interval, 70.6-85.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these lesions, 164 were assigned for removal, and 67 were assigned to remain in situ, including 9 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 54 patients, a surveillance interval could be recommended on-site that was in line with Dutch guidelines for 44 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even though many lesions were characterized by HRE or NBI with high confidence, optical diagnosis in a nonacademic setting proved to be disappointing, with a sensitivity of 77.0% and a specificity of 78.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Many lesions were accurately assigned to be removed or remain in situ, although few <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were assigned to remain in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, 19% of on-site recommendations for a surveillance interval proved to be inaccurate </plain></SENT>
