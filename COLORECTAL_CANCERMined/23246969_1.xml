<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are mediated by alterations in transcriptional networks, resulting in a disturbed balance between the activity of oncogenes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcription factors have the capacity to regulate global transcriptional profiles, and are consequently often found to be deregulated in their expression and function during <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sex-determining region Y-related high-mobility-group box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) is a member of the group C subfamily of the SOX transcription factors and has a critical role during embryogenesis, where its expression is widespread and controls the development of numerous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SOX4 expression is elevated in a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, suggesting a fundamental role in the development of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, deregulated expression of this developmental factor has been correlated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proliferation, cell survival, inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> through the induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in a limited subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, SOX4 has also been reported to act as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These opposing roles suggest that the outcome of SOX4 activation depends on the cellular context and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, SOX4 expression, transcriptional activity and target gene specificity can be controlled by signaling pathways, including the transforming growth factor-Î² and the WNT pathway, as well as at the post-translational level through regulation of protein stability and interaction with specific cofactors, such as TCF, syntenin-1 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide an overview of our current knowledge concerning the role of SOX4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and progression.Oncogene advance online publication, 17 December 2012; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.506 </plain></SENT>
