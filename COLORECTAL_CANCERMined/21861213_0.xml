<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a trend toward nonsurgical management of patients with nonobstructing metastatic (stage IV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), although some will eventually undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who were managed with an intact <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An institutional review board (IRB)-approved database was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presenting with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 2000 to 2008 were identified and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 255 patients identified, 112 were taken directly to the operating room for either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection or colostomy/bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 143 patients, 97 were managed without developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>-related symptoms, and 14 (9.8%) developed significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>-related symptoms necessitating operative or endoscopic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who developed symptoms, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and/or irinotecan was used among 71.4% of patients, and bevacizumab in 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients in the series underwent elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection after receiving chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No independent predictors for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>-related symptoms could be identified after controlling for age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, number of metastatic sites, and type of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 34 months for those who underwent elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection after chemotherapy, and 16 months for those who failed chemotherapy and developed symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> without an initial indication for surgery, incidence of obstruction or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> after initiating chemotherapy was low (9.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>-related complications could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival was favorable among the highly selected cohort of patients who underwent elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
