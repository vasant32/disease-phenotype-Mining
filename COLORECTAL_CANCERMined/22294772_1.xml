<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of APC defects observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue is the result of selective growth advantage of cells with loss-of-function mutations at that locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, mutations may also arise due to inherent sequence instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and base excision repair (BER) also contribute to colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and may compound such instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To avoid the effect of clonal selective advantage imparted by APC mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, we assessed in vitro APC mutation frequency in cell lines of lymphoid lineage to investigate the influence of defective MMR and BER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In DNA repair proficient cells, we observed substantially greater inherent sequence instability in APC gene coding sequences compared to reference sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, however, this difference was abrogated in MMR defective lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found greater mutation frequency at exonic DNA sequences outwith the APC region in cells defective for either MMR or BER defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The underlying propensity for mutation at the APC gene is intriguing, while the greater frequency of mutation in cells defective for DNA repair has relevance to understanding events leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
