<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date the role of resistin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is far from being elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum resistin levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in relation to known risk/protective factors including anthropometric, metabolic, inflammatory parameters as well as lifestyle individual characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 40 CRC patients and 40 controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein (CRP) and resistin levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Metabolic Syndrome</z:e> (MS) was defined according to the harmonized definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resistin levels were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients than in controls (p=0.028) and gradually increased with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage progression (p=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high resistin level was statistically significant determinant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and lifestyle parameters (p=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resistin showed a strong association with CRP levels (p â‰¤ 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In stepwise regression analysis CRP remained the only independent predictor of both resistin levels (p=0.001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results clarify the nature of the association between resistin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk suggesting that the proinflammatory state of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, rather than the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> itself or its link with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and MS, may govern this association </plain></SENT>
