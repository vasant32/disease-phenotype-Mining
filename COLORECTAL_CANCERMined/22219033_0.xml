<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> samples were prospectively collected from patients post-surgery at the 3rd Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of tissue arrays was used to analyze the samples and genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) was detected by fluorescence multiplex polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 146 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples were collected, including 84 men (57.7%) and 62 women (42.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age of the study population was 60.8 ± 10.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notch1 and Notch2 gene expression correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology type and degree of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, Jagged 1 (JAG1) and hairy enhancer of split 1 gene expression correlated with the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delta-like 1 gene expression varied significantly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between gene expression and MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 138 patients, 134 (91.8%) participated in on-site visits, and the average follow-up time was 42.3 ± 13.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During this period, 86 patients (71.6%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 1 year post-surgery, 93% of patients were alive, 74% of patients lived for 3 years, and 67% of patients lived for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The log-rank test was used to perform univariate analysis, and the COX proportional hazards model was used for the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Based on these analyses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> prognosis correlated with the TNM stage, pathological type, microsatellite status as well as Notch2 and JAG1 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients expressing high levels of Notch2 and JAG1 presented with a significantly better prognosis compared to patients expressing negative or weak levels of Notch2 and JAG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of genes associated with the Notch signaling pathway correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology and the degree of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, Notch2 and JAG1 expression levels correlated with survival; however, the underlying mechanism for these correlations remains unclear </plain></SENT>
