<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The neurotrophic receptor tropomyosin related kinase (TrkB) is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> and certain human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports indicate TrkB may participate in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether TrkB expression is associated with the clinical outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients and whether TrkB induces EMT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TrkB and E-cadherin expression in surgical tissue samples and clinicopathological data from 102 CRC patients were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biological role of TrkB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was analyzed using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference against TrkB in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line SW480 to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and the correlation between TrkB and E-cadherin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with high TrkB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in clinical samples had a significantly poorer prognosis relative to those with low TrkB levels (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TrkB was inversely correlated with E-cadherin at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, cell proliferation (p = 0.02), migration (p &lt; 0.001), and invasion (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly inhibited by TrkB knockdown while the anoikis rate increased in TrkB siRNA-transfected cells compared to control siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, E-cadherin expression in TrkB siRNA-transfected cells was higher than in control cells and vimentin was lower conversely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High TrkB expression is associated with poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and enhanced malignant potential in terms of proliferation, migration, invasion, and anoikis inhibition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate TrkB could induce EMT and play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
