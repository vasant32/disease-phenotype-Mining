<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism for the impairment of ICG retention in patients undergoing chemotherapy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to elucidate the mechanism for impairment of ICG retention in patients with CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinicopathologic data of 98 patients with CLM undergoing hepatectomy were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The archived nontumoral liver parenchyma bearing no CLM were immunostained with CD34 antibody to determine the sinusoidal capillarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 98 patients, 80 received preoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome</z:e> (SOS) occurred in 39 patients (39.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of SOS in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy was significantly higher compared to those receiving non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SOS was independently associated with abnormal ICG retention rate at 15 minutes (ICG-R15) (odds ratio 3.45, 95% confidence interval 1.31-9.04, P=0.012) and CD 34 overexpression (odds ratio 18.76, 95% confidence interval 4.58-76.81, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ICG-R15 correlated with CD34 expression within the nontumoral liver parenchyma (r=0.707, P&lt;0.001) and severity of SOS (r=0.423, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD34 positive areas were likely situated at the peripheral area of SOS, and both SOS score and number of cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy significantly correlated with CD34 expression (r=0.629, P&lt;0.001 and r=0.522, P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the deterioration of hepatic functional reserve due to SOS is associated with sinusoidal capillarization, indicated by CD34 overexpression within nontumoral liver parenchyma adjacent to SOS </plain></SENT>
