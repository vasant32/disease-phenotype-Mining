<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Cochrane Library review recommends self-administered low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) for 2-3 weeks following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the light of the recent guidelines from the ACPGBI and NICE, we undertook a National Questionnaire Survey to assess current thrombo-prophylaxis practice among colorectal surgeons in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A 10-item questionnaire was designed to enquire into the current management strategy of postoperative thrombo-prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postal questionnaire survey was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 490 active consultant members of the ACPGBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 490 questionnaires sent, 259 (52.8%) were returned fully completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (100%) respondents reported the routine use of thrombo-prophylaxis, with 243 (93.8%) following departmental guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined medical and mechanical prophylaxis was used by 247 (95.40%) respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A small number - 12 (4.6%) - used medical prophylaxis only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LMWH was the preferred medical-prophylactic agent of 243 (93.8%) repondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority, 176 (68%), started thrombo-prophylaxis on admission and stopped it at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one (27.4%) respondents recommended thrombo-prophylaxis after hospital discharge for an average duration of 4-6 weeks, preferring graduated compression stockings followed by LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The National Questionnaire Survey on thrombo-prophylaxis demonstrated a high degree of concordance with the available guidelines, except for thrombo-prophylaxis to be continued postoperatively for a period of 28 days/4 weeks </plain></SENT>
