<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) cleaves the proheparin-binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor (proHB-EGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And soluble HB-EGF activates EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel, the carboxy-terminal fragment of proHB-EGF (HB-EGF-CTF) translocates into the inner nuclear membrane, and subsequently exerts on the regulation of cell proliferation by binding nuclear promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> zinc finger (PLZF) protein, a transcriptional repressor, thereby causing its nuclear export </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the inhibition of HB-EGF-CTF nuclear translocation may be a new strategy in preventing cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbor-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) was treated to activate ADAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine-thousand <z:chebi fb="29" ids="37577">chemical compounds</z:chebi> were screened for their efficacies in blocking the binding of HB-EGF-CTF to promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> zinc finger (PLZF) with Alphascreen system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The obtained candidates were then used to block the binding of HB-EGF-CTF to PLZF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, HT29 and HCT116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was investigated with a growth curve assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intracellular localization, and association between HB-EGF-CTF and PLZF, was assessed with immunofluorescent staining, and immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of obtained candidates on EGFR phosphorylation and on nuclear translocation of HB-EGF-CTF and export of PLZF during the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type1 receptor (AT1R) knockdown were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">Telmisartan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> were found to be potential candidates </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> did not inhibit <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced EGFR phosphorylation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9434">telmisartan</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, inhibited <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-induced nuclear translocation of HB-EGF-CTF after knockdown of AT1R </plain></SENT>
