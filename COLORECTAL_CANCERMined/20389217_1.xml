<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> have been reported to occur more often after liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this is also true for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims were 1) to compare the observed rate of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in a post-liver transplantation cohort with incidence data from the general Dutch population, and 2) to stratify for patients with and without primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp>, because primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> is well established as a risk factor for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the medical records of liver transplantation patients who had a liver transplantation in our center between 1986 and 2007 with a follow-up of at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence data from the general population were retrieved from the Dutch Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were defined as standardized incidence ratio and incidence rate per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-four patients (58% men; mean age at liver transplantation, 46.6 y) were included in the 1986 to 2007 period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bowel investigation before liver transplantation had been performed in 73% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 5.1 years (range, 0.25-20 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the end of follow-up was 52 years (SD, 13 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was diagnosed in four patients (1%) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall standardized incidence ratio for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in post-liver transplant recipients was 2.16 (95% CI: 0.81-5.76) compared with the general population and 1.26 (95% CI: 0.31-5.03) for nonprimary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> post-liver transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the incidence of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is not increased in non-primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> post-liver transplantation compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A more intense colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> surveillance program based on this result remains controversial in nonprimary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> post-liver transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
