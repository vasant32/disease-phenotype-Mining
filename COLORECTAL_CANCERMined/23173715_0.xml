<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In recent years, many algorithms have been developed for network-based analysis of differential gene expression in complex diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These algorithms use protein-protein interaction (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) networks as an integrative framework and identify subnetworks that are coordinately dysregulated in the phenotype of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MOTIVATION: While such dysregulated subnetworks have demonstrated significant improvement over individual gene markers for classifying phenotype, the current state-of-the-art in dysregulated subnetwork discovery is almost exclusively limited to binary phenotype classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, many clinical applications require identification of molecular markers for multiple classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APPROACH: We consider the problem of discovering groups of genes whose expression signatures can discriminate multiple phenotype classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We consider two alternate formulations of this problem (i) an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-vs-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> approach that aims to discover subnetworks distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classes, (ii) a one-vs-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> approach that aims to discover subnetworks distinguishing each class from the rest of the classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the one-vs-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> formulation, we develop a set-cover based algorithm, which aims to identify groups of genes such that at least one gene in the group exhibits differential expression in the target class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We test the proposed algorithms in the context of predicting stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the set-cover based algorithm identifying "stage-specific" subnetworks outperforms the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-vs-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> approaches in classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also investigate the merits of utilizing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> networks in the search for multiple markers, and show that, with correct parameter settings, network-guided search improves performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that assessing statistical significance when selecting features greatly improves classification performance </plain></SENT>
