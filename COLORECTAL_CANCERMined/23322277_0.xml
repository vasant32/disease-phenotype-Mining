<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Due to ethnic, genetic and environmental factors, the clinical and molecular characteristics of Turkish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients are different from those of Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the relevant alterations of gene expression associated with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients and to identify specific biomarkers that could provide novel therapeutic molecular targets in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression profiles of 114 different genes were evaluated using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> PCR arrays in 39 tumors and 20 surgical margin tissue samples from 39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients diagnosed at less than 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression levels of IMPDH2, CK20, MAP3K8 and EIF5A were strongly up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highly significant expression ratios of CK20, MAP3K8 and EIF5A observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> of patients predicted recurrence (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of IMPDH2, CK20, MAP3K8 and EIF5A was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of patients with short median survival (log-rank p value &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was also significantly increased in patients with low expression of the EIF5A gene compared with those who exhibited high expression of this gene (log-rank p value &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that high CK20, MAP3K8 and EIF5A expression levels were significant prognostic factors for poor overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies and validations are required; these genes may provide novel therapeutic molecular targets for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment, as well as new directions for the development of anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
