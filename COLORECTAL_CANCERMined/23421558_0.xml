<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A dendritic cell-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccine has recently received Food and Drug Administration approval in the USA based on its ability to prolong the survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-mediated immunosuppressive mechanisms might represent an obstacle to optimal performance of this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that monocytes from the blood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients can fully mature to dendritic cells only after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have tested the hypothesis that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-driven monocytes correspond to the recently described subset of CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) immunosuppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients were studied before and 1 month after prostatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postsurgical patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were also included for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis was applied to define CD14(-) HLA-DR(low) CD33(+) CD11b(+) (myeloid) and CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) (monocytic) suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interferon-γ release was used to assess the immunocompetence of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, the percentage of CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) cells was several-fold higher compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was not the case for CD14(-) HLA-DR(low) CD33(+) CD11b(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, postsurgical normalization of CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) cells only occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the interferon-γ response of T lymphocytes to phorbolmyristate <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-ionomycin was higher compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, but it was further increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> ablation only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The direct link between CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) increase and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> suggests a distinguishing immunosuppressive profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This observation supports the principle that the appropriate setting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> vaccine therapy is a minimal disease status </plain></SENT>
