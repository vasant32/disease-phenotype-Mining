<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of theories have been proposed to explain MPM, but none have been proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A key risk factor appears to be family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 43-year-old male with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancers</z:e> who was first admitted to the hospital for an undifferentiated pleomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>/pleomorphic malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_409'>fibrous histiocytoma</z:mpath> (pG2T2bN0Mx stage III) of the right scapula in May 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resections in situ due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the period of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, computed tomography (CT) revealed a 10x10-cm enhancing soft mass of the ascending colon, which was diagnosed as mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a pathological report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data showed elevated serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, 20.0 μg/l; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, 0.0-10.0 μg/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Certain family members of the patient had been diagnosed with endometrial, colon and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the family had a smoking history or presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Family history may be a key risk factor for MPM and HNPCC, the detailed molecular mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case report with an investigation of family history may improve the clinical recognition of HNPCC and MPM </plain></SENT>
