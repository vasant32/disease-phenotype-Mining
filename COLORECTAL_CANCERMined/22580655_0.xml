<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Forty-six patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent surgical resection were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was determined by the Danenberg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> profile method based on laser-captured micro-dissection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TS protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression tended to relate TS protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was not found in overall survival between the TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> high group and low group regardless of performing adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival in the TS protein negative group was significantly higher than that in positive group in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and the patients without adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed TS protein expression was as an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TS protein expression tends to be related TS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and is an independent prognostic factor in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
