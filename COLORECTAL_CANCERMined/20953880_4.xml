<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is increasingly being performed worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although learning standardized procedures under the supervision of an experienced surgeon may be effective, there is currently no information on the learning curve under such circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This single-center study aimed to evaluate the learning curve for laparoscopic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> of one surgical fellow with no previous experience with laparoscopic colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed for 108 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between July 2007 and October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed by a single fellow with no prior experience with laparoscopic colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The learning effect was evaluated by dividing the patients into two groups: group 1 consisted of the first 50 patients and group 2 included the last 58 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Short-term outcomes were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: More complex procedures were performed more frequently in group 2 than in group 1 (p=0.0086) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly greater percentage of cases was completed by the trainee in group 2 than in group 1 (91% vs. 68%; p=0.0030) and were performed independent of the supervisor (81% vs. 38%; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures after the 65th case were completed by the trainee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean number of lymph nodes harvested (15 vs. 16), conversion to open surgery (0% vs. 2%), and postoperative complications (4% vs. 12%) did not differ significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no intraoperative complications or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Operating time for sigmoidectomy/high anterior resection reached a steady state after 35 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that training in laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> under the supervision of an experienced surgeon can be performed safely without jeopardizing the short-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More complex procedures were performed successfully by the trainee during the later period, even though he was more independent of the supervisor </plain></SENT>
