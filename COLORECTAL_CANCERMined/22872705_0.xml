<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sanger sequencing (SS) of PCR products is still the most frequent method to test <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for KRAS mutations in routine practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An audit of SS on 1720 routine cases was carried out, taking into account age, gender, specimen type (resection vs biopsies), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> site (primary vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage, neoplastic cells abundance (&gt;30% vs &lt;30%) and fixation type (buffered formalin vs simple formalin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 50 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) patients correlations between SS findings and response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The tests were informative in 1691 cases (98.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected in 671 cases (39.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in mutation rates were observed with respect to age (p=0.2), gender (p=0.2), specimen type (p=0.3) and formalin fixation (p=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, KRAS mutant rate was higher in metastatic tissue (50% vs 39%, p=0.02), in samples with over 30% of neoplastic cells (43.4% vs 26.6%, p=0.02) and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> tested in stage IV (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RR of SS KRAS WT patients was 26% (one complete and 12 partial responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease control rate (objective responses plus stable disease) was 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 4.4 months and median OS was 10.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pathological criteria that make SS a more robust method for KRAS testing and treatment response prediction are neoplastic cell abundance, metastatic tissue sample and stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
