<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In animal model, sericin has been reported to have anti-tumoral action against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the activity of sericin against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effects of sericin on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> SW480 cells compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosal FHC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the size of the sericin protein may be important for its activity, two ranges of molecular weight were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sericin was found to decrease SW480 and FHC cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The small sericin had higher anti-proliferative effects than that of the large sericin in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>Increased apoptosis</z:mp> of SW480 cells is associated with increased caspase-3 activity and decreased Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anti-proliferative effect of sericin was accompanied by cell cycle arrest at the S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, sericin reduced SW480 cell viability by inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via caspase-3 activation and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study provides scientific data that support the protective effect of silk sericin against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells of the colon and suggests that this protein may have significant health benefits and could potentially be developed as a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
