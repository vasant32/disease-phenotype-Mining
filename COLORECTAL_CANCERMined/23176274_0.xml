<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its plasma level is normally low but 4G/4G homozygotes have higher concentrations of PAI 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This genotype may be associated with worse prognosis and proximal location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> than 5G/5G homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our prospective evaluation we examined plasma level PAI 1 (using photometric microplate method ELISA) pre-surgery and, subsequently, 6-8 weeks later, from 80 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the PAI 1 rs1799889 -675 4G/5G polymorphism test the PCR amplification was used.Analysis of collected data was confirmed that significantly higher plasma levels of PAI 1 were found in patients before starting therapy, which decreased (p=0.004) after initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher plasma level PAI 1 before (p=0.013) and after therapy (p=0.004) had significantly shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no relationship between polymorphisms of PAI 1 (-675 4G/5G) in relation to stage, survival or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAI 1 is useful as a negative marker of prognosis and could be advantageous when planning adjuvant treatment of patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although opinions on the importance of polymorphisms of PAI 1 in relation to the prognosis are not uniform, it does seem that their role in the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is not essential </plain></SENT>
