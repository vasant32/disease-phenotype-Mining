<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occupancy of β-catenin at promoters of Wnt target genes drives transcription, but the mechanism of β-catenin action remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) interacts with β-catenin and positively modulates β-catenin-mediated gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with constitutively high Wnt/β-catenin activity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CARM1 inhibits expression of endogenous Wnt/β-catenin target genes and suppresses clonal survival and anchorage-independent growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also identified a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (RKO) with a low basal level of β-catenin, which is dramatically elevated by treatment with Wnt3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wnt3a also increased the expression of a subset of endogenous Wnt target genes, and CARM1 was required for the Wnt-induced expression of these target genes and the accompanying dimethylation of arginine 17 of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of β-catenin from RKO cells diminished the Wnt-induced occupancy of CARM1 on a Wnt target gene, indicating that CARM1 is recruited to Wnt target genes through its interaction with β-catenin and contributes to transcriptional activation by mediating events (including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 methylation) that are downstream from the actions of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CARM1 is an important positive modulator of Wnt/β-catenin transcription and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, and may thereby represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> involving aberrantly activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling </plain></SENT>
