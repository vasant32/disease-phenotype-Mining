<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised 1,613 patients with BTI, among which 32 cases (1.98%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparison group included 8,065 randomly selected subjects (5 for every patient with BTI), 74 of whom contracted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (0.92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stratified Cox proportional hazard regressions were calculated to estimate the adjusted hazard of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between the study group and comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adjusted hazard ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for patients with BTI was 6.54 times (95% CI = 3.07-13.92) as high as for those without BTI within a 1-year follow-up period, 3.20 times (95% CI = 1.93-5.30) as high within a 3-year follow-up period, and 2.21 times (95% CI = 1.45-3.37) as high within a 5-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that the adjusted hazard ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> for those with <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>bile duct inflammation</z:mp> was 3.30 times (95% CI = 1.87-5.84) as high as for those without BTI within the 5-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no increased hazard of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was observed for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003251'>gallbladder inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that patients with BTI had a significantly higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared to patients without BTI </plain></SENT>
