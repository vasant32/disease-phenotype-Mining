<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with a large Body Surface Area, chemotherapy drug doses are often reduced, as studies have suggested that their pharmacokinetics may be altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this strategy may result in underdosing <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three Medical Research Council trials of chemotherapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, dose reductions were not mandated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This provided the opportunity to compare the toxicity levels in those <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients fully dosed and to investigate if those under dosed experienced a worse survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body Mass Index (BMI) was used to classify patients as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (BMI &lt; 25), overweight (BMI 25-29), or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI 30+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 4781 patients, 2158 (45%) were classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight, 1753 (37%) as overweight, and 870 (18%) as <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that, in those patients fully dosed, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients experienced more toxicity or that dose-reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients resulted in less toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was a suggestion that those <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients who were given reduced doses had a worse progression-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.39, P = 0.006] and a slightly worse overall survival (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96-1.30, P = 0.152) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results, although not a randomised comparison, do not support the policy of reducing chemotherapy doses for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
