<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) along with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> has been attempted and reported in multiple single series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to examine the feasibility, procedural safety, and oncological integrity of 1-stage totally laparoscopic procedure for the radical resection of liver metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a head-to-head comparison with the 1-stage open procedure simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients who underwent selective 1-stage concomitant resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> between January 2004 and December 2008 (laparoscopy group, n=13) were retrospectively enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving open 1-stage resection (laparotomy group) were retrospectively included at the ratio of 1:1 (n=13 out of 71), matching the laparoscopy group in sex, age, body mass index, site and stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, location and size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and adjuvant therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the thirteen 1-stage laparoscopic procedures were successfully completed, without conversion to open procedure or additional incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative duration of laparoscopic procedure was shorter than that of open procedure (313 ± 44 vs. 350 ± 46 min, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of blood loss was comparable between the 2 groups (259 ± 111 vs. 273 ± 95 mL, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing laparoscopic procedure resumed off-bed activities, bowel movement, and oral intake earlier than those undergoing open procedure, and also had a shorter hospitalization stay (8.5 ± 1.9 vs. 11.2 ± 1.8 d, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 1 clinically significant adverse event occurred in a patient who developed bile leak after the laparoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were comparable between the 2 groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-stage synchronous laparoscopic resection of liver metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is a feasible, effective, and safe modality in specifically indicated patients, both accelerating postoperative recovery and shortening hospitalization time </plain></SENT>
