<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard CFD assays are work-intensive and expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> a new simple CFD assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mice inoculated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, CFD levels correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with healthy subjects, 38 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) had higher preoperative CFD levels (798 ± 409 vs 308 ± 256 ng/mL; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients free of disease at 1 year, CFD levels were elevated in patients who remained with disease or died (DD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CFD correlated with DD (P = .033), and a combined index of carcinoembryonic antigen × CFD exhibited a better correlation to DD than did pathologic staging (P = .0027 vs P = .0065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, CFD levels were prognostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large prospective study will need to be performed to truly evaluate the efficacy of this method for early detection, follow-up, and evaluation of patient response to treatment </plain></SENT>
