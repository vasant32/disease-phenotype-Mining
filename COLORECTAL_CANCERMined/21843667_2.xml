<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The emergence of laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) has been shown to greatly improve the accuracy and sensitivity of global protein expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their combined use in profiling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> proteome has rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied these techniques to profile the protein expression changes of the late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and its <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study revealed that both the primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary tumours</z:e> showed a distinct protein expression profile compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, but were indistinguishable from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differential analysis between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> and patient-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa identified a total of 71 proteins to be altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 40% of these proteins have been previously reported as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related proteins, validating the accuracy of the current analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also identified many previously unknown changes including overexpression of ACY1, HSC70, HnRNP I, HnRNP A3, SET, ANP32A and TUFM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which have been further verified by western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> in combination with 2D-DIGE is a powerful tool to analyse the proteome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues and may lead to the identification of potential novel protein markers and therapeutic targets for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
