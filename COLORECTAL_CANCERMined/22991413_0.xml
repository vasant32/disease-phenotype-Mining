<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to develop a clinically feasible and robust prognostic classifier for these patients independent of adjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Global gene expression profiles from altogether 387 stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue samples from three independent patient series were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ColoGuidePro, a seven-gene prognostic classifier, was developed from a selected Norwegian learning series (n = 95; no adjuvant treatment) using lasso-penalized multivariate survival modeling with cross-validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression signature significantly stratified patients in a consecutive Norwegian test series, in which patients were treated according to current standards [HR, 2.9 (1.1-7.5); P = 0.03; n = 77] and an external validation series [HR, 3.7 (2.0-6.8); P &lt; 0.001; n = 215] according to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ColoGuidePro was also an independent predictor of prognosis in multivariate models including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage in both series (HR, ≥ 3.1; P ≤ 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the validation series, which consisted of patients from other populations (United States and Australia), 5-year relapse-free survival was significantly predicted for stage III patients only (P &lt; 0.001; n = 107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, prognostic stratification was independent of adjuvant treatment (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present ColoGuidePro, a prognostic classifier developed for patients with stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The test is suitable for transfer to clinical use and has best prognostic prediction potential for stage III patients </plain></SENT>
