<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In an ongoing clinical trial, the genetic and environmental risk assessment (GERA) blood test offers subjects information about personal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk through measurement of two novel low-to-moderate risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine predictors of uptake of the GERA blood test among participants randomized to the Intervention arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary care patients aged 50 to 74 years eligible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening are randomized to receive a mailed stool blood test kit to complete at home (Control) or to the control condition plus an in-office blood test called GERA that includes assessment of red blood cell <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and DNA-testing for two MTHFR (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the present study, baseline survey data are examined in participants randomized to the Intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first 351 intervention participants (161 African American/190 white) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 249 (70.9%) completed GERA testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictors of GERA uptake included race (African American race, odds ratio (OR) 0.51 (0.29 to 0.87)), and being more knowledgeable about GERA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (OR 1.09 (1.01 to 1.18)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Being married (OR 1.81 (1.09 to 3.00)) was also significant in the multivariable model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participant uptake of GERA testing was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GERA uptake varied, however, according to socio-demographic background and knowledge </plain></SENT>
