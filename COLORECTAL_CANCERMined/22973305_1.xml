<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>60% of patients operated for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) will develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> and some may be candidates for a repeated liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to evaluate differences in intraoperative blood loss and complications comparing the primary and the repeated liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), as well as to evaluate differences in long-time follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>32 patients underwent 34 repeated liver resections due to recurrence of CRLM an studied retrospectively to identify potential differences between the primary and the repeat resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no 30-day postoperative mortality or postoperative hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median blood loss at repeat resection (1850 mL) was significantly (P = 0.014) higher as compared to the primary liver resection (1000 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This did not have any effect on the rate of complications, even though increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in itself was a risk factor for complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in survival at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A repeated liver resection for CRLM was associated with an increased intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as compared to the first resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations include presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e>, deranged vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, more complicated operations and the effects on the liver by chemotherapy following the first liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>30 out of 32 patients had only one reresection of the liver </plain></SENT>
