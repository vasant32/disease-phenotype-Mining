<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PNs are stable in aqueous media and showed no significant toxicity up to 1 mg · mL(-1)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon exposure to 808 nm light, the PNs generated temperatures above 50 °C </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At concentrations above 100 µg · mL(-1) for nano-PCPDTBSe, cell viability was less than 20%, while at concentrations above 62 µg · mL(-1) for nano-PCPDTBT, cell viability was less than 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this work demonstrate that low band gap D-A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53710">conjugated polymers</z:chebi> 1) can be formed into nanoparticles that are stable in aqueous media; 2) are non-toxic until stimulated by IR light and 3) have a high photothermal efficiency </plain></SENT>
