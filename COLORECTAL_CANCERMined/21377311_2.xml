<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of novel representations of randomness on risk perceptions, worry, and subjective uncertainty about individualized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A web-based factorial experiment was conducted, in which 225 adults aged 40 years and older were provided with hypothetical individualized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk estimates, using 5 different textual and visual representations varying in expressed randomness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> worry, and subjective uncertainty about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk; the moderating effect of dispositional optimism was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Representational format was significantly associated with subjective uncertainty about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, but not with perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk or worry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A format using software-based animation to express randomness dynamically led to the highest subjective uncertainty, although a static visual non-random format also increased uncertainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dispositional optimism moderated this effect; between-format differences in uncertainty were significant only for participants with low optimism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Representing randomness in individualized estimates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk increases subjective uncertainty about risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A novel dynamic visual format produces the greatest effect, which is moderated by individual differences in optimism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Novel representations of randomness may be effective in improving people's understanding of the essential uncertainty pertaining to individualized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk estimates </plain></SENT>
