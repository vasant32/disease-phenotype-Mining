<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our surgical clinic treated 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, of whom 28 (57.14%) were men of mean age 62 years and 21 (42.86%) were women of mean age 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 15 cases, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was related to the rectum (30.61%) and the remaining 34 cases (69.39%) were related to the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One was found in the blank and the upper right while the second was found in the transverse and sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of our patients suffered from coexisting biliary lithiasis and underwent simultaneous cholecystectomy, and simultaneous bile duct exploration for common bile duct lithiasis was performed in one of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were treated surgically on an emergency basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to septic shock and multiple organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, we noted seven complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which involved patients who had undergone emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The length of hospital stay was 8-14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients with stage IV disease died 2 years after surgery, and the remainder are still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> still occurs after the sixth decade, with a male predominance, and is mainly located in the rectum and sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> in our region indicates inadequate diagnostic access for the residents of our region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, mortality remains low </plain></SENT>
