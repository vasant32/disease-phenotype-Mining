<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Previous studies have observed an association between ABO blood group and risk for certain gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including pancreatic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether there is such an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, possible relationships between ABO blood groups and Rh factor and KRAS status in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: In 1,620 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, blood group and Rh factor were examined and compared with the control group of 3,022,883 healthy volunteer blood donors of the Turkish Red Crescent between 2004 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship of blood groups with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> K-ras status was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Overall distributions of ABO blood groups as well as Rh factor were comparable between patients (45% A, 7.2% AB, 16.4% B, 31.4% O, and 87.2% Rh+) and controls (42.2% A, 7.6% AB, 16.3% B, 33.9% O, and 87.7% Rh+) (p=0.099) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were statistically significant difference between patients and controls with respect to O vs. non O blood group (p=0.033) and marginally significant difference for A vs. non-A blood group (p=0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients, the median age was 62 (range 17-97), 58.1% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences respect to sex and K-ras status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: In present study, the ABO/Rh blood groups were statistically significantly associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no relationship between K-ras status and ABO blood group and Rh factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However further studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to establish the role of blood groups and to define the mechanisms by which ABO blood type affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
