<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is usually developed on preexisting lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This makes this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> accessible to a prevention strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients under 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study involved 133 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> recruited in CHU Ibn-Rochd, Casablanca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data relating age, sex, stage at presentation, histological type and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location were obtained from the pathological and clinical records of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed to compare clinicopathological data in patients under 50 years and in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The average age of patients was 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of patients aged 50 or under was 40.6% The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the youngest age group were more often mucinous and signet ring cells (18.5%) versus (5.1%) in the oldest age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The right colon was more often affected in the youngest age group, 38.9% versus 17.7% in the oldest age group (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proposition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in subjects 50 or under was high in Morocco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancers</z:e> in the youngest age group were more often mucinous or signet ring cells and was more often located in the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We intend to complete this study by a genetic study to help improve prevention and care of young patient </plain></SENT>
