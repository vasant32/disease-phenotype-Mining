<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: KRAS status was first determined locally but subsequent validation of KRAS status and additional screenings (rare KRAS, NRAS, BRAF mutations and EGFR copy number) were centrally assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received panitumumab (6 mg/kg) and irinotecan (180 mg/mÂ²) every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-five eligible patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate (ORR) was 29.2% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 18.2-40.3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free and overall survivals were 5.5 and 9.7 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most frequent grade 3/4 toxic effects were skin 32.3%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> 15.4% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> 12.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were available for 60 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the confirmed KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> population codon 12 or 13 mutation (n = 54), ORR was 35.2% (95% CI 22.4.1-47.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had a NRAS, a BRAF or a rare KRAS mutation, and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response was observed in this subgroup when compared with 46.3% (95% CI 31.1-61.6) ORR in the subgroup of 41 patients with no identified mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Panitumumab and irinotecan is an active third-line regimen in a well-defined population based on biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00655499 </plain></SENT>
