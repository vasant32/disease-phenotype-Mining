<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Care for patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) has traditionally focused on managing HF alone; however, little is known about the prevalence and contribution of comorbidity to mortality among this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the impact of comorbidity on mortality in older adults with HF with high mortality risk and those with lower mortality risk, as defined by presence or absence of a prior hospitalization for HF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study (2002-2006) of 18,322 age-matched and gender-matched Medicare beneficiaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the baseline year of 2002 to ascertain HF hospitalization history, in order to identify beneficiaries at either high or low risk of future HF mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated the prevalence of 19 comorbidities and overall comorbidity burden, defined as a count of conditions, among both high and low risk beneficiaries, in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazards regressions were used to determine the effect of individual comorbidity and comorbidity burden on mortality between 2002 and 2006 among both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most comorbidities were significantly more prevalent among hospitalized versus non-hospitalized beneficiaries; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD), and hip fracture were more than twice as prevalent in the hospitalized group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among hospitalized beneficiaries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, COPD, CKD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, hip fracture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> were each significantly associated with increased hazard of dying (hazard ratios [HRs]: 1.16-1.93), adjusting for age, gender and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality risk associated with most comorbidities was higher among non-hospitalized beneficiaries (HRs: 1.32-3.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity confers a significantly increased mortality risk even among older adults with an overall high mortality risk due to HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians who routinely care for this population should consider the impact of comorbidity on outcomes in their overall management of HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such information may also be useful when considering the risks and benefits of aggressive, high-intensity life-prolonging interventions </plain></SENT>
