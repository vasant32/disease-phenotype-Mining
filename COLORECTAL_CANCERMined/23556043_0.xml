<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography evaluation of the lesion and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> status of the biliary tree was always performed prior to the procedure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single trans-hepatic track technique was preferred (T-configuration stenting) and a second, contra-lateral trans-hepatic track (Y-configuration stenting) was used only in cases of inability to access the contra-lateral lobe using a single track technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study's primary endpoints were clinical success, defined as a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels within 10 d and patient survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included peri-procedural complications, primary and secondary patency rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 35 patients (18 female, 51.4%) with a mean age 69 ± 13 years (range 33-88) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The procedures were performed between March 2000 and June 2008 and mean time follow-up was 13.5 ± 22.0 mo (range 0-96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The underlying malignant disease was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath> (n = 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (n = 9), pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005396" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bile duct tumor</z:e> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (n = 2), gallbladder <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (n = 1) or non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, various self-expandable bare metal stents with diameters ranging from 7 to 10 mm were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Stents were placed in Y-configuration in 24/35 cases (68.6%) using two stents in 12/24 patients and three stents in 12/24 cases (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A T-configuration stent placement was performed in 11/35 patients (31.4%), using two stents in 4/11 cases (36.4%) and three stents in 7/11 cases (63.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (35/35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patient survival ranged from 0 to 1763 d and the mean survival time was 168 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Clinical success rate was 77.1% (27/35 cases), and peri-procedural mortality rate was 5.7% (2/35 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Biliary re-obstruction due to stent occlusion occurred in 25.7% of the cases (9/35 patients), while in 7/11 (63.6%) one additional percutaneous re-intervention due to stent occlusion resulting in clinical relapse of symptomatology was successfully performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 4/11 patients (36.4%) more than 1 additional reintervention was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The median decrease of total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> was 60.5% and occurred in 81.8% of the cases (27/33 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The median primary and secondary patency was 105 (range 0-719) and 181 d (range 5-1763), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>According to the Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis, the estimated survival rate was 73.5%, 47.1% and 26.1% at 1, 6 and 12 mo respectively, while the 8-year survival rate was 4.9% </plain></SENT>
