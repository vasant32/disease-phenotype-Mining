<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-888 is an orally available inhibitor of this enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to evaluate the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-888 combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: RT clonogenic assays were performed on HCT116 and HT29 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, irinotecan, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> with or without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surviving fraction at 2 Gy and dose-modifying factor at 10% survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Synergism was assessed by isobologram analysis for combination therapies. γH2AX and neutral comet assays were performed to assess the effect of therapy on DSB formation/repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo assessments were made by use of HCT116 cells in a xenograft mouse model </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both lines were radiosensitized by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> alone, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> further increased chemotherapy dose-modifying factors to the 1.6 to 1.8 range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> combinations were synergistic (combination indices &lt;0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased DSB after RT (γH2AX, 69% vs 43%; P=.017) and delayed repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> delays of 7.22 days for RT; 11.90 days for RT and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>; 13.5 days for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, RT, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>; 14.17 days for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, RT, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>; and 23.81 days for irinotecan, RT, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-888 radiosensitizes at similar or higher levels compared with classic chemotherapies and acts synergistically with these chemotherapies to enhance RT effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In vivo confirmation of these results indicates a potential role for combining its use with existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> regimens </plain></SENT>
