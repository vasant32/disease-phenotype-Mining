<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In multiple cohort studies, colonoscopic polypectomy has been shown to significantly reduce the expected incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by 76% to 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic polypectomy is performed frequently in primary, secondary and tertiary and medical centers in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there are no evidence-based, procedural guidelines for the appropriate performance of this procedure, including the technical aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the guideline presented here, Pubmed, Medline, and Cochrane Library literature searches were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When little or no data from well-designed prospective trials were available, an emphasis was placed on the results from large series and reports from recognized experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, these guidelines for colonoscopic polypectomy are based on a critical review of the available data as well as expert consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients </plain></SENT>
