<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a multiplex detection approach to efficiently quantify these markers for clinical applications such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative allele-specific real-time target and signal amplification (QuARTS) combines a polymerase-based target amplification with an invasive cleavage-based signal amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fluorescence signal is detected in a fashion similar to real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured the dynamic range and analytical sensitivity of multiplex QuARTS reactions with titrated plasmid DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used the QuARTS technology to quantify methylated BMP3, NDRG4, VIM, and TFPI2 genes on 91 DNA samples extracted from colorectal tissues, including 37 cancers, 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and 29 healthy epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The assays were designed in triplex format that incorporated ACTB as a reference gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Percent methylation was calculated by dividing methylated strands over ACTB strands and multiplying by 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The QuARTS method linearly detected methylated or unmethylated VIM gene down to 10 copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No cross-reactivity was observed when methylated assays were used to amplify 10(5) copies of unmethylated gene and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The multiplex assay detected methylated genes spiked in unmethylated genes at a 0.01% ratio and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a diagnostic specificity cutoff of 95%, methylated BMP3, NDRG4, VIM, and TFPI2 detected 84%, 92%, 86%, and 92% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and 68%, 76%, 76%, and 88% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The QuARTS technology provides a promising approach for quantifying methylated markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The markers assayed highly discriminated colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> from healthy epithelia </plain></SENT>
