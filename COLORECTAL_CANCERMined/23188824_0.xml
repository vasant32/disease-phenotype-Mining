<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the consequences of endogenous mutant K-Ras, we analyzed the signaling and biological properties of a small panel of isogenic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines DLD1, HCT116, and Hec1A, in which either the WT or mutant K-ras allele has been disrupted, and SW48 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and human mammary epithelial cells in which a single copy of mutant K-ras was introduced at its endogenous genomic locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find that single copy mutant K-Ras causes surprisingly modest activation of downstream signaling to ERK and Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a negative feedback signaling loop to EGFR and N-Ras occurs in some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutant K-Ras also had relatively minor effects on cell proliferation and cell migration but more dramatic effects on cell transformation as assessed by growth in soft agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, knock-out of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> K-ras allele consistently increased growth in soft agar, suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressive properties of this gene under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we examined the effects of single copy mutant K-Ras on global gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although transcriptional programs triggered by mutant K-Ras were generally quite distinct in the different cell lines, there was a small number of genes that were consistently overexpressed, and these could be used to monitor K-Ras inhibition in a panel of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there are conserved components of mutant K-Ras signaling and phenotypes but that many depend on cell context and environmental cues </plain></SENT>
