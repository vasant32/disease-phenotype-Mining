<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We examined the presence and correlates of Black/White racial disparities in adherence to guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (CRCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample included 328 Black and 1827 White patients age 50-75 from 24 VA medical facilities who responded to a mailed survey with phone follow-up (response rate: 73% for Blacks and 89% for Whites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CRCS adherence and race were obtained through surveys and supplemented with administrative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regressions estimated the contribution of demographic, health, cognitive, and environmental factors to racial disparities in adherence to CRCS guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, Blacks had slightly lower rates of adherence to CRCS guidelines than Whites (72% versus 77%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This racial disparity in CRCS adherence was explained by race differences in demographic, health, and environmental factors but not by cognitive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tests for interactions revealed that the association of race with adherence varied significantly across levels of income, education, and marital status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, among those who were married with higher levels of education, CRCS adherence was significantly higher for Whites; whereas among those who were unmarried, with low levels of education, adherence was significantly higher for Blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that disparities in CRCS are greatly attenuated in the VA system and both Whites and Blacks have substantially higher rates of CRCS than the national average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results point to the success of the VA at implementing CRCS system-wide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest additional initiatives may be needed for unmarried low income white men and higher income black men </plain></SENT>
