<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been substantial differences in pathologic results between forceps biopsies (FB) and resection specimen (RS) of the colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate predictive factors of the underestimated pathology in FB compared with RS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 248 consecutive patients with colorectal intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> ≥10 mm, which was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection, were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with no FB on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> before the resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics including size, locations, surface appearances, and the number of FB fragments were evaluated as potential factors associated with the discrepancies by logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 179 lesions from 171 patients were included in the study (size, 28.37 ± 12.00 mm; range 10-80 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall number of discrepancy cases was 103 (57.5��%), where 90 (50.3 %) were underestimated in FB and 13 (7.2 %) downgraded in their RS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, round [odds ratio (OR) 4.46, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.76-11.30, p = 0.002], depressed (OR 3.23, 95 % CI 1.11-9.39, p = 0.031), and mixed type of surface appearance (OR 5.47, 95 % CI 2.38-12.60, p &lt; 0.001), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size ≥30 mm (OR 2.14, 95 % CI 1.12-4.10, p = 0.021) were significant predictive factors for underestimated pathology in FB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Underestimation in FB is remarkable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> ≥10 mm in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy is associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, such as surface appearance and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> should be carefully examined for an adequate management strategy of colorectal epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
