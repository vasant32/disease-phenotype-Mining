<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, critics argue that, to date, a reduction of incidence and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has not been demonstrated in a population-based setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among individuals screened by colonoscopy and non-screened individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A closed cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Population-based setting in a precisely defined area with a low level of population migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved 1912 screened and 20,774 control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases in this closed cohort study were prospectively collected during the screening period of 1 year and the follow-up period of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up data were corrected for negligible migration balance in the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> characteristics and risk or protective factors, age and sex, participation in general health screening examinations, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a first-degree relative, smoking status, body mass index, frequency of sports activity, eating habits, and patients' professions were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence was significantly lower in the screened group compared with the non-screened group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.59; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon cancer</z:hpo>-associated mortality also was clearly lower (adjusted OR 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.93; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factors such as lifestyle, smoking, and body mass index as well as family history were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Blue-collar workers had a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were a positive family history and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Number and ethnicity of the participants, non-randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy with polypectomy significantly reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related mortality in the general population </plain></SENT>
