<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors previously demonstrated that perineural invasion is an independent prognostic factor of outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the current study, they hypothesized that neurogenesis occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and portends an aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, samples from 236 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were used to create a tissue array and database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue array slides were immunostained for protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) to identify nerve tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between markers of neurogenesis and oncologic outcomes was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells on stimulating neurogenesis in vitro was evaluated using a dorsal root ganglia coculture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibited high degrees of neurogenesis had 50% reductions in 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival compared with patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> contained no detectable neurogenesis (P = .002 and P = .006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage II disease and high degrees of neurogenesis had greater reductions in 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival compared with lymph node-negative patients with no neurogenesis (P = .002 and P = .008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage II disease and high degrees of neurogenesis had lower 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival compared with patients who had stage III disease with no neurogenesis (P = .01 and P = .008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> cells stimulated neurogenesis and exhibited evidence of neuroepithelial interactions between nerves and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neurogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> appeared to play a critical role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the current results indicated that neurogenesis functions as an independent predictor of outcomes and may play a role in therapy stratification for patients with lymph node-negative disease </plain></SENT>
