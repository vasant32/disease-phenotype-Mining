<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: WAG/RijCrl rats were inoculated in the left hepatic lobe with 25,000 syngeneic CC-531 <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells, after which they were randomized into two groups: control (CG) and infused (IG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After confirming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> induction, the IG rats received intra-arterial suspensions of Fe₃O��� nanoparticles (2.6 mg) in Lipiodol® (0.15 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To calculate the iron concentration, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18248">[Fe]</z:chebi>, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and liver tissues of both groups of rats, measurements of signal intensity from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, healthy liver tissue, and paravertebral muscles were made on a 1.5T MRI system in gradient-echo DP* and T2*-weighted sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, samples were collected to quantify the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18248">[Fe]</z:chebi> by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), as well as for histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with non-parametric tests, and Bland-Altman plots were produced; P values &lt;0.05 were considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the CG rats (n = 23), the mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18248">[Fe]</z:chebi> values estimated by MRI and ICP-MS were 13.2 μmol·g⁻¹ and 5.9 μmol·g⁻¹, respectively, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and 19.0 μmol ·g⁻¹ and 11.7 μmol·g⁻¹, respectively, in the hepatic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the IG rats (n = 19), the values obtained by MRI and ICP-MS were 148.9 μmol·g⁻¹ and 9.4 μmol · g⁻¹, respectively, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and 115.3 μmol·g⁻¹ and 11.6 μmol·g⁻¹, respectively, in the healthy liver tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IG results revealed a clear disagreement between MRI and ICP-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the comparative analysis between the groups regarding the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18248">[Fe]</z:chebi> values obtained by ICP-MS, significant differences were found for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples (P &lt; 0.001), but not for the hepatic tissue (P = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under microscopy, scattered intravascular deposits of nanoparticles were observed, especially in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICP-MS demonstrated significant uptake of exogenous iron in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRI was useful for quantifying the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18248">[Fe]</z:chebi> in the different tissues in the CG animals, but not in the IG animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the irregular distribution of nanoparticles caused an important bias in the measurements obtained by MRI, the relative increase in iron content inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was suggested </plain></SENT>
