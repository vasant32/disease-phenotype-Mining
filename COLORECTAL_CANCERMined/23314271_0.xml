<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase I clinical trial of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> vaccine therapy together with oral anticancer drugs was conducted to treat advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using synthesized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigens in order to confirm the safety, immunogenicity and activity of this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were patients with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type of A2402 who had inoperable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but had failed to respond to or were unable to undergo standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (RNF43, TOMM34, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) were emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Montanide), and the resulting solution was administered subcutaneously once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received the oral anticancer drug tegafur-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> plus leucovorin for four weeks continuously as part of one course followed by one week of rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of the trial was observation of adverse events as determined by the NCI-CTCAE criteria, and the secondary endpoints were the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and the number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the peripheral blood after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vaccine therapy was administered 148 times to 10 patients from July 2008 to December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adverse events were grade 1 redness and induration, a grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0200042'>skin ulcer</z:hpo> at the vaccination site and grade 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients tolerated treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> imaging revealed that after 1 course of treatment 1 patient had partial response (PR), 7 had stable disease (SD) and 2 had progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A CTL assay of 10 patients revealed an increase in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-specific CTLs in patients with PR and SD, and the clinical responses of those patients were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Kaplan‑Meier analysis indicated that patients who had a strong CTL reaction had a tendency to have longer progression‑free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
