<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An outpatient-based face-to-face survey was conducted from August 18 to September 7, 2010 in Changhai Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 1200 consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 years were recruited for interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening was pre-measured as a predictor variable, and other predictors included age, gender, educational level, monthly household income and health insurance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between these predictors and screening behavior, screening willingness and screening approach were examined using Pearson's χ(2) test and logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of these outpatients, 22.5% had undergone <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening prior to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who had participated in the screening were more likely to have good knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening (OR: 5.299, 95% CI: 3.415-8.223), have health insurance (OR: 1.996, 95% CI: 1.426-2.794) and older in age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher income, however, was found to be a barrier to the screening (OR: 0.633, 95% CI: 0.467-0.858) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An analysis of screening willingness showed that 37.5% of the patients would voluntarily participated in a screen at the recommended age, but 41.3% would do so under doctor's advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening willingness was positively correlated with the patient's knowledge status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher knowledge levels would like to participate in the screening (OR: 4.352, 95% CI: 3.008-6.298), and they would select colonoscopy as a screening approach (OR: 3.513, 95% CI: 2.290-5.389) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, higher income level was, again, a barrier to colonoscopic screening (OR: 0.667, 95% CI: 0.505-0.908) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient's level of knowledge and income should be taken into consideration when conducting a feasible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
