<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to detect the yearly yield of colonoscopy in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive endoscopies in the years 1992-2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Important endoscopic diagnoses were defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, diverticuli and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 19 569 endoscopies were performed, of which 1706 (8.7%) were in patients age 80 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of women was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients who were 80 years or older was higher than in the general population and remained stable during the study period, though there has been a proportional increase of elderly people in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inconclusive procedures were present in 106 (6.2%) elderly patients compared with 277 (1.6%) patients under 80 years of age (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in the consecutive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A procedure revealing no endoscopic diagnosis was observed less often in patients who were 80 years or older (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed in 221 (19.6%) older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This figure remained more or less constant each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyps</z:mpath> were seen in 448 (8.8%) patients 80 years of age or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with diverticuli and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The number of patients 80 years or older with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> rose at a lower rate than the number of older people in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The yield of colonoscopy in patients 80 years or older was high and constant over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> rose less than expected compared to the increase of elderly in the general population </plain></SENT>
