<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We calculated the incidence and standardized incidence and mortality rate ratios of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among adult individuals with intact colons using Kaiser Permanente of Northern California's database of members with IBD and general membership data for the period of 1998 to June 2010 (data through 2008 were used to calculate mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated trends in medication use and rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 29 cancers among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 53 among persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> among individuals with CD, UC, or in the general membership were 75.0, 76.0, and 47.1, respectively, per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the general population, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 21% higher in 2007-2010 than in 1998-2001 (P for trend, &lt;.0001), coincident with the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among individuals with CD or UC was 60% higher than in the general population (95% confidence interval [CI] for CD, 20%-200%; 95% CI for UC, 30%-200%) and was stable over time (P for trend was as follows: CD, .98; UC, .40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 1998-2008, the standardized mortality ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in individuals with CD was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.6-3.0) and 2.0 in those with UC (95% CI, 1.3-2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over the study period, anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor agents replaced other therapies for CD and UC; the rate of colonoscopy increased by 33% among patients with CD and decreased by 9% in those with UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From 1998 to 2010, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with IBD was 60% higher than in the general population and essentially stable over time </plain></SENT>
