<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the therapy of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is the inhibition of cell proliferation and/or induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In present experiment, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects and associated mechanisms of paeoniflorin (PF), isolated from the paeony root, against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, cell growth assay obviously showed the inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis showed that PF could mainly have the cell cycle arrest at G1, which is associated with DNA damage and activation of p53/14-3-3 zeta (ζ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pro-apoptotic effect of PF was demonstrated by Annexin V-PI staining, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 by Western immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the results showed that positive cells of PCNA in PF and docetaxel-treated group was decreased to 30% and 15% compared with control group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> cells in PF- and docetaxel treated groups studied by TUNEL is increased to 40 ± 1.2% and 30 ± 1.5% compared with 24 ± 2.3% in negative control, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the efficiency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice treated by PF was superior to docetaxel in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, PF may be an effective chemopreventive agent against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> HT29, and the mechanism could be mediated via an regulation of p53/14-3-3ζ </plain></SENT>
