<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, studies of non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (ncRNA) may contribute to the discovery of possible biomarkers in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering that the response to chemotherapy can differ amongst individuals, researchers have begun to isolate and identify the genes responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identification of targets of this ncRNA associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> can suggest that networks of these linked to oncogenes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors play pivotal roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these ncRNA are attractive drug targets since they may be differentially expressed in malignant versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells and regulate expression of critical proteins in the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on ncRNAs that are differently expressed in malignant tissue, and discusses some of challenges derived from their use as potential biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> properties </plain></SENT>
