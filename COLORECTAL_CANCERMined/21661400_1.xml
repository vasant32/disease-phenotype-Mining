<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although changes in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the specific association between serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and lymph node stages remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Fasting serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, including TC, TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> was retrospectively evaluated in 968 patients undergoing curative resection for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the nutritional status, the serum albumin levels were measured and BMI was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile with lymph node stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels correlated well with rate of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels tended to present more advanced lymph node stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed elevation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio for patients with N2 stage was statistically significant when compared with patients with N1 stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When separated by gender, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio had independent association with advanced N2 stage in males, but not in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio might be a more effective biomarker for identifying N2 stage than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> levels alone (OR value: 2.85 vs. 1.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> levels and an increased LDC-C/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio might favour development of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and LDCC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio might be a more effective biomarker for identifying advanced N2 stage than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> levels alone, especially for male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
