<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One major difficulty is partly due to the limitations of parametric-statistical methods for detection of gene effects that are dependent solely or partially on interactions with other genes or environmental exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on our previous case-control study in Chongqing of China, we have found increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> exists in individuals carrying a novel homozygous TT at locus rs1329149 and known homozygous AA at locus rs671 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we proposed statistical method- crossover analysis in combination with logistic regression model, to further analyze our data and focus on assessing gene-environmental interactions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of the crossover analysis showed that there are possible multiplicative interactions between loci rs671 and rs1329149 with alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multi- factorial logistic regression analysis also validated that loci rs671 and rs1329149 both exhibited a multiplicative interaction with alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we also found additive interactions between any pair of two factors (among the four risk factors: gene loci rs671, rs1329149, age and alcohol consumption) through the crossover analysis, which was not evident on logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the method based on crossover analysis-logistic regression is successful in assessing additive and multiplicative gene-environment interactions, and in revealing synergistic effects of gene loci rs671 and rs1329149 with alcohol consumption in the pathogenesis and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
