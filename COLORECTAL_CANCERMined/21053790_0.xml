<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For most patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, dealing with the adjustment and rehabilitation after treatment can be overwhelming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a significant need for expert educational and counseling support, especially for the patient with a new ostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This pilot study describes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> staff nurses' knowledge about and attitudes toward providing direct ostomy care support and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is part of a larger project assessing gaps in education and services in support of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Survey on Ostomy Care questionnaire designed to assess nurses' knowledge about and attitudes toward ostomy care was administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> staff nurses at a comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 30% of staff nurses surveyed strongly agreed or agreed with the statement, "I care for ostomy patients often enough to keep up my skills in ostomy care." Maintaining staff nurses' ability to teach and demonstrate to patients complex care such as ostomy care depends on the ability to practice both education and hands-on skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staff nurses identify that lack of opportunity to care for the new ostomy patient influences their ability to maintain skill expertise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results show the need to explore the provision of ongoing staff education for low-volume patient populations using creative teaching strategies, such as clinical simulation and short videos </plain></SENT>
