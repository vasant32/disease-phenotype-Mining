<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> are a subgroup of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> that have been associated with a distinct biology and a more aggressive clinical behavior compared to their polypoid counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aimed to compare the mutation spectrum of 14 cancer genes, between these two phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 106 flat and 93 polypoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was analyzed retrospectively for frequently occurring mutations in "hot spot" regions of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and NRAS, as well as selected mutations in CTNNB1 (β-catenin), EGFR, FBXW7 (CDC4), PTEN, STK11, MAP2K4, SMAD4, PIK3R1 and PDGFRA using a high-throughput genotyping technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, APC was analyzed using direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APC mutations were more frequent in polypoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared to flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (48.5% versus 30.3%, respectively, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, FBXW7 and CTNNB1 showed similar frequencies in both phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between the different subtypes of flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (0-IIa, LST-F and LST-G) no differences were observed for any of the investigated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lower APC mutation rate in flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> compared to polypoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> suggests that disruption of the Wnt-pathway may occur via different mechanisms in these two phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in contrast to previous observations our results in this large well-defined sample set indicate that there is no significant association between the different morphological phenotypes and mutations in key genes of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-RAF-MAPK pathway </plain></SENT>
