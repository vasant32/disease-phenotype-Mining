<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In total, 43 713 subjects were recruited in the screening program who were the registered people aged 40 - 74 in Xiacheng and Jiashan during year 2007 - 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first screening involved questionnaire survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> related risk factors and fecal occult blood test (FOBT), colonoscopy was performed when a positive result was observed in the first screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were found during colonoscopy, biopsy and pathological diagnosis were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The screening data were analyzed and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> detection rate was calculated according to age or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 6489 subjects (14.85%) belonged to the high risk group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the first screening, in which 4701 subjects finished complete colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, 569 colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> were diagnosed, the detection rate was 12.10% (95%CI: 11.17% - 13.04%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It included 52 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (1.11%, 95%CI: 0.81% - 1.41%), 183 advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (3.89%, 95%CI: 3.34% - 4.45%), 334 non-advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (7.10%, 95%CI: 6.37% - 7.84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest detective rate was observed in male group that aged 70 - 74 (22.81%, 95%CI: 16.98% - 28.70%), the lowest detective rate was observed in female group aged 40 - 44 (2.49%, 95%CI: 0.79% - 4.20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening program in China works well, but the revision of the program is necessary </plain></SENT>
