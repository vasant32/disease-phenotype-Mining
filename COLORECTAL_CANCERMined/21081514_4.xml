<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="15862">CCN</z:chebi> genes encode secreted extracellular matrix proteins cysteine rich-61 (Cyr61), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> overexpressed (Nov) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are involved in diverse cellular functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of these factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> has produced conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, research has focused on molecular biomarkers to indicate progression of a disease or the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of CTGF and Cyr61 genes and proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression was compared with various clinicopathological parameters including Dukes' stage and TNM stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined the in vitro effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> on Cyr61 and CTGF expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> significantly reduced CTGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (p&lt;0.01) in HT29 and Caco-2 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cyr61 was induced (p&lt;0.01) in HT29 cell lines but significantly reduced (p&lt;0.01) in Caco-2 cell lines under hypoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High levels of CTGF and Cyr61 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression was reduced in more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancers</z:e> (Dukes' C vs Dukes' A and B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between CTGF protein expression and advancing Dukes' stage (p&lt;0.01), T stage (p&lt;0.01) and lymph-node involvement (p&lt;0.05), but there was no significant association between Cyr61 expression and clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Upregulation of Cyr61 and CTGF gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> suggests they have a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598935" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour initiation</z:e> or development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the genes are not as highly expressed in advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, suggesting their role may be important at an early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These genes maybe used as early biomarkers to risk-stratify patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> alters the expression of these genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine whether targeting these genes would be useful in future therapy </plain></SENT>
