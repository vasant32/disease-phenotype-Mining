<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> variant macroH2A1 has two splice isoforms, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, with tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although macroH2A1.1 is mainly found in differentiated, nonproliferative tissues, macroH2A1.2 is more generally expressed, including in tissues with ongoing cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistently, studies in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> have demonstrated a strong correlation between macroH2A1.1 levels and proliferation, which is not the case for macroH2A1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to assess the differential regulation and predictive potential of macroH2A1 isoforms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that macroH2A1.1 mRNA was down-regulated in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples compared to matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue, whereas macroH2A1.2 was up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the protein level, down-regulation of macroH2A1.1 correlated significantly with patient outcome (P = 0.0012), and loss of macroH2A1.1 was associated with a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the course of Caco-2 cell differentiation, macroH2A1.1 was up-regulated at both the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, whereas macroH2A1.2 was slightly down-regulated at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level and stable at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were accompanied by an antiproliferative phenotype exhibiting features of cellular senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of macroH2A1.1 in vitro was characterized by a phenotype associated with cell growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that macroH2A1 isoforms are differentially regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, reflecting the degree of cellular differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, macroH2A1.1 expression predicts survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, thus identifying macroH2A1.1 as a novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> biomarker </plain></SENT>
