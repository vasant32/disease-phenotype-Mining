<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process-high pressure homogenization technique has been developed to prepare Nano-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of Nano-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> and TPT was investigated against MCF-7, HCT-8, and PC-3 cell lines using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, antitumor activity in vivo were evaluated against HCT-8 xenograft model, and the dose dependent toxicity in vivo during the treatment were investigated by body weight changes and relative organ weight variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Nano-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> presents about 6 times in vitro cytotoxicity active than TPT against cell lines MCF-7, nearly the same in vivo antitumor activity with TPT and lower toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results confirm that Nano-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> is a novel potential formulation with high antitumor efficacy and low toxicity </plain></SENT>
