<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rates of guideline-consistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in Appalachian Kentucky are suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening knowledge, specifically regarding recommended screening intervals, and receipt of screening among residents of rural Appalachian Kentucky </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Residents of Appalachian Kentucky (n = 1096) between the ages of 50 and 76 years completed a telephone survey including questions on demographics, health history, and knowledge about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening between November 20, 2009, and April 22, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although 67% of respondents indicated receiving screenings according to guidelines, respondents also demonstrated significant knowledge deficiencies about screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of respondents were unable to identify the recommended screening frequency for any of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accuracy about the recommended frequency of screening was positively associated with screening adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced educational approaches have the potential to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening adherence in this population and reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality in this underserved region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses play a critical role in patient education, which ultimately may increase screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To fulfill this role, nurses should incorporate current recommendation about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening into educational sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Advanced practices nurses in rural settings should also be aware of the increased vulnerability of their patient population and develop strategies to enhance awareness about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the accompanying screening tests </plain></SENT>
