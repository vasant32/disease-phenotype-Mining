<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DLC2 is closely related to deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> 1 (DLC1) and is located at chromosome 13q12.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of DLC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has been found in a wide range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there are no available data on the expression status of DLC2 in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels of DLC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the correlation between DLC2 expression and clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To this end, real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were employed to detect DLC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and pericarcinomatous intestinal tissue (PCIT) specimens, which were obtained from 102 Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent surgical resection between October 2010 and February 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the correlations between DLC2 expression and the clinicopathological parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues had significantly lower levels of DLC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> compared with PCITs (P&lt;0.05); however, the protein expression levels were not significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and PCITs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of DLC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were significantly correlated with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> TNM stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, DLC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were also correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histopathological degree (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results suggest that the downregulated expression of DLC2 participates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, invasion and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results imply that DLC2 is be a potential prognostic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
