<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to systemic therapy, the aim of RFA is to achieve complete local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control in an attempt to provide long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article we discuss the available evidence regarding the treatment of patients with unresectable CRLM, focusing on RFA in conjunction with modern systemic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that the available evidence in the existing literature is limited, and often consists of level 2 and 3 evidence, thereby hampering any firm conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, RFA seems superior to chemotherapy alone in patients with liver-only disease amenable for RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of RFA and chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be feasible and safe, lending support to the concept of RFA followed by chemotherapy, in order to reduce local recurrence rates and prolong survival </plain></SENT>
