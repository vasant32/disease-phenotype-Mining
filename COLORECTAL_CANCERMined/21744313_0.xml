<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with HNPCC, first-degree relatives of subjects with HNPCC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and average risk subjects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were included prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total colonoscopy with chromoendoscopy using <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> 0.5% and magnification in the right colon (cecum and 20 cm of the ascending colon) and in the left colon (rectum) was performed; loss of expression of MLH1 and MSH2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in confirmed ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight of the 119 ACF detected by endoscopy were biopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14 of the 38 specimens (36.8%), ACF were confirmed by histology (Cohen's kappa, 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects with HNPCC, ACF were identified more frequently in the right segment of the colon than in the left (73.1% vs. 26%); in contrast, ACF predominated in the left segment of the colon (89.3% vs. 10.6%) in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a loss of MLH1 expression in ACF in subjects with HNPCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In HNPCC, we found a greater density of ACF in the right colon, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, greater density in the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACF present loss in the expression of DNA MMR protein and can be used as an early marker in patients with a risk of HNPCC in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> appears to be accelerated </plain></SENT>
