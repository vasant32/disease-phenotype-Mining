<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> receptor β (ERβ) is the predominant ER in the colorectal epithelium, whose expression is greatly reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent in vitro studies suggested that ERβ may suppress <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No research was reported whether ERβ can be used as therapeutic agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, ERβ gene constructed into adenoviral (Ad) vectors was used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> HCT-116 cells alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of ERβ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> in HCT-116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results indicated that, although Ad-ERβ alone had no effect on the proliferation of HCT-116 cells, the combination of Ad-ERβ with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apparently apoptotic induction effects may partly explain the cytotoxicity of the two agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the study of ERβ on migration and invasion of HCT-116 cells demonstrated that overexpression of ERβ significantly decreased cell migration and increased invasion of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antitumor efficacies of ERβ as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> were further investigated on HCT-116 tumor bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated that both Ad-ERβ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> individually inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination group showed the highest inhibitory efficiency compared with other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that combined administration of Ad-ERβ with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8772">raloxifene</z:chebi> represents a promising <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
