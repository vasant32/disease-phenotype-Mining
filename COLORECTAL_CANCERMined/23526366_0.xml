<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we described the development of a home made ELISA test based on recombinant human P53 protein produced in Pichia pastoris and used as antigen for the detection of serum p53-Abs in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human P53 was secreted as a His-tagged protein by recombinant KM71 strain (Kα21) via the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> signal α of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating type gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recombinant P53-His was able to detect p53-Abs in 23.4 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum p53-Abs correlated significantly with surgical treatment (P = 0.007), relapse during follow-up (P = 0.036), depth of invasion (P = 0.036) and the level of CA19-9 (P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis showed that patients negative for serum p53-Abs exhibited a prolonged disease free survival period (P log rank = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the secreted recombinant human P53-His produced in P. pastoris seems to be a useful antigen for detection of serum p53 Abs in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
