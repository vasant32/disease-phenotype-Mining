<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A two-stage model for evaluating both trial-level and patient-level surrogacy of correlated time-to-event endpoints has been introduced, using patient-level data when multiple clinical trials are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the associated maximum likelihood approach often suffers from numerical problems when different baseline hazards among trials and imperfect estimation of treatment effects are assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we propose performing the second-stage, trial-level evaluation of potential surrogates within a Bayesian framework, where we may naturally borrow information across trials while maintaining these realistic assumptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posterior distributions on surrogacy measures of interest may then be used to compare measures or make decisions regarding the candidacy of a specific endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We perform a simulation study to investigate differences in estimation performance between traditional maximum likelihood and new Bayesian representations of common meta-analytic surrogacy measures, while assessing sensitivity to data characteristics such as number of trials, trial size, and amount of censoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we present both frequentist and Bayesian trial-level surrogacy evaluations of time to recurrence for overall survival in two meta-analyses of adjuvant therapy trials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With these results, we recommend Bayesian evaluation as an attractive and numerically stable alternative in the multitrial assessment of potential surrogate endpoints </plain></SENT>
