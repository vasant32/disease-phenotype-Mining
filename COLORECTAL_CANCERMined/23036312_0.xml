<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Psychosocial interventions for next-of-kin to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients are effective in improving quality of life issues, although there are conflicting results in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most studies have evaluated the effects of PEP for mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> groups but there is little knowledge about how next-of-kin to a person treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> describe their experience of life and their experience of participating in a PEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study used a qualitative descriptive design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual, open-ended interviews with each of the 18 next-of-kin, of persons receiving treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, who participated in a PEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the experiences described by the next-of-kin to a person treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the subtheme; Facing a personal challenge was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From their described experiences of participating in a PEP, the subtheme Obtaining New Insights and Perspectives emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One main theme was finally identified; Finding a Wider Horizon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study illuminates the importance of integrating the next-of-kin/family in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings from this study can be used to plan future interventions for next-of-kin to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as it offers possibilities to understand the next-of-kin's situation and experience from participating in a PEP </plain></SENT>
