<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study describes the management of patients with bilobar colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective collection of data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CRLM who were considered for staged resection (n= 85) from January 2003 to January 2011 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent one hepatic resection were considered to have had a failed staged resection (FSR), whereas those who underwent a second or third hepatic resection to produce a cure were considered to have had a successful staged resection (SSR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete follow-up and dates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were obtained from the Government of Quebec population database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median survival was 46 months (range: 30-62 months) in the SSR group and 22 months (range: 19-29 months) in the FSR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of 5-year survival were 42% and 4% in the SSR and FSR groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 19 patients who remained alive at the last follow-up date belonged to the SSR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients in whom staged resection for bilobar CRLM is feasible, surgery would appear to offer benefit </plain></SENT>
