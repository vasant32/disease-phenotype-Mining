<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of study is to clarify the expression patterns and potential function of PLK1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Fifty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> samples were collected and arranged onto a tissue array and the expression of PLK1 were detected by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics and expression of PCNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of PLK1 in 9 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells lines was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot, then SW1116 cells lines were treated with PLK1 siRNA and the efficiency was examined by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transwell test was applied to detect the migration and invasion capability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells by counting the number of cells passing through the membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Annexin-V Kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PLK1 was positively expressed in 73.2% (41/56) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> tissues, but in only 3.6% (2/56) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, and was associated with Duke's stage (P&lt;0.01), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (P&lt;0.01), invasion extent (P&lt;0.05) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastasis</z:e> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of PLK1 was correlated with expression of PCNA (R=0.553, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PLK1 was inhibited in SW1116 cells by treating with PLK1 siRNA oligos, which resulted in a decreased number of cells passing through the membrane as compared with control groups (P&lt;0.01) at 24 hours after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was inhibited from 48 hours after transfection, while cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was induced from 72 hours after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PLK1 could be a progression marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and PLK1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> can inhibit migration and invasion capability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells SW1116, suggesting that PLK1 might be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic strategies targeting PLK1 may be a new approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
