<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, microRNA profiles were evaluated in the transformation of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> to discover new molecular markers for identifying a <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in colonoscopy biopsy tissues where the presence of stromal invasion cells is not detectable by microscopic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of 723 human microRNAs was measured in laser capture microdissected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumours</z:e> from 133 snap-frozen surgical colorectal specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three well-known classification algorithms were used to derive candidate biomarkers for discriminating <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR was then used to validate the candidates in an independent cohort of macrodissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal tissue samples from 91 surgical resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biomarkers were applied to differentiate <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in 58 colonoscopy biopsy tissue samples with stromal invasion cells undetectable by microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One classifier of 14 microRNAs was identified with a prediction accuracy of 94.1% for discriminating <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical tissue samples, a combination of miR-375, miR-424 and miR-92a yielded an accuracy of 94% (AUC=0.968) in discriminating <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This combination has been applied to differentiate <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in colonoscopy biopsy tissues with an accuracy of 89% (AUC=0.918) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has found a microRNA panel that accurately discriminates <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in colonoscopy biopsy tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This microRNA panel has considerable clinical value in the early diagnosis and optimal surgical decision-making of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
