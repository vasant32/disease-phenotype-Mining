<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objective is to elucidate the effects of oral bifid triple viable probiotics among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing radical colorectal resection were randomly assigned to 3-day (days -5 to -3) preoperative probiotics (group A, n = 30) or placebo (group B, n = 30) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The alteration of intestinal flora was evaluated by fecal cultures of Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium longum and intestinal fungi; the gut barrier function by serum endotoxins and D-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acids</z:chebi> and the immune and stress responses by peripheral blood immunoglobins, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Postoperative infections</z:e> were documented physically, radiologically and microbiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inverted Bifidobacterium/Escherichia ratios were preoperatively and postoperatively present in group B (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bifidobacterium counts increased significantly, whereas Escherichia counts decreased significantly on postoperative days 3 to 5 (P &lt; 0.05), along with reversing the Bifidobacterium/Escherichia ratio inversion until postoperative days 3 to 5 in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group A also had lower levels of endotoxins, D-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acids</z:chebi>, serum interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein but higher levels of serum IgG and sIgA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) than group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidences of postoperative infectious complications were 3.3% to 6.7% and 3.3% to 30% in groups A and B (overall, 10.0% versus 33.3%, P &lt; 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The preoperative oral bifid triple viable probiotics minimize the postoperative occurrence of infectious complications, with possible mechanisms attributed to the maintenance of the intestinal flora and restriction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> translocation from the intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was representative of the enhancement of systemic/localized immunity and concurrent attenuation of systemic stress response </plain></SENT>
