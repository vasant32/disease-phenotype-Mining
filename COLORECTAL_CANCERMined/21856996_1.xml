<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from epidemiologic studies, however, have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some factors that coexist with tea consumption, such as cigarette smoking, may confound or modify the association between tea consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the association between green tea consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in a population-based prospective cohort study, the Shanghai Men's Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis included 60,567 Chinese men aged 40-74 years at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During âˆ¼5 years of follow-up, 243 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regular green tea consumption (ever drank green tea at least three times per week for more than six consecutive months) was associated with reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in non-smokers (multivariable-adjusted HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk decreased as the amount of green tea consumption increased (P(trend) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each 2 g increment of intake of dry green tea leaves per day (approximately equivalent to the amount of tea in a tea bag) was associated with a 12% reduction in risk (HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found among smokers (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.66-1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that regular consumption of green tea may reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk among non-smokers </plain></SENT>
