<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Consumption of red and processed meat (RPM) is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and high intakes of these foods increase the risks of several leading <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use newly derived estimates of habitual meat intakes in UK adults to assess potential co-benefits to health and the environment from reduced RPM consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Modelling study using dietary intake data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of British Adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: British general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Respondents were divided into fifths by energy-adjusted RPM intakes, with vegetarians constituting a sixth stratum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GHG emitted in supplying the diets of each stratum was estimated using data from life-cycle analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A feasible counterfactual UK population was specified, in which the proportion of vegetarians measured in the survey population doubled, and the remainder adopted the dietary pattern of the lowest fifth of RPM consumers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Reductions in risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and GHG emissions, under the counterfactual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Habitual RPM intakes were 2.5 times higher in the top compared with the bottom fifth of consumers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Under the counterfactual, statistically significant reductions in population aggregate risks ranged from 3.2% (95% CI 1.9 to 4.7) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women to 12.2% (6.4 to 18.0) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in men, with those moving from the highest to lowest consumption levels gaining about twice these averages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expected reduction in GHG emissions was 0.45 tonnes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> equivalent/person/year, about 3% of the current total, giving a reduction across the UK population of 27.8 million tonnes/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced consumption of RPM would bring multiple benefits to health and environment </plain></SENT>
