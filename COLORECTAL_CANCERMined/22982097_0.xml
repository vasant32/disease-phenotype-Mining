<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined long-term time trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality in 6 European countries to determine when the reduction began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed mortality data from the national statistical offices of the United Kingdom (England and Wales), France, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland during the past 66 to 107 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were made available by the national statistical offices of the 6 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-specific rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were plotted against the period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as period-age contours, and against the period of birth, as cohort-age contours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Long-term time trends in mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the rectum</z:e> and colon each increased among generations born from 1800 to 1880, and then decreased among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent generations, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 countries analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar temporal patterns also were observed when data from men and women were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The birth cohort patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality resemble those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Time trends of mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, in 6 European countries, are associated with birth cohort patterns: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality decreased among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> generations since 1880 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patterns indicate that in addition to the use of screening colonoscopy, other factors, such as changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo>, may have affected mortality </plain></SENT>
