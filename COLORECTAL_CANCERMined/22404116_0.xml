<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phytochemicals and identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> of purple-shoot tea extract (PTE) were significantly higher than that of ordinary tea, especially the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35218,38697">anthocyanins</z:chebi> (surpassed by 135-fold) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16366,38695">anthocyanidins</z:chebi> (surpassed by 3.5-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PTE inhibited the proliferation of COLO 320DM (IC(50) = 64.9 μg/mL) and HT-29 (IC(50) = 55.2 μg/mL) by blocking cell cycle progression during the G(0)/G(1) phase and inducing apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting indicated that PTE induced cell cycle arrest by reducing the expression of cyclin E and cyclin D1 in COLO 320DM and the upregulation of p21 and p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in HT-29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cells treated with PTE also indicated the cleavage of PARP, activation of caspase 3, and an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that PTE is a potential novel dietary agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
