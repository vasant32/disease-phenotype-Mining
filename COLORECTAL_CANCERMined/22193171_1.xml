<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors measured plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D in healthy volunteer examinees who underwent total colonoscopy in Tokyo, Japan, 2004-2005, and evaluated its influence on colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, both alone and in interaction with VDR polymorphisms, which correspond to the FokI and TaqI restriction sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main analysis of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D included 737 cases and 703 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lowest quintile of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, only the highest was related to a significantly decreased odds ratio of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (odds ratio = 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.45, 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but the lowest quintile of dietary calcium intake presented similarly reduced odds ratios (odds ratio for the highest = 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.47, 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note, the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was modified by the TaqI polymorphism of the VDR gene (P(interaction) = 0.03) but not by dietary calcium intake (P(interaction) = 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations highlight the importance of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
