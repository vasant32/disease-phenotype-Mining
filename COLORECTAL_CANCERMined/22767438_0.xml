<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the last decade, studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) demonstrate dysregulation of miRNAs expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For instance, miR-650 has been implicated in gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tumorigenicity; however, the role of miR-650 remains unknown in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis to examine the miR-650 expression level in 248 <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> and 120 paracarcinomatous liver (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>) tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlations between miR-650 expression level and the clinicopathological characteristics (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> tumorigenicity) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of miR-650 played in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> was investigated by Q-PCR, western blot, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that miR-650 expression was significantly increased in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients and significantly associated with the patients' age (P = 0.0019), differentiation capability (P = 0.0108), and also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage (P = 0.0069) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we compared the expression level of both ING4 and miR-650 in 122 <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients by western blot and real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical result showed a significant negative correlation between them (r(s)  = -0.2011, P = 0.0264) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transfection and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> test suggested that miR-650 decreased the expression of ING4 and stimulate liver cells proliferation significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggested that miR-650 is correlated with the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> and is involved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> process by inhibiting the expression of ING4 </plain></SENT>
