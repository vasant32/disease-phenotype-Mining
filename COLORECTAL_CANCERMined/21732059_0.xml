<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the functional role of LCMR1 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, LCMR1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens was quantified by using the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of downregulation of LCMR1 by lentivirus-mediated small hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a higher expression of LCMR1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue in comparison with adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LCMR1 gene was effectively knocked down in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> RKO and DLD-1 cells that infected with lentivirus delivering shRNA against LCMR1, which resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and augmentation of G0/G1 phase proportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the tumorigenicity of RKO cells was also dramatically inhibited after LCMR1 was knocked down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that LCMR1 promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell growth, and lentivirus-mediated silencing of LCMR1 may contribute to the gene therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
