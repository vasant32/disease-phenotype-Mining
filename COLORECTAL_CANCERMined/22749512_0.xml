<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a set of indicators to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention programs in the high-risk population and to implement them in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> to confirm their feasibility and validity in identifying areas for improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search was performed and consensus techniques were applied with experts linked to the prevention programs in the distinct autonomous regions in Spain to propose a conceptual model for the evaluation and indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Users' opinions were introduced through focus groups for the proposed set of indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> experts participating in the consensus meetings and Delphi study evaluated the importance of each indicator (from 1 to 10) and their degree of agreement (agree strongly, agree with modifications, or eliminate this indicator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expert consensus was considered to have been reached when 80% strongly agreed or agreed with the inclusion of the indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the implementation phase, we included users (with advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or a familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) attending the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Information was obtained from computerized medical histories and clinical documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, health professionals linked to the program were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To calculate each indicator, its formula was computed and the indicator was then compared with a standard previously agreed on by the experts in the first phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expert consensus was reached in 30 indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the implementation phase, 21 feasible indicators that showed the greatest simplicity and validity in identifying areas for improvement were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these, two measured aspects related to accessibility, seven measured patient-centered care, five measured continuity of care, one measured patient safety and four evaluated clinical effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, eight of the 17 indicators achieved the previously agreed standard of quality of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The robustness and importance of the proposed set of indicators is supported by the wide participation of experts from distinct specialties and the adequate agreement reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The present study serves to identify areas for improvement in the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Periodic measurement of these indicators will allow the changes produced in this program and their utility to be evaluated and will aid assessment of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention programs in the high-risk population </plain></SENT>
