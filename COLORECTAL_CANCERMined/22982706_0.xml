<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Filipino Americans underutilize life-saving screening tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, resulting in late stage of diagnosis and poor survival relative to other racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Education regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening and distribution of free fecal occult blood test (FOBT) kits are evidence-based interventions that can significantly increase screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this community will only benefit if the intervention is broadly disseminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the feasibility of promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in Filipino American community settings working with community health advisors, and the practicality of conducting one-on-one or small group education, in addition to passing out free FOBT kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty community health advisors from 4 organizations engaged in recruitment and education activities with 132 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Community health advisors consistently completed screening questionnaires to establish eligibility and kept logs of FOBT distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, they did not consistently record eligible participants who did not consent to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Process checklists that indicated what information was covered in each educational session and postsession follow-up logs were partially completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants reported receipt of intervention components and receipt of screening at 4-month follow-up and reported high acceptability of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pilot study established the feasibility of working with community health advisors to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in Filipino American community settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Findings informed the design of a dissemination trial that is currently ongoing with regards to monitoring recruitment, intervention implementation and follow-up and allowing flexibility regarding one-on-one or small group education </plain></SENT>
