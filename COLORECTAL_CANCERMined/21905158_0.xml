<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients (mean age = 57.3 years [SD = 9.7], 57% female, mean = 2.99 years post-diagnosis [SD = 1.64]) who had completed treatment for stages 1-3 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were randomized to telephone counseling to support PA (PA group, n = 20) or contact control (control group, n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PA group participants received 3 months of PA counseling (based on the transtheoretical model and the social cognitive theory) delivered via telephone, as well as weekly PA tip sheets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments of PA (Seven-day Physical Activity Recall [7-day PAR] and Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors [CHAMPS]), submaximal aerobic fitness (Treadwalk test), motivational readiness for PA, and psychosocial outcomes were conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Objective accelerometer data were collected at the same time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PA group reported significant increases in minutes of PA at 3 months (7-day PAR) and caloric expenditure (CHAMPS) compared with the control group, but the group differences were attenuated over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PA group showed significant improvements in fitness at 3, 6, and 12 months versus the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvements in motivational readiness for PA were reported in the PA group only at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant group differences were found for <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, self-reported physical functioning, and quality of life at 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A home-based intervention improved survivors' PA and motivational readiness at 3 months and increased submaximal aerobic fitness at 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
