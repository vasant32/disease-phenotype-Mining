<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine whether <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (CIN) phenotype, determined by the severity of CIN, can predict survival for stages II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status in 1,103 patients (training [n = 845] and validation [n = 258] sets with stages II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LOH ratio was defined as the frequency of LOH in chromosomes 2p, 5q, 17p, and 18q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the LOH ratio, non-MSI high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were classified as CIN high (LOH ratio ≥ 33%) or CIN low (LOH ratio &lt; 33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CIN-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were subclassified as CIN high (mild type; LOH ratio &lt; 75%) or CIN high (severe type; LOH ratio ≥ 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used microarrays to identify a gene signature that could classify the CIN phenotype and evaluated its ability to predict prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CIN high showed the worst survival (P &lt; .001), whereas there was no significant difference between CIN low and MSI high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CIN high (severe type) showed poorer survival than CIN high (mild type; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that CIN phenotype was an independent risk factor for disease-free and overall survival, respectively, in both the training (P &lt; .001 and P = .0155) and validation sets (P &lt; .001 and P = .0076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis also revealed that survival was significantly poorer in those with the CIN-high than in the CIN-low gene signature (P = .0203) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a validation of 290 independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (GSE14333), the CIN-high gene signature showed significantly poorer survival than the CIN-low signature (P = .0047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CIN phenotype is a predictive marker for survival and may be used to select high-risk patients with stages II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
