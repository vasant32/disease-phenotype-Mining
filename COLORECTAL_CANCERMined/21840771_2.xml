<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had stage II/III <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-1, and adequate organ function, and received preoperative (cohort A) or adjuvant (cohort B) treatment at physician discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) as an intravenous infusion (IVCI) 225 mg/m(2)/d on days 1-42, bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously (I.V.) on days 1 and 15 (cohort A), or every 2 weeks (cohort B), with radiation therapy to 50.4 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgery (cohort A) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> (cohort B), FOLFOX6 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) and bevacizumab were administered for 4 months and then bevacizumab was given alone for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (cohort A = 35; cohort B = 31) were enrolled from August 2006-April 2009: median age was 57 years; male patients, 62%; ECOG PS 0, 75%; stage II/III, 31%/69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cohort A, the complete pathologic response (pCR) rate was 29% (11% microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e>, 49% gross disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients did not undergo surgery (toxicity, 2 patients; progressive disease, 1 patient; patient decision, 1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One- and 2-year DFS for cohorts A/B were 85%/not reached and 97%/89%, respectively (median survival not reached for either cohort) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequent grade 3/4 toxicity included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (A cohort, 14%; B cohort, 29%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (A cohort, 14%, B cohort, 23%), mucositis (A cohort, 23%, B cohort, 0%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (A cohort, 6%, B cohort, 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other serious toxicity included bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pelvic infection</z:e> (cohort A, 1 patient each), bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (2 patients), anal wound dehiscence (1 patient), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0581363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">perianal infection</z:e> (2 patients), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000143'>rectovaginal fistula</z:hpo> (1 patient) (cohort B), without treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in either cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab can be added to standard preoperative and adjuvant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> in most patients with expected and manageable toxicity and may increase treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
