<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microsimulation models are an important tool for estimating the comparative effectiveness of interventions through prediction of individual-level disease outcomes for a hypothetical population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To estimate the effectiveness of interventions targeted toward high risk groups, the mechanism by which risk factors influence the natural history of disease must be specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose a method for evaluating these risk factor assumptions as part of model-building </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used simulation studies to examine the impact of risk factor assumptions on the relative rate (RR) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence and mortality for a cohort with a risk factor compared to a cohort without the risk factor using an extension of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-SPIN model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared the impact of changing age at initiation of screening colonoscopy for different risk mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific risk factor mechanisms, the RR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality decreased (towards one) with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of change in RRs across age groups depended on both the risk factor mechanism and the strength of the risk factor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality attenuated the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific risk factors on the RR of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> when both were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For each risk factor mechanism, earlier initiation of screening resulted in more life years gained, though the magnitude of life years gained varied across risk mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simulation studies can provide insight into both the effect of risk factor assumptions on model predictions and the type of data needed to calibrate risk factor models </plain></SENT>
