<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, NTP/NCTR has demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> in F344 rats chronically exposed to Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera) non-decolorized whole leaf extract (AVNWLE) in drinking water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The morphological and molecular pathways of AVNWLE-induced large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> in the F344 rats were compared to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (hCRC) literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defined histological criteria were used to compare AVNWLE-induced large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> with hCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The commonly mutated genes (Kras, Ctnnb1, and Tp53) and altered signaling pathways (MAPK, WNT, and TGF-β) important in hCRC were evaluated within AVNWLE-induced large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation of the large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> indicated eight of twelve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (Ads) and four of twelve <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (Cas) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of eight Ads and four Cas identified point mutations in exons 1 and 2 of the Kras gene (two of eight Ads, two of four Cas), and in exon 2 of the Ctnnb1 gene (three of eight Ads, one of four Cas) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No Tp53 (exons 5-8) mutations were found in Ads or Cas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular pathways important in hCRC such as MAPK, WNT, and TGF-β signaling were also altered in AVNWLE-induced Ads and Cas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the AVNWLE-induced large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> in F344 rats share several similarities with hCRC at the morphological and molecular levels </plain></SENT>
