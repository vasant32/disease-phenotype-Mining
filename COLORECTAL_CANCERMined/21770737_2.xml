<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a T to G substitution (SNP309) in the promoter of MDM2 was identified and associated with increased MDM2 expression and a significantly earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies evaluated the association between SNP309 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in diverse populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimation of association between MDM2 SNP309 and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we performed a meta-analysis of 3347 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 3102 controls from eight published case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the variant genotype was associated with a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (GT vs. TT: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.06-1.35; p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the stratified analyses, significantly increased risks were found among Asian populations (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.10-1.50; p=0.002) and population-based studies (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.03-1.34; p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although some bias could not be eliminated, this meta-analysis suggested that the MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism is a low-penetrance risk factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, particularly among Asians </plain></SENT>
