<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Hook knife has been also used in combination with the Dual knife, depending on the location of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have had recent opportunities to use a scissors-type SB knife Jr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared outcomes of colorectal ESD performed with the Dual knife in combination with the SB knife Jr versus the Hook knife </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although the Hook knife was shown to be a very useful auxiliary device for colorectal ESD, the SB knife Jr. yielded better results than the Hook knife in terms of complete en block resection and avoidance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of the Dual knife with the SB Knife Jr shows good potential for improving complete en bloc resection rate and safety of technically difficult colorectal ESD </plain></SENT>
