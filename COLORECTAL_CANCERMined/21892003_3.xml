<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the pharmacogenomic profile of irinotecan-induced gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity by the novel drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter (DMET) microarray genotyping platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six mCRC patients who had undergone to irinotecan-based chemotherapy were enrolled in a case (patients experiencing ≥ grade 3 gastrointestinal, (GI) toxicity) - control (matched patients without GI toxicity) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference of SNP genotype distribution was found in the case versus control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The homozygous genotype C/C in the (rs562) ABCC5 gene occurred in 6/9 patients with GI toxicity versus 1/17 patients without GI toxicity (P=0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The homozygous genotype G/G in the (rs425215) ABCG1 was found in 7/9 patients with GI toxicity versus 4/17 patients without GI toxicity (P=0.0135) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous genotype G/A in the 388G&gt;A (rs2306283) OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 was found in 3/9 patients with grade ≥ 3 GI toxicity vs. 14/17 patients without GI toxicity (P=0.0277) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells was genotyped by DMET Plus chip on Affymetrix array system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genotype association was calculated by Fisher's exact test (two tailed) and relevant SNPs were further analyzed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have identified 3 SNPs mapping in ABCG1, ABCC5 and OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 transporter genes associated with GI toxicity induced by irinotecan in mCRC patients expanding the available knowledge of irinogenomics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The DMET microarray platform is an emerging technology for easy identification of new genetic variants for personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
