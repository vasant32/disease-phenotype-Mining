<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isothiocyanates (ITC) have been recently shown to inhibit development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in many experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression through binding to 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) of target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs are regulated by natural agents, ITCs included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our study, using global expression profiling based on TaqMan Low-Density Arrays, we identified 3 common miRNAs (miR-155, miR-23b, miR-27b) regulated by ITCs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47807">sulforaphane</z:chebi>, iberin) in colonic epithelial cell lines NCM460 and NCM356 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In silico predictions allowed us to find 9 relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localized within the 3'UTRs of genes (AGTR1, TNFAIP2, PRKCB, HSPA9, RABGAP1, DICER1, ADAM19, VWA5A, and SIRT5) targeted by these ITC-related miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we observed that homozygous CC genotype of DICER1, rs1057035, was significantly associated with decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (odds ratio = 0.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.25-0.95, P = 0.036) when compared to TT homozygote genotype; also, the C allele tended to have a protective effect (P = 0.072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study showed that miRNAs could be involved in chemoprotective effects of natural agents; their function alteration through SNPs in their binding sites and flanking regions presents a new class of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
