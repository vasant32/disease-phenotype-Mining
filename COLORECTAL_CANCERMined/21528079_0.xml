<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients who underwent colorectal resection were identified for inclusion in this study, of which 46 had positive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 46 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IIIcolorectal cancer</z:e>, 16 had ECI at positive nodes and 8 had disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and pathological features of these cases were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, the number of positive lymph nodes and depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion were significantly associated with the presence of ECI at positive nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only ECI was a predictor of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recurrence-free interval differed significantly among patients with ECI at positive nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ECI at metastatic nodes can identify which cases are at high risk of short-term disease recurrence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
