<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe the PA level, its correlates, and association with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors identified from the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry treated between 1998 and 2007 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survivors completed validated questionnaires on PA, distress, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels were calculated by summing the time spent on walking, bicycling, gardening and sports (≥3 MET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to study which socio-demographic and clinical factors were associated with MVPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we examined associations between MVPA and physical and mental HRQoL, and whether these associations were mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cross-sectional data of 1371 survivors (response: 82%) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants were 69.5 (SD 9.7) years old, 56% were male, and survival duration was 3.9 (SD 2.5) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants self-reported on average 95.5 (SD 80.3) min on MVPA per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Younger age, male sex, being employed, non-smoking, lower BMI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>), chemotherapy treatment and having no co-morbidities were associated with higher MVPA (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MVPA was positively associated with physical HRQoL (regression coefficient of total association (c) = 0.030; se = 0.004) after adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> mediated this association between MVPA and physical HRQoL (44% mediated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The association between MVPA and mental HRQoL was not statistically significant after adjusting for socio-demographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related factors (c = 0.005; se = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors, clinical factors including the absence of co-morbidity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> site and chemotherapy treatment were associated with higher MVPA, in addition to several socio-demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Higher MVPA was associated with higher physical HRQoL but not with mental HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> and distress mediated the association between MVPA and HRQoL </plain></SENT>
