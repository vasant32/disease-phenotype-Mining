<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated the surface characteristics and vascular patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> according to growth type by means of magnifying narrow-band imaging (NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred ninety-seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> larger than 10 mm (204 tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> [TAs], 199 frankly invasive intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> to shallow invasive submucosal [M/SM-s] <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and 94 deeply invasive submucosal [SM-d] <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> were classified according to growth type as follows: polypoid type, n = 224; laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-granular (LST-G) type, n = 133; and LST-non-granular (LST-NG) type, n = 140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface and vascular patterns were evaluated in relation to histology and growth type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The absent and irregular surface patterns were observed in approximately 40 % of the SM-d <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the polypoid and LST-G type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unclear surface pattern was more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the LST-NG type than in those of other growth types, regardless of histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among TAs and M/SM-s <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, the dense vascular pattern was most frequent in polypoid type, the dense and corkscrew vascular patterns were most frequent in the LST-G type, and the honeycomb and avascular and/or fragmentary patterns were most frequent in the LST-NG type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The avascular and/or fragmentary vessel pattern was more frequent in SM-d <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> than in TA and M/SM-s <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, regardless of growth type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A part of LST-NG was difficult to identify the NBI magnifying surface pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although NBI magnifying findings were almost same in each type lesion in SM-d lesion, those of LST-NG were different from those of LST-G and polypoid type in M/SM-s lesion </plain></SENT>
