<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are currently no useful preclinical evaluations to guide the decision-making process for tailored therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the advantages and limits of a conventional in vitro chemosensitivity test with those of a panel of biomolecular markers in predicting clinical response to different drugs used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>-derived PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh surgical biopsy specimens were obtained from 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TS, TP, DPD, MDR1, MRP-1, MGMT, BRCA1, ERCC1, GSTP1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> gene expression levels were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An in vitro chemosensitivity test was used to define a sensitivity or resistance profile to the drugs used to treat each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression levels of the genes analyzed were generally poorly related to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TS and ERCC1 expression was inversely related to response to 5-FU-and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant predictivity in terms of sensitivity but poor predictivity of resistance (56.2%) (P = .037) were observed for ERCC1 expression (90%), and high predictivity of resistance (100%) but very low predictivity of sensitivity (40%) (P = .014) were registered for TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best overall and significant predictivity was observed for chemosensitivity test results (62.5% sensitivity and 89% resistance; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity and resistance to drugs used in vivo was better defined by the chemosensitivity test than by biomarker expression </plain></SENT>
