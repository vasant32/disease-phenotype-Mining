<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy can be an extension of the care provided by a family physician to help substantially reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Family physicians trained in colonoscopy can provide access to care in rural and medically underserved areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Department of Family Medicine and the Colorado Area Health Education Center (AHEC) developed the Endoscopy Training for Primary Care (ETPC) program to teach primary care physicians to perform colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The program included online didactic education, a formal endoscopy simulator experience, and proctoring by a current endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants completed a baseline and follow-up survey assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening knowledge and the effectiveness of the endoscopy training for ongoing screening activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To date, 94 practitioners and health professional students have participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one (97%) completed the online didactic portion of the training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five participants (77%) were physicians or medical students, and the majority (64%) was in the field of family medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The year 4 (2011) follow-up cohort was comprised of 62% respondents working in an urban background and 26% in rural communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many participants remain in a queue for proctoring by a trained endoscopist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several participants are successfully performing a significant number of colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ETPC program showed success in recruiting a large number of physicians and students to participate in training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The program enhanced perceptions about the value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> screening and providing screening endoscopy in primary care practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Providing sites for simulation training throughout Colorado provided opportunity for providers in rural regions to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As a result of this training, thousands of patients underwent testing to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Future research relating to colonoscopy training by family physicians should focus on quality assurance and determining best methods for procedural competence </plain></SENT>
