<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still difficult for medical practitioners to integrate these new kinds of data into clinical routine, since available information is growing rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate how a blend of manual curation and automated data extraction and evidence synthesis can be used to generate a 'living review', a summarization of current evidence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> classification, corresponding genetic markers, genetic tests and treatment options that can be used by clinicians to refine treatment choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a classical review, this automated 'living review' offers the opportunity of automatically updating core content when available data changes, making it easier to keep an overview of the best current evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discuss some of the findings we made while creating a prototype of a 'living review' for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
