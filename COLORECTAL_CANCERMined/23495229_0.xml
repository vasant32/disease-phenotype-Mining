<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SCOPE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi> (RSV) has been proposed to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>; nevertheless, these preventive effects are controversial since RSV pharmacokinetics studies show a low bioavailability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent clinical trials show that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and receiving oral RSV have high levels of RSV conjugates in the colorectum, mainly RSV-3-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (R3S), RSV-3-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>, and RSV-4'-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their potential biological activity has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study thus investigated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines whether RSV main metabolites retain anticarcinogenic properties as their parental molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assays and cell cycle analysis were performed to study the effect of RSV, R3S, RSV-3-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>, or RSV-4'-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> alone or of a mixture of the three metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>R3S inhibits <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells proliferation and an accumulation of cells in S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mixture induced a synergistic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This process was associated with an induction of DNA damages and apoptotic process, which allowed sensitization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells to the anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Altogether, our data provide significant new insight into the molecular mechanism of RSV and support the notion that despite low bioavailability in vivo, RSV biological effects could be mediated by its metabolites </plain></SENT>
