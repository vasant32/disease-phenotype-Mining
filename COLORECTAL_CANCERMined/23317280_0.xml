<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> showed that mutations of genes in the PIK3CA/AKT and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>/RAF/MEK pathways, two major signalling cascades downstream of EGFR, might predict resistance to EGFR-targeted agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the frequencies of mutations in these key EGFR pathway genes in Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a high-throughput mass-spectrometric based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> gene mutation profiling platform to detect 22 mutations of the PIK3CA, AKT1, BRAF, EGFR, HRAS, and KRAS genes in 120 Chinese women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen mutations were detected in 12 (10%) of the samples, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were invasive ductal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (two stage I, six stage II, three stage III, and one stage IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These included one mutation (0.83%) in the EGFR gene (rs121913445-rs121913432), three (2.5%) in the KRAS gene (rs121913530, rs112445441), and nine (7.5%) in the PIK3CA gene (rs121913273, rs104886003, and rs121913279) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in the AKT1, BRAF, and HRAS genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six (27.3%) of the 22 genotyping assays caused mutations in at least one sample and three (50%) of the six assays queried were found to be mutated more than once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the EGFR pathway occurred in a small fraction of Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, therapeutics targeting these potential predictive markers should be investigated in depth, especially in Oriental populations </plain></SENT>
