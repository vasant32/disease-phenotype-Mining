<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the number of Canadians being screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is rising, only 40% of Canadians aged 50 years or older reported they had engaged in faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening as recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The notion of 'partnerships' that is inclusive of physicians, individuals at average-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and influential family members is receiving more attention in primary health care literature and policy on promoting health maintenance behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge there are no studies that have taken a tripartite approach in describing perspectives of these three key stakeholders on the role of family in promoting adherence to FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to address the gap in understanding the perspectives of primary care physicians, individuals at average-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and family on family role in promoting adherence to FOBT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We employed a qualitative design and conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 physicians, 27 patients at average-risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and 19 family members or friends from urban and rural Manitoba, Canada between October 2008 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using content analysis and constant comparative techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While physicians described a clear role for family in managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease or dealing with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or serious illness, they identified barriers in working with family to promote FOBT screening: lack of time, privacy and confidentiality concerns, and family dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, patients and family described instrumental, emotional, informational, and appraisal roles that family play in promoting FOBT outside medical encounters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening is based on supportive 'patient-physician' dialogue that is separate from assistive 'patient-family member' relations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is required to explore social support mechanisms involving family members outside medical encounters that hold promise in boosting self-efficacy, overcoming barriers, and gaining positive reinforcement for individuals at average-risk when making the decision to engage in FOBT </plain></SENT>
