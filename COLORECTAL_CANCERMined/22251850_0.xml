<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Is this referral or selection bias justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A prospective database of resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> at a single centre was retrospectively analysed to compare the outcome in patients aged â‰¥75 years (group E) with those aged &lt;75 years (group Y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method with Cox regression modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1443 resections, 151 (10.5%) in group E were compared with 1292 (89.5%) in group Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two groups were matched apart from higher American Society of Anesthesiology scores (P=0.001) and less use of chemotherapy (P=0.01) in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative morbidity and 90-day mortality were higher in the elderly compared with the younger group (32.5%vs 21.2%, P=0.02, and 7.3%vs 1.3%, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the last 5 years, mortality in the elderly improved and was no longer significantly different from that of the younger patients [n=2/76 (2.6%) vs n=9/559 (1.6%); P=0.063] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival was similar in groups E and Y for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific (41.4%vs 41.6%, P=0.917), overall (37.0%vs 38.2%) and median (44.1 months vs 43.6 months, P=0.697) survival respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the elderly liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity with as good a prospect of survival as for younger patients </plain></SENT>
