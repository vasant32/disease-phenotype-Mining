<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of dietary factors that could contribute to this high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine major dietary patterns and its relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in four hospitals in Tehran city of Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 71 patients (35 men and 36 women, aged 40-75 years) with incident clinically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and 142 controls (70 men and 72 women, aged 40-75 years) admitted to hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1709246" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-neoplastic diseases</z:e> were recruited and interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dietary data were assessed by 125-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between dietary patterns and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two major dietary patterns (Healthy pattern and Western pattern) were derived using principal component analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each dietary pattern explained 11.9% (Healthy pattern) and 10.3% (Western pattern) of the variation in food intake, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounding factors, the Healthy dietary pattern was significantly associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR= 0.227; 95% CI=0.108-0.478) while an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was observed with the Western dietary pattern (OR=2.616; 95% CI= 1.361-5.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Specific dietary patterns, which include healthy and western patterns, may be associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This diet-disease relationship can be used for developing interventions that aim to promote healthy eating for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Iranian population </plain></SENT>
