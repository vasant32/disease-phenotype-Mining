<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its diagnostic and prognostic value is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the relationship between ANXA2 expression, clinicopathological characteristics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> recurrence, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate ANXA2 expression in 150 matched samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and recurrence were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent factors contributing to survival and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and liner correlation analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of ANXA2 expression for clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ANXA2 was found to be strongly expressed in poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001), late stage (p = 0.020) and lymph node positivity (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ANXA2 expression was significantly related to recurrence (p &lt; 0.001) and survival (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model indicated that ANXA2 expression (p &lt; 0.001, HR=1.366, 95%CI 1.232-1.515) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location (p = 0.039, HR=1.891, 95%CI 1.034-3.456) were independent factors in predicting overall survival while ANXA2 expression (p &lt; 0.001, HR=1.445, 95%CI 1.222-1.709) were independent factors predicting recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (AUC=0.768, 95%CI=0.642-0.894) and liner correlation analysis suggested ANXA2 was suitable for the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ANXA2 is a biomarker with diagnostic and prognostic potential for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>. © 2013 The Authors </plain></SENT>
