<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined temporal trends in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Chile from 1983 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We analysed the mortality database in Chile from 1983 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were selected using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9/10 codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants according to sex, age group and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> - colon (CC) or rectal (RC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rates were adjusted by a direct method using the WHO-2000 standard population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time trends were assessed with Prais-Winsten regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ReSULTS: There were 26,250 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (75.7% for CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from CC (57.6%) in women than in men, who had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from RC (51.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The crude CC mortality rate increased by 116% (from 3.6 to 7.8), while the overall RC rate increased by 71% (from 1.4 to 2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, a significant increase in mortality rate was found for CC (coefficient 0.09, 95% CI 0.08-0.11, P &lt; 0.001) and RC (coefficient 0.02, 95% CI 0.009-0.04, P = 0.002) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In women, this increase was significant for CC (coefficient 0.03, 95% CI 0.005-0.05; P = 0.02), but not for RC (coefficient -0.007, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.005, P = 0.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The crude mortality rate from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has doubled in Chile in this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After adjustment of mortality rates, it appears that much of this increase is due to the aging population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, part of this increase could be explained by other factors </plain></SENT>
