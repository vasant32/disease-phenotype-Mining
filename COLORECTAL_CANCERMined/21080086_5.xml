<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may have prognostic and therapeutic significance; however, currently available techniques are not optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the combination of invisible near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent light and ex vivo injection could solve remaining problems of SLN mapping in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The FLARE imaging system was used for real-time identification of SLNs after injection of the NIR lymphatic tracer HSA800 in the colon and rectum of (n = 4) pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 SLN mappings were performed in vivo and ex vivo after oncologic resection using an identical injection technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Guided by these results, SLN mappings were performed in ex vivo tissue specimens of 24 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients undergoing resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lymph flow could be followed in real-time from the injection site to the SLN using NIR fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In pigs, the SLN was identified in 32 of 32 (100%) of SLN mappings under both in vivo and ex vivo conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically, SLNs were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 24) using the ex vivo strategy within 5 min after injection of fluorescent tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, 9 patients showed lymph node involvement (N1 disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, a 3-mm mesenteric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was found adjacent to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-negative SLN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current pilot study shows proof of principle that ex vivo NIR fluorescence-guided SLN mapping can provide high-sensitivity, rapid, and accurate identification of SLNs in colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This creates an experimental platform to test optimized, non-FDA-approved NIR fluorescent lymphatic tracers in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
