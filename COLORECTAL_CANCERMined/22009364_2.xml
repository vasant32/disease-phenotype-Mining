<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature-based meta-analysis was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted from randomized trials for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); the event-based risk ratio was derived for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses to look for interactions according to KRAS status and chemotherapy association regimens were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight trials (6609 patients) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction according to KRAS status was found for PFS (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> vs mutant, P = .001) and response rate (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> vs mutant, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of an anti-EGFR MoAb to first-line chemotherapy increased PFS in the KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> population (HR, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.99; P = .03), and had a detrimental effect in the KRAS mutant population (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.25; P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the probability of achieving a response was evident in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients (relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33; P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this population, the interaction in response rate according to adopted chemotherapy favored irinotecan-containing regimens (P = .01), and at meta-regression analysis the relative increase in response rate was significantly related to PFS (P = .00001) and OS (P = .00193) benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of an anti-EGFR MoAb to first-line chemotherapy produces a clear benefit in response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This advantage is restricted to KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients and translates into a small benefit in PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At present, irinotecan-based backbone chemotherapy could be a preferable option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The correlation between activity and survival parameters corroborates the hypothesis that anti-EGFR MoAbs might be more suitable for patients needing tumoral shrinkage </plain></SENT>
