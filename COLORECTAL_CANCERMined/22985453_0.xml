<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, but thromboprophylaxis (TP) is underutilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current guidelines do not make specific recommendations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and provide minimal guidance for the ambulatory setting, although emerging evidence suggests TP may be warranted during chemoradiotherapy or in the extended post-operative phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A survey of Australasian colorectal surgeons was therefore performed to assess current TP practice and attitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An online survey was sent to 204 surgeons who were members of the Colorectal Surgical Society of Australia and New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight surgeons (63%) completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most surgeons consult available guidelines, and where recommendations are made, current practice is in line with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lack of data, lack of ownership, logistical issues and an absence of guideline recommendations currently prevent surgeons from instituting TP in the neoadjuvant treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four per cent of surgeons currently prescribe TP after hospital discharge; those that do not, cite logistical issues as the main constraint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> risk during various treatment phases are required and should be promulgated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistical barriers to adopting TP in the ambulatory setting should be addressed </plain></SENT>
