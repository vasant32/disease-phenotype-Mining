<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biennial faecal occult blood test screening has been shown to significantly reduce mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wolverhampton was the first centre involved in the NHS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (NHS BCSP) in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the life-year saving by increasing the uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in Wolverhampton by 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from the first complete round of the NHS BCSP and 5-year survival figures based on the Dukes staging system, a simple model was developed on Microsoft Excel using the population of Wolverhampton aged between 60 and 74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: If uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in Wolverhampton increased from 50% to 70%, one extra person would be alive at 5 years and the 5-year survival rate would increase by 0.85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening by 20% in Wolverhampton would have a modest survival benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to determine whether or not this is cost-effective </plain></SENT>
