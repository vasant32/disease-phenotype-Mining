<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysfunction of the circadian clock is involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, and altered expression of some clock genes has been found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of core clock genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to examine ARNTL1, CLOCK, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, Timeless (TIM), TIPIN, and CSNK1? expression levels in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and matched apparently healthy mucosa of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in the expression levels of CLOCK (p=.778), CRY1 (p=.600), CSNK1 (p=.903), and TIPIN (p=.136) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As to the clinical and pathological features, a significant association was found between low CRY1 expression levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mucosa and age (p=.026), and female sex (p=.005), whereas high CRY1 expression levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mucosa were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> location in the distal colon (p?=?.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, high TIM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mucosa were prevalent whenever proximal lymph nodes were involved (p= .013) and associated with TNM stages III-IV (p=.005) and microsatellite instability (p=.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly poorer survival rates were evidenced for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with lower expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue of PER1 (p=.010), PER3 (p= .010), and CSNKIE (p=.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, abnormal expression levels of core clock genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue may be related to the process of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and exert an influence on host/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> interactions </plain></SENT>
