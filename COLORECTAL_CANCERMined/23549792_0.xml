<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and quality assessment of studies of cost-effectiveness of fDNA as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tool (compared with no screening and other screening modalities), and identified key variables that impinged on cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination for cost-effectiveness studies of fDNA-based screening, published in English by September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Studies that undertook an economic evaluation of fDNA, using either a cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis, compared with other relevant screening modalities and/or no screening were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional inclusion criteria related to the presentation of data pertaining to model variables including time horizon, costs, fDNA performance characteristics, screening uptake, and comparators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 369 articles were initially identified for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven articles were included in the final review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STUDY APPRAISAL: Data was abstracted on key descriptor variables including screening scenarios, time horizon, costs, test performance characteristics, screening uptake, comparators, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quality assessment was undertaken using a standard checklist for economic evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies cited by cost-effectiveness articles as the source of data on fDNA test performance characteristics were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven cost-effectiveness studies were included, from the USA (4), Canada (1), Israel (1), and Taiwan (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Markov models (5), a partially observable Markov decision process model (1) and MISCAN and SimCRC (1) microsimulation models were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies took a third-party payer perspective and one included, in addition, a societal perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comparator screening tests, screening intervals, and specific fDNA tests varied between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>fDNA sensitivity and specificity parameters were derived from 12 research studies and one meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Outcomes assessed were life-years gained and quality-adjusted life-years gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>fDNA was cost-effective when compared with no screening in six studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Compared with other screening modalities, fDNA was not considered cost-effective in any of the base-case analyses: in five studies it was dominated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> alternatives considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses identified cost, compliance, and test parameters as key influential parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In general, poor presentation of "study design" and "data collection" details lowered the quality of included articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Although the literature searches were designed for high sensitivity, the possibility cannot be excluded that some eligible studies may have been missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Reports (such as Health Technology Assessments produced by government agencies) and other forms of grey literature were excluded because they are difficult to identify systematically and/or may not report methods and results in sufficient detail for assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of the available (albeit limited) evidence, while fDNA is cost-effective when compared with no screening, it is currently dominated by most of the other available screening options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Cost and test performance appear to be the main influences on cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
