<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Immunohistochemical and molecular studies have suggested an oncogenic role for JCV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002672'>gastrointestinal carcinomas</z:hpo>, but at least in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, the data are far from being unambiguous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two large series of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were analysed for the expression of JCV large T Antigen (T-Ag) with a panel of five antibodies, and for the presence of T-Ag DNA sequences using two PCR systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intense nuclear staining was observed in 54/116 (46%) colorectal, and in 92/234 (39%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo>, using the PAb416 monoclonal antibody against large T-Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, PAb416-positivity was directly related to the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> and a more advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage, and inversely related to proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> site and the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo>, the glandular histotype, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, a low frequency of MSI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, and a worse prognosis were significantly associated with PAb416 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, at both these sites, PAb416 expression was significantly associated with p53 nuclear accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No positivity was obtained with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other four anti-T-Ag-antibodies, and molecular analysis failed to demonstrate the presence of JCV DNA sequences in tested cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our immunohistochemical and molecular results do not support the idea that JCV T-Ag has a role in gastrointestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is possible that PAb416, besides binding the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein, may cross-react with a hitherto undefined protein whose expression is associated with a distinct pathological profile and, at least in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo>, with worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
