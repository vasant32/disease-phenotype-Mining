<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The trafficking protein particle complex 4 (TRAPPC4) is implicated in vesicle-mediated transport, but its association with disease has rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored its potential interaction with ERK2, part of the ERK1/2 complex in the Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase/ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-activated Protein Kinase (ERK-MAPK) pathway, by a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST) pull-down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further investigation found that when TRAPPC4 was depleted, activated ERK1/2 specifically decreased in the nucleus, which was accompanied with cell growth suppression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of TRAPPC4 promoted cell viability and caused activated ERK1/2 to increase overall, but especially in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TRAPPC4 was expressed more highly in the nucleus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic epithelium or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> which corresponded with nuclear staining of pERK1/2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that TRAPPC4 may regulate cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by interaction with ERK2 and subsequently phosphorylating ERK1/2 as well as modulating the subcellular location of pERK1/2 to activate the relevant signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
