<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is also one of the most treatable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, resulting in significant numbers of survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the impact of surviving treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on health related quality of life is important for the patients, clinicians and policy makers, and may differ in different cultures and populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate the Malaysian versions of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> quality of life instruments among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: This is a cross sectional multi centre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hospitals were included, the University of Malaya Medical Centre, the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre and Hospital Tuanku Jaafar Seremban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Malaysian citizens and permanent residence were studied and demographic and clinical information obtained from hospital records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Quality of life Core 30, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> CR29, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> LMC 21 were used and an observer assessment of performance obtained with the Karnofsky Performance Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were translated into three most commonly spoken languages in Malaysia (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil), then administered, scored and analyzed following the developers' guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ethical approval was obtained from the participating centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tests of reliability and validity were performed to examine the validity of these instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The result of pilot testing shows that the use of the Malaysian versions of EORTC QLQ C30, CR29 instruments is feasible in our sample of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Instructions for completion as well as questions were well understood except the questions on the overall quality of life, overall health status and sexual activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus we anticipate obtaining good psychometric properties for the instruments at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
