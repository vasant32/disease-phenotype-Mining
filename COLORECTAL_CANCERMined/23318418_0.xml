<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perturbations in this intricate host-microbe cross-talk have been reported to be associated with uncontrolled epithelial cell growth and thus potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development by mechanisms which are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore generated transgenic mice carrying a constitutively active TLR4 (CD4-TLR4) linked to an intestinal epithelial cell-specific promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo analysis of transgenic crypt-villus organoid cultures revealed an increased proliferative capacity and a lowered cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) expression in these organoids compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Introducing the CD4-TLR4 transgene into APC(Min/+) mice (CD4-TLR4-APC(Min/+)), a model of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, resulted in a dramatic drop in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load as compared with control APC(Min/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Intestinal tumors</z:e> from CD4-TLR4-APC(Min/+) mice displayed reduced Cox-2 protein, elevated interferon Î² expression and increased caspase-3 activity, which correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data reveal that host microbiota-mediated signal transduction via TLR4 in intestinal epithelial cells is far more complex than what is previously reported.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.581 </plain></SENT>
