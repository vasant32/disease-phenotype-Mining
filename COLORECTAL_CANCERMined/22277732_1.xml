<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated plasma samples from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) cohort to determine quantitative differences in plasma proteins between subjects subsequently diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and matched controls that remained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free during the period of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proteomic analysis of WHI samples collected before diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> resulted in the identification of six proteins with significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated concentrations in cases compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proteomic analysis of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines showed that five of the six proteins were produced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1 (MAPRE1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), leucine-rich alpha-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (LRG1), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were individually assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 58 pairs of newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples and controls and yielded significant elevations (P &lt; 0.05) among cases relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A combination of these four markers resulted in a receiver operating characteristics curve with an area under the curve value of 0.841 and 57% sensitivity at 95% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This combination rule was tested in an independent set of WHI samples collected within 7 months before diagnosis from cases and matched controls resulting in 41% sensitivity at 95% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A panel consisting of CEA, MAPRE1, IGFBP2, and LRG1 has predictive value in prediagnostic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> plasmas </plain></SENT>
