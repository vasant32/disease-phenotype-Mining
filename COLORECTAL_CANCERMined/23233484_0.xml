<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of PAK4 or PAK1 inhibited the proliferation of mutant KRAS or BRAF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dependence on PAK4 or PAK1 protein for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell proliferation was independent of PAK4 or PAK1 protein expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant KRAS HCT116 colorectal cells were the most sensitive to PAK4 or PAK1 knockdown resulting in the potent inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation as well as the formation and proliferation of HCT116 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> spheroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This inhibition of proliferation did not correlate with inhibition of RAF/MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In HCT116 cells, knockdown of PAK4 or PAK1 caused changes to the actin cytoskeleton resulting in reduced basal spread and cell elongation and increased cell rounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cytoskeletal rearrangements seemed to be independent of LIMK/cofilin/paxillin phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAK4 or PAK1 knockdown initially induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> in HCT116 cells followed by cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) with the pharmacologic inhibitor <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-737 increased effector caspase activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and reduced cell survival with PAK4 or PAK1 knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support a role for the PAKs in the proliferation of mutant KRAS-driven colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells via pathways not involving RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling </plain></SENT>
