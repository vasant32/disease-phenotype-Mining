<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: New methods to enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening rates are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The web offers novel possibilities to educate patients and to improve health behaviors, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence supports the efficacy of health communications that are targeted and tailored to improve the uptake of recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified unscreened women at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from the scheduling databases of obstetrics and gynecology practices in 2 large health care systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants consented to a randomized controlled trial that compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening uptake after receipt of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening information delivered via the web or in print form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants could also be assigned to a control (usual care) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women in the interventional arms received tailored information in a high- or low-monitoring Cognitive Social Information Processing model-defined attentional style </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening participation at 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 904 women were randomized to the interventional or control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 4 months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening uptake was not significantly different in the web (12.2%), print (12.0%), or control (12.9%) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Attentional style had no effect on screening uptake for any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some baseline participant factors were associated with greater screening, including higher income (P = .03), stage of change (P &lt; .001), and physician recommendation to screen (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A web-based educational intervention was no more effective than a print-based one or control (no educational intervention) in increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates in women at average risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Risk messages tailored to attentional style had no effect on screening uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In average-risk populations, use of the Internet for health communication without additional enhancement is unlikely to improve screening participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00459030 </plain></SENT>
