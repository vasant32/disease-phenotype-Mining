<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of survivin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases (HDACs) are often found over-expressed in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and have been implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HDAC inhibition induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in various transformed cell; however, the mechanisms by which this reduces cell viability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells remain unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We explored the actions of two HDAC inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) and sirtinol, in HT29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TSA and sirtinol induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibited cell proliferation in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are associated with the modulation of survivin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survivin promoter luciferase activity and Sp1, a transcription factor that contributes to survivin expression, were suppressed in cells exposed to TSA or sirtinol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TSA and sirtinol also activated p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of p38MAPK or AMPK signaling abrogated TSA and sirtinol's effects of decreasing cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survivin promoter luciferase activity in the presence of TSA or sirtinol was restored by AMPK dominant negative mutant or p38MAPK inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Sp1 binding to the survivin promoter region decreased while p63 binding to the promoter region increased after TSA or sirtinol exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report a p38MAPK- and AMPK-mediated downregulation of survivin, and its functional correlation with decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell viability in the presence of HDAC inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>p63 and Sp1 may also contribute to TSA and sirtinol actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study delineates, in part, the underlying mechanisms of TSA and sirtinol in decreasing survivin expression and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell viability </plain></SENT>
