<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the high-resolution positional mapping of the gene underlying the Ccs3 effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using phenotype/genotype correlation in a series of 33 AcB/BcA recombinant congenic mouse strains, as well as in groups of backcross populations bearing unique recombinant chromosomes for the interval, and in subcongenic strains, we have delineated the maximum size of the Ccs3 physical interval to a ∼2.15 Mb segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This interval contains 12 annotated transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of positional candidates in A and B6 identified many either low-priority coding changes or non-protein coding variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a unique copy number variant (CNV) in intron 15 of the Nfkb1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CNV consists of two copies of a 54 bp sequence immediately adjacent to the exon 15 splice site, while only one copy is found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-susceptible A </plain></SENT>
