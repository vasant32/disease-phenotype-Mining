<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative risk assessment by questionnaires survey and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) were used to proceed preliminary screening among people aged 40 to 74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electronic colonoscopy was applied to examine the whole colon and rectum among identified high-risk subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detected cases received treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> or non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early diagnosis rate and incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were evaluated and compared with those before screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: With application of optimized sequential screening schemes, various types of colorectal lesions were detected in 1 117 subjects, including 69 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 701 cases of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 211 cases of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The early diagnosis rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was increased by 58.19%, and its incidence rate also decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The optimized sequential screening scheme is simple, economical, efficient in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening of general population </plain></SENT>
