<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively collected database of 302 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic liver resection at our institution between 2003 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients undergoing laparoscopic first/second-stage hepatectomy for bilobar CRLMs (male/female 6:2; median age, 64 years) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first stage consisted of laparoscopic clearance of the left lobe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with no postoperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent portal vein embolization or ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median interval between first- and second-stage hepatic resections was 89 days (range, 36-123 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second-stage hepatectomy with right lobar clearance (open, n=5; laparoscopic, n=2; laparoscopic to open, n=1) was associated with no mortality and an operative morbidity rate of 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesions</z:e> were judged to be minimal or absent during the second-stage procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications included intra-abdominal collection (n=2), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> requiring re-operation (n=1), and bile leak (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>R0 resection was obtained in 7 of 8 cases after first-stage resection and in 8 of 8 cases after second-stage resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients (38%) died from disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 5 patients, 4 are disease-free at a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 9-27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The well-recognized advantages of laparoscopy may play a favorable role in the management of patients with bilobar CRLMs candidate for a two-stage resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The first-stage laparoscopic clearance of the left lobe could progressively become the "gold standard." Laparoscopic second-stage hepatectomy should be limited to selected cases </plain></SENT>
