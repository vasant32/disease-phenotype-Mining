<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the yield of LS detection by routine molecular analyses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients until 70 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively included consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients ≤70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> specimens were analysed for microsatellite instability (MSI), immunohistochemical mismatch-repair protein expression and MLH1-promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> were classified as either: (a) likely caused by LS; (b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> microsatellite-unstable (MSI-H); or (c) microsatellite-stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors of LS were determined by multivariable logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 1117 CRC patients (57% males, median age 61 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (4.5%, 95% CI 3.4-5.9) were likely to have LS, and 71 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (6.4%, 95% CI 5.1-8.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients likely to have LS (70%) were aged &gt; 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A molecular profile compatible with LS was detected in 10% (15/144) of patients aged ≤50, in 4% (15/377) of those aged 51-60 and in 3% (20/596) of patients &gt; 61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> cases, patients likely to have LS were significantly younger (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7-8.7) and more often had right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (OR 14, 95% CI 6.0-34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, molecular screening for LS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients ≤70 years leads to identification of a molecular profile compatible with LS in 4.5% of patients, with most of them not fulfilling the age criterion (≤50 years) routinely used for LS assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Routine use of MSI testing may be considered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients up to the age of 70 years, with a central role for the pathologist in the selection of patients </plain></SENT>
