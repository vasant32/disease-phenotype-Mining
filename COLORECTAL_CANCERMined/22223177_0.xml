<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection (EPMR) is a widely accepted treatment for colorectal tumefaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, as it is associated with a significant recurrence rate, the technique remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate the risk factors for the local recurrence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> after EPMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population of our retrospective evaluation comprised 222 patients who had undergone EPMR from January 2002 to July 2007 and who had had at least 1 surveillance colonoscopy 3-6 months after the initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local recurrence was detected in 42 patients (19%) between 6 and 15 months after EPMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our multivariate analysis revealed that the resection of 5 or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> specimens, compared with fewer than 5, was 3 times more likely to result in local recurrence (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant correlation of local recurrence with lesion size, location, macroscopic type, or histology was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The removal of 5 or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> specimens is an independent risk factor for local recurrence after EPMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful colonoscopic surveillance should be performed after multiple piecemeal resection </plain></SENT>
