<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During the past 3 decades, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was at a low level in urban and rural populations in India, in comparison with figures observed in developed countries of North America and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the time trends of incidence and mortality, and the survival rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, as well, in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is an ecological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured is the incidence data extracted from selected Indian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in the volumes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence in 5 continents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low and stable incidence and mortality rates from colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancers</z:e> were observed in India in both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this low incidence rate was associated with a low 5-year relative survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the prevailing environmental factors and lifestyle, including a reduced consumption of <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi>, calories and fat-rich food, an increased consumption of vegetables and fruits, and an adequate physical activity with avoidance of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, are responsible for the low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the low survival, even for localized cases, suggests severe deficiencies in early diagnosis and effective treatment in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A strategy to control the disease in India, based on improving awareness of the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> while keeping the traditional lifestyle, and on investments in early diagnosis and adequate treatment should be implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, an organized, population-based screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may not prove cost-effective, given the low burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
