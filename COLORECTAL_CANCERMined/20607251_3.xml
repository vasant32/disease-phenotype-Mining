<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CXCR4 and its ligand, SDF-1alpha, play an important role in the targeted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed an expression of CXCR4 in clinical samples and showed that SDF-1alpha affected the expression of CXCR4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 388 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) who underwent surgery in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 2000 to 2004 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of CXCR4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was visualized by immunohistochemistry (anti-CXCR4 mAb, R&amp;D 12G5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HCT116, SW480, and SW620 cells were treated with SDF-1alpha in vitro and the CXCR4 proteins located in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments were separated and analyzed with western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of CXCR4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> was 35.6% and 36.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear but not cytoplasmic expression of CXCR4 was associated with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) and lymphovascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in multivariate analysis, nuclear expression of CXCR4 did not correlate with patients' outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro study, SDF-1alpha, stimulation of three colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> lines enhanced the CXCR4 nuclear expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Expression of the CXCR4 plays a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression and may be associated with SDF-1alpha stimulation </plain></SENT>
