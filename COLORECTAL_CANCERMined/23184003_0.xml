<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To derive a more precise estimate of the prognostic significance of MMP-2 overexpression, we reviewed published studies and carried out a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible articles were identified for the period up to March 2012 in electronic databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the correlation between MMP-2 overexpression and the prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, pooled hazard ratio (HR) and its 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) for poorer overall and progression-free survival were appropriately derived from fixed-effects or random-effects models using standard meta-analysis techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen studies with a total of 1,919 CRC patients stratifying overall survival (OS) and/or progression-free survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients by MMP-2 expression status were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten studies investigated the OS in a total of 1,612 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and five studies investigated the progression-free survival in a total of 508 patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined HR estimate for OS and progression-free survival was 1.74 (95 % CI, 1.34-2.26) and 1.35 (95 % CI, 1.07-1.80), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis further identified the prognostic role of MMP-2 overexpression in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MMP-2 overexpression is associated with poorer overall and progression-free survival in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
