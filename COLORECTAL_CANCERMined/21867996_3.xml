<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and two patients with potentially resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> underwent FDG PET-CT in addition to conventional imaging over an 18-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared to conventional imaging, with histological or clinico-radiological validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact on subsequent management was evaluated using information from clinico-radiological databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 102 patients (mean age 67 years, range 27-85 years), 94 had liver, five had isolated lung, and three had limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 31 patients (30%) PET-CT had a major impact on subsequent management, by correctly clarifying indeterminate lesions on conventional imaging as inoperable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> in 16 patients, detecting previously unsuspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> in nine patients, identifying occult second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> in three patients, and correctly down-staging three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PET-CT had a minor impact in 12 patients (12%), no impact in 49 cases (48%), and a potentially negative impact in 10 cases (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following PET-CT, 36 (35%) patients were no longer considered for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those remaining operative 45 of 66 (68%) underwent potentially curative metastatic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this cohort PET-CT saved 16 futile laparotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FDG PET-CT has a valuable role in selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> by improving staging accuracy and characterizing indeterminate lesions and helps triage patients to the appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
