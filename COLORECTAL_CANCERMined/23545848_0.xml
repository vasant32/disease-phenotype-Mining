<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The isolation of circulating stem cells involves cell sorting based on the presence of cell surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many surface markers such as CD133, c-Kit, SOX, OCT4 and TWIST have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined the expression of different stem cell markers and their variation in expression at different stages of the treatment process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples of EDTA blood were collected from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, and circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells were isolated for the analysis of the expression of stem cell markers using RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings were correlated with the response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad PrismÂ 5.03 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found in the expression levels of the markers CD133, SOX2, OCT4 and TWIST1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in c-Kit expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation in the expression levels of most of the markers was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD133, OCT4, SOX2 and TWIST1 had a predictive value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of this stem cell gene expression panel may be useful for predicting the response during the process of treatment, and the relative easy access to samples facilitates this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover the correlation between CD133 and TWIST1 expression may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> regrowth and metastatic relapse </plain></SENT>
