<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a high demand for cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers that would enable an early detection of asymptomatic and curable disease with high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> enriched for small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> was isolated from 100~sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 30 sera of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of miR-17-3p, miR-29a, miR-92a and miR-135b were determined using quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average expression levels of particular miRNAs were normalized to miR-16 levels and statistically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using Mann-Whitney U test, no significant differences were observed in miR-17-3p (P=0.18), miR-29a (P=0.14) and miR-92a (P=0.60) levels between sera of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of miR-135b in serum were too low to be quantified accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we tried to correlate expression levels of analyzed miRNAs to clinical-pathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only levels of mir-29a were correlated with the clinical stage (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of the other miRNAs were correlated neither with the clinical stage, nor with the grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, our results are contradictory to previous studies performed on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from Chinese population, providing an evidence against usage of serum miR-17-3p, miR-29a, miR-92a and miR-135b as new biomarkers for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
