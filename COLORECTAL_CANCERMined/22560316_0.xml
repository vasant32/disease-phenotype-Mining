<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Traditionally, for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with resectable synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, resections were performed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the safety and efficacy of simultaneous resection have been demonstrated in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes and economic implications of simultaneous and staged resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with resectable synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> treated between 1993 and 2010, constructing a decision tree comparing simultaneous and staged resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For generalizability, the analysis was conducted from a payer perspective, using costs derived from 2010 Medicare reimbursement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decision models incorporated the severity-refined DRG complications (complicating condition/major complicating condition) modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses used alternative models of DRG reimbursement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 144 patients analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty (41.7%) underwent simultaneous resection and 84 (58.3%) underwent staged resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival did not differ between the simultaneous and the staged cohorts (66.3 vs 65.6 months, respectively), nor did the overall complication rate (38.3% vs 40.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median total length of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the simultaneous cohort (8 vs 14 days; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the base model, the simultaneous strategy cost less than the staged strategy ($20,983 vs $25,298 per case)--a savings of 17.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses examining alternative severity-refined DRG reimbursements demonstrated potential cost savings, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 extreme sensitivity analysis, ranging from 9.8% to 27.3% favoring simultaneous resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous resection strategy was oncologically equivalent and more cost efficient for patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> presenting with resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A reduction in overall length of hospital stay was an associated benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future studies should explore the feasibility and clinical implications of policies to maximize the potential for simultaneous resection in this cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
