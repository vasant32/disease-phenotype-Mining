<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">Folic acid</z:chebi> is a potential drug that may prevent the progression of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and when to use are important healthy issues we focus on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study is to examine the effect of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> on the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and the optimal time <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> should be provided in a mouse-ICR model induced by 1, 2-Dimethylhydrazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, we investigated the gene expression profile of this model related to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Female ICR mouse (n=130) were divided into 7 groups either with the treatment of 1, 2-Dimethylhydrazine (20 mg/kg bodyweight) weekly or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (8 mg/kg bodyweight) twice a week for 12 or 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a 4 x 44 K Agilent whole genome oligo microarray assay, different gene expression among groups (NS, DMH, FA2, FA3) were identified and selected genes were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals with a supplementary of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> showed a significant decrease in the incidence, the maximum diameter and multiplicity of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were fewer <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> developed in the group of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation in pre-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> stage compared to group of post-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, about 1070 genes that were changed by 1, 2-Dimethylhydrazine can be reversed by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and 172 differentially genes were identified between the groups of pre- and post- <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> stage using microarray gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementary was significantly associated with the decrease risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And the subgroup of providing <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> was more effective than that with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940937" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
