<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine which patients could benefit from staged resections instead of simultaneous resection by identifying predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of synchronous, colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study involved 86 patients with synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> who underwent simultaneous resection of the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumor</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality, morbidity, and other surgical outcomes, including survival and hospitalization, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and for anastomotic leakage were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage were found in 55 (64%) and 18 (21%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and for anastomotic leakage were intraoperative blood loss and operation time &gt;8 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rate was 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of morbidity and that of anastomotic leakage seemed to be high after simultaneous resection for synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, especially when intraoperative blood loss or operation time increased greatly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Staged resections should be considered in cases in which excessive surgical stress from simultaneous resection of synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> would be expected </plain></SENT>
