<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UGT1A gene locus has been suggested to define tissue-specific glucuronidation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduced capacity of glucuronidation is correlated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to explore polymorphism of UGTlA gene in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cancerous and healthy tissues were obtained from selectedpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected and UGTlA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcriptions were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was prepared and UGTlA8 exon-1 sequences were amplified, visualized and purified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extracted DNA was subcloned and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-tailed Fisher's exact test, Odds ratios (ORs), confidence interval (CIs) and Logistics Regression Analysis were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: UGTlA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was reduced in cancerous tissues compared with healthy tissues from the same patient  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The UGTlA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of healthy tissue in study patients was lower than control  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of cancerous tissue was down-regulated in UGTlAl, 1A3, 1A4, lA6, 1A9 and up-regulated in UGTlA8 and UGTlAl0 UGT1A5 and UGT1A7 were not expressed in colonic tissue of either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of WT UGTlA8*1 was higher (p = 0.000), frequency of UGTlA8*3 was lowered in control group (p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expression of homozygous UGTlA8*1 was higher in control group (p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Higher frequency of both heterozygous UGTlA8*1/*3 and UGTlA8*2/*3 were found in study group (p = 0.000; p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was mainly related to the presence of polymorphic UGTlA8*3 alleles (p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regulation of human UGT1A genes is tissue-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Individual variation in polymorphic expressions of UGTlA gene locus was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of colonic tissue tested, whereas hepatic tissue expression was uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of UGTlA8 polymorphism exists in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>UGTlA8*1 allele is a protective factor and UGTlA8*3 allele is a risk factor </plain></SENT>
