<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six hundred seventy-five consecutive patients who underwent an elective resection for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from October 1999 to March 2004 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> and white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lymphocyte percentage on postoperative days 3 and 7 was significantly higher in patients without recurrence than in those with recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte percentage on postoperative day 7 differed the most between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 7, Stage II patients with lymphocyte percentage &gt;15% had significantly longer survival compared with the patients with lymphocyte percentage ≤ 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed lymphocyte percentage ≤ 15% on postoperative day 7 to be an independent prognostic factor, along with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> and serosal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that blood loss (&gt;250 ml) and postoperative complications were significant independent predictors of lymphocyte percentage ≤ 15% on postoperative day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte percentage ≤ 15% on postoperative day 7 is an independent prognostic factor for the patients undergoing a resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
