<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Single-site laparoscopy (SSL) represents an innovation whose wider adoption may be limited by technical challenges and a current dearth of outcomes data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive laparoscopic colorectal resections, including elective and emergent surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics and operative details were collected, and outcomes were analyzed for 30 days following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one single-site laparoscopic procedures were performed, with 12 (29%) being nonelective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgeries included seven right colectomies, eight sigmoidectomies, four ileocolectomies, five total colectomies, two low anterior resections, and two abdominoperineal resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent indication for surgery was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (31.7%), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (24.4%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> (24.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent of the patients had undergone previous abdominal surgery, with 64% of these having undergone previous laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One (2.5%) patient required conversion to multiple trocar laparoscopy, and five (12%) required conversion to laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean length of hospital stay was 4.2 days for SSL without a conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one anastomotic leak, no postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, no surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The readmission rate was 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SSL is safe when applied to unselected patients undergoing colorectal surgery, including those patients who have undergone a previous laparotomy </plain></SENT>
