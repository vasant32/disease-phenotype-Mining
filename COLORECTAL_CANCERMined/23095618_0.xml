<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine short- and long-term outcomes of major hepatectomy in patients with downstaged colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> considered initially unresectable (IU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Improvements in both surgical technique and efficacy of chemotherapy have increased the rate of resection for IU colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these patients needs to be reassessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2000 to 2011, 257 patients underwent major hepatectomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 87 (34%) IU patients required <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein occlusion</z:e> after chemotherapy downstaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients requiring less than 12 cycles and 12 or more cycles of chemotherapy before resection were defined as fast responders and slow responders, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with fast responders, slow responders had increased mortality (0% vs 19%, P = 0.003) and major morbidity rates (20% vs 55%, P &lt; 0.001) despite almost identical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and similar procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with increased major morbidity was the existence of a number of chemotherapy cycles of 12 or more (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.32, confidence interval [CI]: 1.69-16.7, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates for the entire population were 48%, 17.5%, and 13%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis found that slow responders (HR: 2.89, CI: 1.67-5.04, P &lt; 0.001) and patients without adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 2.38, CI: 1.33-4.35, P = 0.004) had a significantly decreased disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> slow responders postoperatively recurred within 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Liver resection in slow responders, that is, IU patients requiring 12 or more chemotherapy cycles and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein occlusion</z:e> to achieve resectability, is associated with poor short- and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients would probably benefit from more conservative strategies </plain></SENT>
