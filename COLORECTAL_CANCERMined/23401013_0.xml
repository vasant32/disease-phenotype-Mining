<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 459 colon (242 proximal and 167 distal), and 215 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases with follow-up ≥ 1 (median 11.1) year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Processed meat intake ≥60 vs. &lt;15 g/day was associated with significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsites with HRs (95% confidence interval, CI) of 1.69 (1.05-2.72) for proximal colon, 2.13 (1.18-3.83) for distal colon, and 1.71 (1.02-2.85) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
