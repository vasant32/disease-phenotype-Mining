<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the impact of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage (ETS) on progression-free- (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) treated within the AIO KRK 0104 trial as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, correlations of ETS with clinical characteristics and prognostic markers were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 121 patients were included into this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with cetuximab combined with either CAPIRI or CAPOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ETS at six weeks was defined as a relative change of ≥ 20% in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival times were compared between patients with ETS ≥ 20% versus no-ETS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ETS ≥ 20% was observed in 59% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these patients ETS ≥ 20% was associated with higher overall response rate (82% vs. 19%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, PFS (8.9 vs. 4.7 months, p &lt; 0.001) and OS (31.6 vs. 15.8 months, p = 0.005) were significantly superior in ETS ≥ 20% of patients compared to no-ETS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with KRAS mutant mCRC ETS ≥ 20% neither had an effect on PFS nor OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> correlated with the occurrence of ETS ≥ 20% (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> treated with cetuximab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy ETS ≥ 20% is an important predictor of favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
