<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the optimal categorization of extramural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits lacking residual lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) structure (EX) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The TNM classification system categorizes EX on the basis of their contour characteristics (the contour rule) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, pathological review of 1716 patients with stage I to III curatively resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were treated at 11 institutions (1994-1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 2242 patients from 9 institutions (1999-2003) were enrolled as a second cohort for validating results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EX were classified as isolated foci confined to vascular or perineural spaces (ie, lymphatic, venous, or perineural invasion) or as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nodules (ND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>N- and T-staging systems employing different categories for staging were compared in terms of their prognostic power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the diagnoses of extramural, discontinuously spreading lesions made by 11 observers from different institutions were assessed for interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EX were observed in 18.2% of patients in the first cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method of categorization of EX in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging has a stronger impact on N than T staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The N-staging system in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ND types were classified as N factor (the ND rule) could more effectively stratify the survival outcome than the contour rule (Akaike information criterion, 3040.8 vs 3059.5; the Harrell C-index, 0.7255 vs 0.7103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EX were observed in 16.9% of patients in the second cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistically, the ND rule was more informative than the contour rule for N staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Fleiss kappa coefficient for distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from EX (0.74) was lower than expected for complete agreement, and it decreased further to 0.51 when calculated for the judgment of ND with smooth contours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Classifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ND types as N factors irrespective of contours can simplify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging system by enhancing diagnostic objectivity, resulting in improved prognostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
