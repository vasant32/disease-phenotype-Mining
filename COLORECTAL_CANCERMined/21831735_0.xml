<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective study, we monitored the outcome of patients with a total colonoscopy at our hospital between 1994 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed the data of in-house follow-up colonoscopies, a national person registry and the morphological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> registry centralizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histopathological data at a national level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 8950 patients were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2032 (22.7%) patients had at least one colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> at index colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> prevalence was significantly higher in men than in women (27.9% vs. 17.4%, p&lt;0.001) and was increasing with age in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for a mean of 5.2 years and 19 had invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detected over 47,725 person years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate was 0.40 cases/1000 person years of follow-up (95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.62), and the standardized incidence ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Incidence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are low in the follow-up of patients having undergone a total colonoscopy in everyday practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After standard therapy of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at colonoscopy, there is little evidence for excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
