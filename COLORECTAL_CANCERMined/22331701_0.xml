<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-one patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, which had been treated by surgical resection, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One point was added for each element among four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related pathological factors of depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, venous invasion, and lymphatic invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PPS was determined by an aggregate of the points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There existed a significant difference both between survivals of patients with PPS 0 or 1 and 2 or 3 (P = 0.0005) and between survivals of patients with PPS 2 or 3 and 4 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PPS could be an easy and useful criteria to stratify prognosis of patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
