<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that the miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a expressions induced by PRL-3 are involved in the proliferation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microarray analysis and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were used to investigate the changes in miRNA expression due to the overexpression of PRL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transwell chamber invasion assays, CCK-8 proliferation assays and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference assays were used to explore the effects of PRL-3 on miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissues to evaluate the expression of PRL-3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that the overexpression of PRL-3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells induced the expression of miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a by activating STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, these microRNAs contributed to the increased proliferation and invasiveness of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive correlations between PRL-3 and these microRNAs were also observed in matched primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissues and metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a induced by PRL-3 contribute to the proliferation and invasion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
