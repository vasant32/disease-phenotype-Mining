<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is known that tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are involved in progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; however, little is known about the MET phospho-proteome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High resolution mass spectrometry was used to characterize immunoaffinity-purified, phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing tryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of the MET-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell model, DLD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 266 unambiguously identified pY sites spanning 168 proteins were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantification of mass spectrometry ion currents identified 161 pY sites, including many not previously linked to MET signaling, that were modulated in abundance by HGF stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overlay of these data with protein-protein interaction data sets suggested that many of the identified HGF-modulated phospho-proteins may be directly or indirectly associated with MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of pY sequence motifs indicated a prevalence of Src family kinase consensus sequences, and reciprocal signaling between Src and MET was confirmed by using selective small molecule inhibitors of these kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, using quantitative phospho-proteomics profiling, kinase modulation by ligand and inhibitors, and data integration, an outline of the MET signaling network was generated for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
