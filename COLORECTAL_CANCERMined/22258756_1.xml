<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since peritoneal lavage cytology has low sensitivity in detecting FPTC, our aim was to estimate the clinical relevance of FPTC detected using an approach based on multiple molecular techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of peritoneal lavage were collected from 27 gastric and 48 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FPTC recovery and detection from peritoneal washes was performed by cytological examination and immunomagnetic enrichment for epithelial cells followed by immunofluorescence analysis for epithelial marker EpCAM/CD326 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CEA and CK20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were quantified using a real-time qRT-PCR system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> the FPTC positivity rate acquired by cytology, immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR was 14.8%, 14.8%, and 78% and for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was 0%, 17%, and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>qRT-PCR positivity was correlated with a poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival and time-to-recurrence rates in both gastric and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial immunoenrichment and immunofluorescence analysis allows unequivocal identification of the FPTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The real time qRT-PCR showed higher sensitivity for the detection of CEA and CK20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and confirmed its prognostic value in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
