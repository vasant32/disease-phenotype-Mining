<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from The Netherlands <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8051 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> stage III ≥ 75 years diagnosed in 1997-2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trends in adjuvant chemotherapy administration were analysed and multivariable overall and disease-specific survival analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients ≥ 75 years who received adjuvant chemotherapy increased from 12%in 1997-2000 to 23% in 2007-2009 (P &lt; 0.0001), with a marked age gradient and large geographic variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival increased over time from 28% in 1997-2000 to 35% in 2004-2006 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy was the strongest positive predictor of survival in this retrospective study (hazard ratio = 0.5; 95% confidence interval: 0.4-0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There has been an increase in administration of adjuvant chemotherapy to elderly patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in The Netherlands since 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival of elderly patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> increased over time, at least partly due to stage migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The large effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in this study is likely to be associated with the selection of fitter patients for adjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
