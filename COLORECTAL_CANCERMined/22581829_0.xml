<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is associated with high recurrence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because deregulation of microRNAs is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development and recurrence, the expression levels of microRNAs can be a simple and reliable biomarker to detect postoperative early relapse, thereby helping physicians to treat high-risk patients more efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used microRNA arrays and observed that microRNA-93 had substantially different expression levels in early (recurrence within 12 months after surgery) and non-early relapse <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The replication study, which included 35 early relapse and 42 non-early relapse subjects, further confirmed overexpression of microRNA-93 in non-early relapse samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vitro and in vivo effects of microRNA-93 were investigated by examining cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as cell cycles, target-gene expression and xenograft in null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cellular studies showed that the overexpression of microRNA-93 inhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell proliferation and migration but not invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle studies also revealed that microRNA-93 caused an accumulation of the G2 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, microRNA-93 could not induce cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional studies showed that microRNA-93 could suppress CCNB1 protein expression leading to cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, microRNA-93 repressed expression of ERBB2, p21 and VEGF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are involved in cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA-93 also suppressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that microRNA-93 can inhibit <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and reduce the recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; these findings may have potential clinical applications for predicting the recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
