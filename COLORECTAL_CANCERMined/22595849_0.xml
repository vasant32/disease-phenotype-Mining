<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Favorable long-term outcomes have been reported for patients with good responses to chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, predictive factors for chemoradiotherapy responses can be useful for their applicability to risk-adaptive therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2, a key enzyme in ketogenesis, is associated with the responses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells to chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 was identified by a 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis -based proteome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was analyzed in 12 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells for associations with radiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> susceptibility by Western blotting, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">Bromide</z:chebi> assay, and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues obtained from 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> before chemoradiotherapy were analyzed by Western blotting for associations with chemoradiotherapy responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 was significantly correlated with intrinsic radiation resistance of 12 cancer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 expression was significantly affected by treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> or radiation depending on cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The artificial suppression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 did not result in the change of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> susceptibility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in multivariate analyses, hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> tissues was shown to be a significant predictive factor for chemoradiotherapy responses, as evaluated in terms of <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade and downstaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Overall findings in vitro showed that the expression level of hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 was highly variable depending on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell types, and it cannot directly affect on chemoradiotherapy responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism underpinning the association between hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase expression and chemoradiotherapy responses needs to be elucidated through future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 was associated with the effects of chemoradiotherapy on human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> synthase 2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> may be useful in predicting the responses to chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
