<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-six patients were randomly assigned into three groups according to the average plasma concentration of fluorouracil after three cycles of chemotherapy with the initial regimen of two weeks FOLFOX-4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> + leucovorin + fluorouracil) or FOLFIRI (irinotecan + leucovorin + fluorouracil): group 1 (plasma concentration of fluorouracil &lt; 25 ng/ml), group 2 (25 - 35 ng/ml) and group 3 (&gt; 35 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood samples were taken at 12 h after continuous infusion of fluorouracil in each cycle and the plasma concentration of fluorouracil was detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (about 5 am ± 1 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the drug plasma concentration, therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions in different fluorouracil plasma concentration arms was analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average plasma concentrations of fluorouracil of the three groups were (23.48 ± 1.95) ng/ml, (31.47 ± 2.33) ng/ml and (39.89 ± 3.87) ng/ml, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for therapeutic efficacy, the median OS of the groups 2 and 3 were 18.0 and 17.5 months, significantly higher than that in the group 1 (13.0 months, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PFS were 4.5, 7.5 and 8.0 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of adverse reactions, the incidences of bone marrow suppression, mucositis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in the group 3 were significantly higher than that in the first two groups (P = 0.02, P = 0.04 and P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The patients with local advanced and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, receiving fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, and with an average plasma concentration of fluorouracil between 25 - 35 mg/L have a better prognosis, and lower incidence of adverse reactions such as bone marrow suppression, mucositis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
