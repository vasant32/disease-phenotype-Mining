<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the associations of dietary PUFA intake on risk of colorectal adenomatous and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was a colonoscopy-based case-control study that included 3166 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-free control subjects, 1597 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> cases, and 544 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary PUFA intake was calculated from food-frequency questionnaires and tested for association by using unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The urinary <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) metabolite, which is a biomarker of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) production, was measured in 896 participants by using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: n-6 PUFAs were not associated with adenomatous or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> in either men or women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marine-derived n-3 PUFAs were associated with reduced risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in women only, with an adjusted OR of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.97) for the highest quintile of intake compared with the lowest quintile of intake (P-trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake of Î±-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25048,27432">linolenic acid</z:chebi> was associated with an increased risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> in men (P-trend = 0.03), which was not seen in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, but not in men, dietary intake of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs was negatively correlated with urinary <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) production (r = -0.18; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher intakes of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs are associated with lower risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in women, and the association may be mediated in part through a reduction in the production of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00625066 </plain></SENT>
