<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 99 patients with stage II or III colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with oral UFT + LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Germline DNA from patients was genotyped for 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism-relating genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CYP2A6, tegafur-activating enzyme, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17659">uridine diphosphate</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 genetic variation were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was graded by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression revealed that OPRT 638G&gt;C polymorphism was associated with grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) 19.84 for patients with the C/C homozygous type compared with patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, P = 0.014] and polymorphisms of UGT1A1 were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (OR 38.76 for homozygotes and double heterozygotes of *6 or *28 compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No relationships were observed between TS polymorphisms and any toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OPRT polymorphism predicts toxicity, especially grade 3 or greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> to oral UFT + LV adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas TS does not, in our study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1 polymorphism seems to be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> due to UFT+LV </plain></SENT>
