<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective: Pharmacogenomic associations between severe oxaliplatininduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> peripheral neurotoxicity (OXCPN) (Grade 2 lasting for &gt; 7 days or Grade 3) and 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 genes (TAC1, FOXC1, ITGA1, ACYP2, DLEU7, BTG4, CAMK2N1, and FARS2) were reported by the genomewide association study (GWAS) in Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to explore reliable predictors of OXCPN and thereby improve the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: We retrospectively investigated pharmacogenomic characteristics of OXCPN in 70 Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy and updated the results of our previous analysis of ERCC1 (C118T, rs11615 and C8092A, rs3212986) and GSTP1 (Ile105Val, rs1695) polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Univariate analysis suggested potential associations of severe OXCPN with rs843748 in ACYP2 and rs17140129 in FARS2, as well as with the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) (p = 0.056, 0.072, and 0.029, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no association between severe OXCPN and any of the 7 other SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that an increased risk of severe OXCPN was related to rs17140129 and the absence of DM (p = 0.034 and 0.030, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On updated analysis, polymorphisms of ERCC1 (C118T, rs11615) and rs10486003 in TAC1 were associated with time to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Grade 1 OXCPN (p = 0.024 and 0.049, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Severe OXCPN is significantly related to rs17140129, found in the GWAS of Korean patients, in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients without DM are more likely to have OXCPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between ERCC1 polymorphism and time to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of OXCPN was significant on updated analysis </plain></SENT>
