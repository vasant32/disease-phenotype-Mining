<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Database, and Wan Fang Digital Journals from inception to October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary clinical outcomes included the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) was estimated by using fixed-effects or random-effects models according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten studies were considered eligible that included 1487 patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with the KRAS p.G13D mutation had a significantly higher ORR (10 studies; RR, 1.642; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.131-2.384), longer PFS (1 study; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36-0.81), and longer OS (1 study; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.80) than patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with KRAS codon 12 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients who had KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, patients with the p.G13D mutation had a significantly lower ORR (9 studies; RR, 0.540; 95% CI, 0.381-0.765) and nonsignificantly shorter PFS (1 study; HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68-1.45) and OS (1 study; HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.66-1.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had mCRC with the KRAS p.G13D mutation appeared to benefit more from cetuximab than patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with KRAS codon 12 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, because of the limited sample sizes in the current meta-analysis, these results should be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
