<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed IFITM1/pEGFP-C3 recombinant plasmids and transfected them into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> SW480 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFITM1/pEGFP-C3 recombinant plasmids were identified by means of immunofluorescence, laser confocal scanning microscopy, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFITM1/SW480 cells with stable over-expression of IFITM1 were confirmed by G418 screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influences of IFITM1 on the proliferation of the SW480 cell lines were investigated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> transplantation experiments in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell invasion experiments were performed to determine the invasion capacity of the IFITM1/SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 activities were detected by the gelatin zymographic analysis, and MMP-9 expression by the Western blotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IFITM1/pEGFP-C3 recombinant plasmids were successfully constructed in this study, and the IFITM1/SW480 cells with stable IFITM1 gene over-expression were confirmed by G418 screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> results showed that the proliferation of the IFITM1/SW480 cells was significantly enhanced (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were harvested from four weeks old mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the numbers of the SW480 cells and IFITM1/SW480 cells that migrated through Matrigel were 448.64 ± 38.09 and 540.45 ± 44.61, respectively; so the invasive ability of the SW480 cells transfected with IFITM1 gene was significantly greater than that of the SW480 cells (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gelatin zymographic analysis showed that MMP-9 and MMP-2 protein activities in the IFITM1/SW480 cells were significantly enhanced, and Western blotting analysis showed that MMP-9 expression in the IFITM1/SW480 cells was also increased </plain></SENT>
