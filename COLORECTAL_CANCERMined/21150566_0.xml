<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study consisted of 190 participants (150 patients and 40 healthy individuals) aged 40 to 70 years who underwent complete colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From each participant, a stool sample was collected 1 day before colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were instructed to collect another sample after the fourteenth postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No special diet was recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fecal markers were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in most participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal tumors</z:e> were accompanied by a highly significant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median value of Hb-Hp complex was 23.22±10.02 (P&lt;0.0001) whereas the median values of MPO and sIgA were 14936.43±9580.83 (P&lt;0.0001) and 6503.38±2794.87 (P&lt;0.0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of Hb-Hp complex, MPO, and sIgA are 95.3% and 87.5%, 96% and 87%, and 90.8% and 85%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference of preoperative and postoperative values of the patients was statistically significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After surgical intervention, the value of Hb-Hp complex was normalized in 133 of the 150 patients (88.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative values of MPO were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in 131 patients (87.3%), whereas those of secretory IgA were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in 103 of the 150 patients (68.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fecal Hb-Hp complex, MPO, and sIgA can effectively be used as screening tools for the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and for the postoperative follow-up of patients </plain></SENT>
