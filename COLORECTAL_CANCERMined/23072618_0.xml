<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdensitometry for quantitative evaluation of osteopontin immunohistochemistry (clone OP3N) on digital microphotographs using the public domain software ImageJ was observed to be straightforward to perform and reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, using colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines (n = 11) the correlation between densitometric evaluations of Western blots and microdensitometry of immunocytochemistry of slide cultures was only moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A virtual resampling method to simulate tissue microarrays showed that, due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of immunostaining, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were misclassified in nearly 20% of the arrays, even if four punches were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to prognosis, microdensitometric evaluation of a tissue microarray made of a clinicopathologically well-characterized series of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> with long-term follow-up (222 cases evaluable in the tissue microarray, UICC Stages I-III/R0) showed a moderate survival advantage of patients with high osteopontin expression by microdensitometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results challenge the basic assumption that microdensitometry is a precise technique for the quantification of proteins detected by immunohistochemistry and delineate drawbacks encountered when working with tissue microarrays in clinicopathological studies </plain></SENT>
