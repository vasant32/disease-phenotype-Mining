<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Evidence-based medicine was first defined by Sackett as 'the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This requires good quality studies with a high level of proof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these studies are often lacking in colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the topics on which there is general agreement will be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is now good evidence that the laparoscopic approach is at least equivalent in oncological terms to the conventional open approach in colonic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The question, however, remains unanswered for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgery, which is technically more demanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there are no randomized studies, the introduction of total mesorectal excision for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> has achieved a major reduction in local recurrence and has been adopted as the gold standard by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extending this concept to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> surgery is currently under discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The different types of reconstruction in sphincter-preserving surgery which achieve a better functional result than straight anastomosis, including colonic pouch, transverse coloplasty and side-to-end anastomosis, will be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The benefit of temporary fecal diversion in low anastomosis has now been demonstrated with a good level of evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The technique of abdominoperineal resection has evolved in the last years and now aims at obtaining a cylindrical specimen, which has resulted in a significant reduction of the local recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, the technique of local resection has been improved by the introduction of transanal endoscopic microsurgery </plain></SENT>
