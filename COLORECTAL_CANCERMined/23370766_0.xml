<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A minority of microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> exhibit discordance between CIMP and MLH1 methylation statuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinicopathological features of such microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with discrepant MLH1 methylation and CIMP statuses remain poorly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (n=220) were analyzed for CIMP and MLH1 methylation statuses using the MethyLight assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the combinatorial CIMP and MLH1 methylation statuses, the microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were grouped into four subtypes (CIMP-high (CIMP-H) MLH1 methylation-positive (MLH1m+), CIMP-H MLH1 methylation-negative, CIMP-low/0 (CIMP-L/0) MLH1m+, and CIMP-L/0 MLH1 methylation-negative), which were compared in terms of their associations with clinicopathological and molecular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CIMP-L/0 MLH1 methylation-negative and CIMP-H MLH1m+ subtypes were predominant, comprising 63.6 and 24.1% of total microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discordant subtypes, CIMP-H MLH1 methylation-negative and CIMP-L/0 MLH1m+, were found in 5 and 7% of microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CIMP-H MLH1 methylation-negative subtype exhibited elevated incidence rates in male patients and was associated with larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, more frequent loss of MSH2 expression, increased frequency of KRAS mutation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CIMP-L/0 MLH1m+ subtype was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at an earlier age, a predominance of MLH1 loss, and earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the CIMP-L/0 MLH1m+ subtype patients succumbed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the discordant subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> exhibit distinct clinicopathological and molecular features, although the proportion of discordant subtypes is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microsatellite-unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> of the same CIMP status tended to exhibit different clinicopathological features depending on MLH1 methylation status.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 1 February 2013; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2012.241 </plain></SENT>
