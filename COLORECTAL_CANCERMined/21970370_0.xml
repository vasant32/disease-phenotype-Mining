<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of family history is a well established risk factor with 25-35% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> attributable to inherited and/or familial factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The highly penetrant inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> syndromes account for approximately 5%, leaving greater than 20% without clear genetic definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been linked to chromosome 7q31 by multiple affected relative pair studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MET proto-oncogene which resides in this chromosomal region is considered a candidate for genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MET exons were amplified by PCR from germline DNA of 148 affected sibling pairs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amplicons with altered sequence were detected with high-resolution melt-curve analysis using a LightScanner (Idaho Technologies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Samples demonstrating alternative melt curves were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A TaqMan assay for the specific c.2975C &gt;T change was used to confirm this mutation in a cohort of 299 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and to look for allelic amplification in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we report a germline non-synonymous change in the MET proto-oncogene at amino acid position T992I (also reported as MET p.T1010I) in 5.2% of a cohort of sibling pairs affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This genetic variant was then confirmed in a second cohort of individuals diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and having a first degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> at prevalence of 4.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This mutation has been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells of multiple origins, including 2.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, and in &lt;1% in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The threonine at amino acid position 992 lies in the tyrosine kinase domain of MET and a change to isoleucine at this position has been shown to promote metastatic behavior in cell-based models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The average age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis in patients in this study is 63 years in mutation carriers, which is 8 years earlier than the general population average for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the MET p.T992I genetic mutation is commonly found in somatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues, this is the first report also implicating this MET genetic mutation as a germline inherited risk factor for familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future studies on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks associated with this mutation and the prevalence in different at-risk populations will be an important extension of this work to define the clinical significance </plain></SENT>
