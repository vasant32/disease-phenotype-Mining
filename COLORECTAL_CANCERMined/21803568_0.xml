<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has increased, mainly in the eastern part of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient delay due to unawareness or ignorance of symptoms and differences in use of diagnostic tools could have influence on the stage distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate geographical differences in stage-specific incidence rates of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Age-adjusted incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the colon</z:e> and rectum diagnosed in 2001-2005 and registered in the Netherlands <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry were calculated for each municipality and stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence for each 500m by 500m grid was estimated as a weighted average of the incidence rates of the neighbouring municipalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates and the stage distribution are both presented as maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Geographic variation in stage-specific incidence was evaluated using spatial scan statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, significant spatial variation in stage-specific incidences was found, except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> of stages III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regions with a higher stage-specific incidence were almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the south eastern part of the Netherlands, however, these differences were not seen in the stage distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in stage distribution between large cities and the rest of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These maps give insight into differences in stage-specific incidences of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Educational interventions to increase the awareness of symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> may be especially useful for the population in regions with high incidence of advanced stages </plain></SENT>
