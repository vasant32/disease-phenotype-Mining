<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated the biological behavior of proximal and distal colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), intending to determine specific segmental differences, possibly arising from the distinct genetic pathways involved in their development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six proximal and 83 distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were comparatively and retrospectively analyzed, regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, grade and Ki-67, p53 and Bcl-2 immunohistochemical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were more likely to be poorly differentiated (p=0.005) and to exhibit low Ki-67 and p53 expression (&lt;20% and â‰¤ 30% stained nuclei respectively; p=0.026 and 0.0014, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distal lesions were more likely to be moderately differentiated (p=0.001), to display moderate Ki-67 expression (20-50% stained nuclei, p= 0.013) and p53 staining higher than 30% stained nuclei (p= 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such segmental variations regarding mainly p53 and to a lesser extent Ki-67 were seen within most of the specific sub-groups of patients (stratified by stage, grade, gender and age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An association between Bcl-2 expression and distal site was also observed among females (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Proximal and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> displayed different clinicopathological and molecular patterns, reinforcing the proposal that they are genetically and biologically different entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Potential clinical applications of these findings should be investigated </plain></SENT>
