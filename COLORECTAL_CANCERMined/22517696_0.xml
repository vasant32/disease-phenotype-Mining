<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The monoclonal antibody cetuximab that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been found effective in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, mutations in exons 12 and 13 of KRAS oncogene have been reported as negative predictive factors for the treatment response using cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the published studies investigating the predictive value of KRAS mutations in the efficacy of cetuximab in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivities, specificities and predictive values (negative and positive) of KRAS mutations as regards treatment response were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were initially found during the literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After thorough evaluation, 13 papers were excluded for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 13 studies were included in the present meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these studies, specificities were found much higher than sensitivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combining the data from the 13 studies, it was found that KRAS mutations comprise a negative predictive biomarker for response to cetuximab with very high specificity (0.96; 95% CI 0.84-0.99), and low sensitivity (0.47; 95% CI 0.43-0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the publication bias was found statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that cetuximab should be administered only to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who have the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (KRASw) oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the KRAS gene are a negative predictive factor for response to cetuximab with very high specificity and low sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The latter may very well be attributed to additional mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies such as mutations in BRAF </plain></SENT>
