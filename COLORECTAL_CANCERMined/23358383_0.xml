<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in treatment and survival are likely to have increased lifetime costs of managing the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cost-of-illness (COI) studies are key building blocks in economic evaluations of interventions and comparative effectiveness research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We systematically reviewed and critiqued the COI literature on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : We searched several databases for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> COI studies published in English, between January 2000 and February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information was abstracted on: setting, patient population, top-down/bottom-up costing, incident/prevalent approach, payer perspective, time horizon, costs included, cost source, and per-person costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We developed a framework to compare study methodologies and assess homogeneity/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : A total of 26 papers met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was extensive methodological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies included case-control studies based on claims/reimbursement data (10), examinations of patient charts (5), and analysis of claims data (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological approaches varied (prevalent, 6; incident, 8; mixed, 10; unclear, 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time horizons ranged from 1 year postdiagnosis to lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen studies used top-down costing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five studies included healthcare-payer direct medical costs; 2 included indirect costs; 1 considered patient costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was broad agreement in how studies accounted for time, but few studies described costs in sufficient detail to allow replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In general, costs were not comparable between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Methodological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and lack of transparency made it almost impossible to compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> costs between studies or over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For COI studies to be more useful and robust there is need for clear and rigorous guidelines around methodological and reporting "best practice." </plain></SENT>
