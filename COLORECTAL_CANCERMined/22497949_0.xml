<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no clinically useful markers that could predict the response to these regimens respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at identifying serum protein patterns which could predict the efficacy of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Serum from 70 patients diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> before first-line chemotherapy were collected and analyzed for protein patterns using ANN analysis of SELDI-TOF-MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 70 cases, 44 patients received FOLFOX chemotherapy, while the other 26 patients received FOLFIRI chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After four cycles of the treatment, RECIST criteria were used to define the responders (R) and non-responders (NR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A potential predicting pattern consisting of 6 biomarkers was identified in the patients receiving FOLFOX chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this predicting pattern, the responders could be separated from the non-responders with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 81.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another potential predicting pattern that consisted of 7 bio-markers was identified in the patients who have received FOLFIRI chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and the specificity of this predicting pattern were 92.3% and 92.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two potential pat-terns for the prediction of efficacy of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy were established in this preliminary study </plain></SENT>
