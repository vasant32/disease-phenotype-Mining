<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 2 rural counties with high rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and randomly contacted county residents by telephone using a published <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred thirty-five of the 1839 eligible respondents (34.5%) between the ages of 50 and 79 years living in McDuffie and Screven counties, Georgia, agreed to complete the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 62.2 years (SD, Â±7.5 years); 72.4% were women, 79.4% were white, and 19.5% were African American </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>African-American respondents had lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates (50.4%) than whites (63.4%; P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly more African Americans compared with whites reported barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on logistic regression analyses, having a physician recommend <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening had the strongest association with having a current <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, regardless of race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Important racial differences existed between African Americans and whites regarding the barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and factors impacting current screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, endorsement of a small set of questionnaire items--not race--had the strongest association with being current with screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physician recommendation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening had the strongest association with being current with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
