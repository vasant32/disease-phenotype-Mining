<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, these results were further developed by combining fluorescence with the biomarkers, CEA and TIMP-1 and traditional metabolomic measurements in the form of (1)H NMR spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that using an extensive profile established by combining such measurements together with the biomarkers is better than using single markers </plain></SENT>
