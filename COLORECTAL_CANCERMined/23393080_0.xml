<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether work related stress, measured and defined as job strain, is associated with the overall risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and the risk of colorectal, lung, breast, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Meta-analysis of pooled prospective individual participant data from 12 European cohort studies including 116,056 men and women aged 17-70 who were free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at study baseline and were followed-up for a median of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Work stress was measured and defined as job strain, which was self reported at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> n=5765, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> n=522, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> n=374, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> n=1010, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> n=865) were ascertained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, hospital admission, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed in each study with Cox regression and the study specific estimates pooled in meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Models were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol intake RESULTS: A harmonised measure of work stress, high job strain, was not associated with overall risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.04) in the multivariable adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no association was observed between job strain and the risk of colorectal (1.16, 0.90 to 1.48), lung (1.17, 0.88 to 1.54), breast (0.97, 0.82 to 1.14), or prostate (0.86, 0.68 to 1.09) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no clear evidence for an association between the categories of job strain and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that work related stress, measured and defined as job strain, at baseline is unlikely to be an important risk factor for colorectal, lung, breast, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
