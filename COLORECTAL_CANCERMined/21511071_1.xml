<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the course of early non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and to identify relevant clinical and psychological predictors during a one-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 144 early non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients initially assessed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> symptoms (SCL-90-R), HRQOL (WHOQOL-BREF), sense of coherence (SOC), defense mechanisms (LSI) and hostility (HDHQ), 84 (58.3%) completed the one-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean (SD) age was 65.1 (9.8) years and 67.4% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean (SD) disease duration was 1.7 (2.2) years, with 49.3% being diagnosed within the last six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 75.0% the site was at colon and in 25.0% at rectum; 2.1% had stage I, 59.0% stage II and 38.9% stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747249" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Paranoid ideation</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687131" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoticism</z:e>, interpersonal sensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and depressive symptoms increased significantly over the one-year period of the study and most of the HRQOL components were significantly decreased over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men were at greater risk for further developing depressive symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low SOC was independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, while hostility independently predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, interpersonal sensitivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687131" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoticism</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>General <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> and low SOC were independent predictors of HRQOL, while repression was also an independent predictor of Physical HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In early non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> symptoms are increased and HRQOL is decreased over one-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> are strong predictors of HRQOL, while personality variables can also predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> symptoms' increase and HRQOL decrease over time, and this could be relevant to psychological interventions </plain></SENT>
