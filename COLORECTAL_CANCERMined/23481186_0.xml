<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, an association between expression of mismatch repair (MMR) genes and favourable postoperative survival in stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> receiving 5-FU chemotherapy has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unknown if the expression of ERCC1 protein and MMR status are associated with survival of stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> receiving OX-based chemotherapy.Methods:Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of the expression of MMR and ERCC1 was performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue of 255 patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 95 patients received fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy and 160 patients received OX-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A predictive model for 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was constructed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, logistic and Cox regression.Results:Patients who were treated with OX-based therapy with positive ERCC1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> had lower 5-year DFS (54%) and OS (60%) than those with negative ERCC1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (72% and 78%, respectively; DFS HR: 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-3.31, P=0.009; OS HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.37-4.34, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 status did not impact DFS or OS in fluorouracil group (DFS HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.63-2.14, P=0.62; OS HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.63-2.14, P=0.63), whereas MMR status had no impact on DFS or OS in either group.Conclusion:Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 status is highly predictive of which patients will benefit from the addition of OX to 5-FU for stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mismatch repair status had no predictive value in this setting </plain></SENT>
