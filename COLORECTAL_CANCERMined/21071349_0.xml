<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein expression was analyzed in 50 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients, using the immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reaction for FasR was weak in 75.5% and strong in 24.5% of the study patients, as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> glandular epithelium where FasR expression was strong in 100% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, FasL expression was found to be weak in 30% and strong in 70% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, as compared to its lack in 100% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed strong expression of FasL was found to correlate statistically significantly with vascular invasion (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlations of FasL and FasR expression in the main mass of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was found between other clinic-pathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fas ligand and Fas receptor appeared to be of little usefulness as prognostic factors for different groups of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these proteins could become good therapeutic targets for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> since their expression differs distinctly between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal epithelium and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, and known is the mechanism by which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells escape <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing Fas/FasL pathway disorders </plain></SENT>
