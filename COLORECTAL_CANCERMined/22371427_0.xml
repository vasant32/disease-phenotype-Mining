<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This Phase 1 dose-escalation study assessed the safety, tolerability, maximum-tolerated dose, antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of neratinib in Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received neratinib 80, 160, 240 or 320 mg orally; each patient enrolled in only one dose cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received a single dose in week 1, followed by daily continuous doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples collected were on days 1 and 21 for pharmacokinetic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled (3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>; 17 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neratinib-related adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (20 patients), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (14 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (9 patients each) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade ≥3 neratinib-related adverse events in two or more patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> (two patients each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> (two patients, 320 mg dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended dose was neratinib 240 mg once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 21 evaluable patients, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> had partial response, 3 had stable disease ≥24 weeks, 7 had stable disease ≥16 weeks and 9 had progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that neratinib exposures increased with dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of neratinib are consistent with those reported for non-Japanese patients and warrant further investigation of neratinib in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
