<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected detailed information on chemotherapy and supportive drugs in 103 patients within a prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted to determine quality of care within an interdisciplinary context (first endpoint) and direct costs of palliative treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 2006 and 2010 (second endpoint, Emmert et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we evaluate adherence to Multinational Association of Supportive Care in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (MASCC) 2006 recommendations for prophylaxis of CINV during the first administration of chemotherapy as well as incidence and grade of CINV within 120 h thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients studied, 95 patients (92 %) received moderately emetogenic (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- and/or irinotecan-containing combined chemotherapy treatment) and eight (8 %) received low emetogenic chemotherapy (either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> monotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">Antiemetic</z:chebi> prophylaxis could be assessed in 101 out of 103 (98 %) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MASCC-recommended <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> prophylaxis was prescribed in three patients (3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonadherence was mainly caused by omission of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> occurred in 18 patients (18 %) within a 120-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> documented episodes were grade 1 or 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of these patients received the recommended prophylaxis for CINV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In only one patient, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> prophylaxis was intensified during the next chemotherapy application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the Integrated Health Care in the Palliative Treatment of Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp> (IVOPAK) I Project, adherence to the MASCC clinical recommendations was very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Extent of CINV in this patient population seems to be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need to improve clinicians' awareness of this patient-relevant side effect </plain></SENT>
