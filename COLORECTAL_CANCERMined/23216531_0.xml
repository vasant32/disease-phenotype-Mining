<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diet contributes significantly to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) aetiology and may be potentially modifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To review diet-gene interactions, aiming to further the understanding of the underlying biological pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PubMed and Medline were systematically searched for prospective studies in relation to diet, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a meta-analysis, no interaction between NAT1 phenotypes and meat intake in relation to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was found (P-value for interaction 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a trend towards interaction between NAT2 phenotypes and meat intake in relation to risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High meat intake was not associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among carriers of the slow NAT2 phenotype, whereas NAT2 fast acetylators with high meat intake were at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92-2.01) compared with slow acetylators with low meat intake (reference), P-value for interaction = 0.07 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low meat intake in the studied populations may influence the result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interactions between meat, cruciferous vegetables, fibres, calcium, vitamins, and alcohol and ABCB1, NFKB1, GSTM1, GSTT1, CCND1, VDR, MGTM, IL10 and PPARG are suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A number of interactions between genetic variation and diet are suggested, but the findings need replication in independent, prospective, and well-characterised cohorts before conclusions regarding the underlying biological mechanisms can be reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the above criteria are met, studies on diet-gene interactions may contribute valuable insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the role of various dietary items in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
