<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) from <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsies (FNAB) is often diagnostically challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arginase-1 was recently described as a marker of hepatic differentiation in surgical resection specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the expression of arginase-1, HepPar-1, and glypican-3 in FNAB of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> involving the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-eight FNABs including 37 primary or metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCCs</z:mp> (30 well or moderately differentiated and 7 poorly differentiated) and 61 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> involving the liver were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of arginase-1, HepPar-1, and glypican-3 using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cell block material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arginase-1 was more sensitive (81%) than HepPar-1 (70%) or glypican-3 (54%) for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arginase-1 more often demonstrated diffuse staining, defined as reactivity in &gt;50% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> (21 of 37; 57%) compared with HepPar-1 (15 of 37; 41%) and glypican-3 (12 of 37; 32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCCs</z:mp>, 3 (43%) were immunoreactive for both arginase-1 and glypican-3, whereas only 1 (14%) demonstrated HepPar-1 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arginase-1 expression was identified in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of pancreatic, colorectal, and breast origin, and reactivity was diffuse in 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006725'>pancreatic adenocarcinomas</z:hpo> (2 of 15; 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Arginase-1 is a more sensitive marker of hepatic differentiation than either HepPar-1 or glypican-3 in FNAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, arginase-1 exhibits more diffuse staining in <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> than either HepPar-1 or glypican-3, making interpretation easier in limited FNAB samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Arginase-1 is not entirely specific for hepatic differentiation, as immunoreactivity can be identified in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, particularly of pancreatic origin </plain></SENT>
