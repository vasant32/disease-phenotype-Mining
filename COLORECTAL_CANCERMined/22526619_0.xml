<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oroxylin A is a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> found in the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, a herbal medicine commonly used as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35493">antipyretic</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi>, antitumor, and anti-in&amp;fllig;ammatory agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has recently been investigated for its anticancer activities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e>, gastric, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the antitumor effects of oroxylin A in human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HCT-116 cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We characterized the proapoptotic effect of oroxylin A using diamidino-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>) and annexin V/PI staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then found that both caspase-3 and caspase-9 were activated, the expression of Bcl-2 protein decreased, and the expression of Bax protein increased after treatment with oroxylin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, oroxylin A increased nuclear transcription factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and induced Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that oroxylin A treatment elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and increased the protein expression level of two of the Nrf2 target genes <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="25523">NADP</z:chebi>(H):<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase-1 in HCT-116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, our study demonstrated that oral administration of oroxylin A significantly decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume and weight in immunodeficient mice that were inoculated with HCT-116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The in-vivo chemopreventive efficacy of oroxylin A against HCT-116 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was accompanied by its proapoptotic and Nrf2-inducing activities, which correlates with the in-vitro study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of oroxylin A-dependent chemoprevention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and may offer a potential mechanism for its anticancer action in vivo </plain></SENT>
