<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) in China has increased in the past 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is anticipated that the incidence of UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) will also increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in UC patients is still unknown in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the risk and risk factors of UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 3,922 patients with UC were retrospectively collected from five central teaching hospitals in China, in which high-quality endoscopic and histological diagnoses were available from 1998 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The database of the UC and UC-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed 34 in patients, and the overall prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with UC was 0.87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after a disease duration of 10 years was 1.15% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-1.84%); 20 years, 3.56% (95% CI 2.14-5.89%); and 30 years, 14.36% (95% CI 7.57-26.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longer disease duration, extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> found in the biopsy specimen were identified as risk factors for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> use was identified as a protective factor of UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The period prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was lower than that reported from the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the cumulative risk was found to be comparable to that of Western countries, which suggests that the period prevalence of UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in China may be growing in the future </plain></SENT>
