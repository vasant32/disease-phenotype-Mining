<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Charlson and Elixhauser methods are 2 well-known methods that take comorbidities into account when explaining survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They differ in both the number and categorization of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>, comorbidity, and survival data were acquired from inpatient administrative hospital records in 574 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Robust Poisson regression was used to analyze 2- and 3-year survival according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> features and comorbidities classified by the Charlson and Elixhauser methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data for weight-related conditions (body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>) and performance status were acquired upon a new patient visit to the regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discrimination was assessed with the concordance (c) statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A base model (age, sex, stage) had excellent discrimination (c-statistic, 0.824 [2-year survival] and 0.827 [3-year survival]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of Charlson comorbidities did not outperform the base model (c-statistic, 0.831 [2-year survival] and 0.833 [3-year survival]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elixhauser comorbidities added higher discrimination compared with the base model, both in stage and overall (c-statistic, 0.852 [2-year survival] and 0.854 [3-year survival]; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The greatest increase in the c-statistic contributed by the addition of the Elixhauser comorbidities occurred in stage II patients (increased from 0.683 to 0.838) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the Elixhauser comorbidities outperformed the Charlson comorbidities (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of self-reported weight and performance status data significantly increased discrimination by the Elixhauser method in 2-year but not 3-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Elixhauser method is a superior comorbidity risk-adjustment model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survival prediction </plain></SENT>
