<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MUTYH removes <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> misincorporated opposite the DNA oxidation product, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi> (OG), thereby preventing accumulation of G:C to T:A transversion mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated MUTYH variant proteins when expressed in bacteria exhibit reduced OG:A mismatch affinity and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> removal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, direct evaluation of OG:A mismatch repair efficiency in mammalian cells has not been assessed due to the lack of an appropriate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this, we developed a novel fluorescence-based assay of OG:A repair and measured the repair capacity of MUTYH-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> variants expressed in Mutyh-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The repair of a single site-specific synthetic lesion in a green fluorescent protein reporter leads to green fluorescent protein expression with co-expression of a red fluorescent protein serving as the transfection control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell lines that stably express the MUTYH-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> variants G382D and Y165C have significantly lower OG:A repair versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> MEFs and MEFs expressing human <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> MUTYH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MUTYH allele that encodes the Q324H variant is found at a frequency above 40% in samples from different ethnic groups and has long been considered phenotypically silent but has recently been associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in several clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis of Q324H MUTYH expressed in insect cells showed that it has reduced enzyme activity similar to that of the known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> variant G382D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we find that OG:A repair in MEFs expressing Q324H was significantly lower than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls, establishing that Q324H is functionally impaired and providing further evidence that this common variant may lead to increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
