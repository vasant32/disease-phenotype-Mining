<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients underwent robotic-assisted transabdominal ISR with coloanal anastomosis for low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures included 5 steps: colonic mobilization with ligation of inferior mesenteric vessels, total mesorectal excision, intersphincteric dissection with rectal transection, specimen retrieval, and coloanal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median operation time was 210 minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 40.0 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hypogastric nerve and pelvic nerve plexus was preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No intraoperative-related or robotic system-related morbidities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, R0 resection was achieved, and the quality of the total mesorectal excision was optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Robotic transabdominal ISR is a safe operation with an expectation of future advances in pathologic quality and functional preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional work in a larger series of patients is necessary to refine this technique and to establish its efficacy </plain></SENT>
