<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are able to infiltrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and thereby effectively deliver gene therapeutic payloads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we engineered murine MSCs (mMSCs) to express a secreted form of the TNF-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is a potent inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and tested these MSCs, termed MSC.sTRAIL, in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drug treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When we pretreated human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> HCT116 cells with low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and added MSC.sTRAIL, we found significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> as compared with single-agent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HCT116 xenografts, which were cotreated with 5-FU and systemically delivered MSC.sTRAIL, went into remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, this effect was protein 53 (p53) independent and was mediated by TRAIL-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) upregulation, demonstrating the applicability of this approach in p53-defective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, when we generated MSCs that secreted TRAIL-R2-specific variants of soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL), we found that such engineered MSCs, labeled MSC.sTRAIL(DR5), had enhanced antitumor activity in combination with 5-FU when compared with MSC.sTRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TRAIL-resistant pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> PancTu1 cells responded better to MSC.sTRAIL(DR4) when the antiapoptotic protein XIAP (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein) was silenced concomitantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results demonstrate that TRAIL-receptor selective variants can potentially enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-delivered TRAIL as part of individualized and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific combination treatments </plain></SENT>
