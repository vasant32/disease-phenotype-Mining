<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The gold-standard tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detection is colonoscopy, but it provides only mucosal surface visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound biomicroscopy allows a clear delineation of the epithelium and adjacent colonic layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to design a system to generate endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopic images of the mouse colon, inÂ vivo, in an animal model of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen mice (Mus musculus) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 40-MHz miniprobe catheter was inserted into the accessory channel of a pediatric flexible bronchofiberscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control mice (n = 3) and mice treated with azoxymethane and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (n = 10) were subjected to simultaneous endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopy and white-light colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis obtained with endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopy and colonoscopy was compared and confirmed by postmortem histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopic images showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and revealed lesions such as <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasias</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopy was able to detect two cases of mucosa layer thickening, confirmed by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to histologic results, the sensitivities of endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopy and colonoscopy were 0.95 and 0.83, respectively, and both methods achieved specificities of 1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopy can be used, in addition to colonoscopy, as a diagnostic method for colonic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, experimental endoluminal ultrasound biomicroscopy in mouse models is feasible and might be used to further develop research on the differentiation between benign and malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
