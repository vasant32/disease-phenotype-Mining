<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mesorectal excision is the international standard surgical procedure for lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, lateral pelvic lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> occasionally occurs in patients with clinical stage II or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III rectal cancer</z:e>, and therefore mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We did a randomised controlled trial to confirm that the results of mesorectal excision alone are not inferior to those of mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was undertaken at 33 major hospitals in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligibility criteria included histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> of clinical stage II or stage III, with the main lesion located in the rectum with the lower margin below the peritoneal reflection, and no lateral pelvic lymph node enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After surgeons had confirmed macroscopic R0 resection by mesorectal excision, patients were intraoperatively randomised to mesorectal excision alone or with lateral lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The groups were balanced by a minimisation method according to clinical N staging (N0 or N1, 2), sex, and institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allocated procedure was not masked to investigators or patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is now in the follow-up stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is relapse-free survival and will be reported after the primary analysis planned for 2015 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we compare operation time, blood loss, postoperative morbidity (grade 3 or 4), and hospital mortality between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention-to-treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00190541 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 351 patients were randomly assigned to mesoretcal excision with lateral lymph node dissection and 350 to mesorectal excision alone, between June 11, 2003, and Aug 6, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient in the mesorectal excision alone group underwent lateral lymph node dissection, but was analysed in their assigned group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Operation time was significantly longer in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group (median 360 min, IQR 296-429) than in the mesorectal excision alone group (254 min, 210-307, p&lt;0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Blood loss was significantly higher in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group (576 mL, IQR 352-900) than in the mesorectal excision alone group (337 mL, 170-566; p&lt;0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>26 (7%) patients in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group had lateral pelvic lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 postoperative complications occurred in 76 (22%) patients in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group and 56 (16%) patients in the mesorectal excision alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 or 4 postoperative complication was anastomotic leakage (18 [6%] patients in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group vs 13 [5%] in the mesorectal excision alone group; p=0·46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>One patient in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group died of anastomotic leakage followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection required a significantly longer operation time and resulted in significantly greater blood loss than mesorectal excision alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis will help to show whether or not mesorectal excision alone is non-inferior to mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>FUNDING: National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan </plain></SENT>
