<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with stages I-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> who underwent colectomy between January and December 2011 from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Clinic, were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the intervention group participated in the postoperative inpatient exercise program consisted of twice daily exercise, including stretching, core, balance, and low-intensity resistance exercises </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The usual care group was not prescribed a structured exercise program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were time to flatus, time to first liquid diet, anthropometric measurements, and physical function measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 31 (86.1 %) patients completed the trial, with adherence to exercise interventions at 84.5 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean length of hospital stay was 7.82 ± 1.07 days in the exercise group compared with 9.86 ± 2.66 days in usual care (mean difference, 2.03 days; 95 % confidence interval (CI), -3.47 to -0.60 days; p = 0.005) in per-protocol analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean time to flatus was 52.18 ± 21.55 h in the exercise group compared with 71.86 ± 29.2 h in the usual care group (mean difference, 19.69 h; 95 % CI, -38.33 to -1.04 h; p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-to-moderate-intensity postsurgical exercise reduces length of hospital stay and improves bowel motility after colectomy procedure in patients with stages I-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
