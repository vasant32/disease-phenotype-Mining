<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutation detection in PMS2 has been difficult due to the presence of several pseudogenes, but a custom-designed long-range PCR strategy now allows adequate mutation detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many mutations are unique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, some mutations are observed repeatedly across individuals not known to be related due to the mutation being either recurrent, arising multiple times de novo at hot spots for mutations, or of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> origin, having occurred once in an ancestor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previously, we observed 36 distinct mutations in a sample of 61 independently ascertained Caucasian probands of mixed European background with PMS2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these mutations were detected in more than one individual not known to be related and of these, six were detected more than twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These six mutations accounted for 31 (51%) ostensibly unrelated probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we performed genotyping and haplotype analysis in four mutations observed in multiple probands and found two (c.137G&gt;T and exon 10 deletion) to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations and one (c.903G&gt;T) a probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One (c.1A&gt;G) could not be evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We discuss possible explanations for the frequent occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations in PMS2 </plain></SENT>
