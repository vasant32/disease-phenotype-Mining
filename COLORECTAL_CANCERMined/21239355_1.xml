<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQCR29 when applied to a sample of Spanish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients in the treatment follow-up period after receiving surgery and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy subjects also had adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients completed both the EORTC QLQC30 and the QLQ-CR29 once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire's structure, reliability, and convergent, divergent and known-groups validity was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multitrait scaling analysis showed that three of the multi-item scales met the standards of convergent and discriminant validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These same scales reached the 0.7 Cronbach's coefficient criterion or were close to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both analyses exceptions were observed in the blood and mucus in stool scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the scales of the QLQC30 and the module were low (r&lt;0.02) in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A few areas with more related content had higher correlations (r&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Group comparison analyses showed differences in QL between groups of patients based on age, comorbidity, performance status, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The EORTC QLQ-CR29 is a reliable and valid instrument when applied to a sample of Spanish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results are in line with those of the EORTC validation study </plain></SENT>
