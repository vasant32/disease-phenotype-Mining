<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of colorectal WF to search for potential biomarkers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome of this approach might open the possibility of using WF to screen for the precancerous and early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples of WFs were obtained during surgery from 35 patients submitted to colon resection for suspicious <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, while the respective controls were obtained by washing the healthy sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WFs were immediately centrifuged, concentrated and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30956">trichloroacetic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) was added to obtain protein pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE), the protein patterns of malignant samples were compared with respective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one protein spots were found to be differentially expressed exhibiting â‰¥2 fold-change of mean value spot intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After mass spectrometry, these protein spots collapsed into 38 different proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 19 of the differentially expressed proteins identified in the study corresponded to those suggested as being potential biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the literature, these proteins showed the same direction of change (up or down for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proteins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that WF has the potential of being a method for the exploration of clinical samples for biomarker and drug target discovery </plain></SENT>
