<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cecostomy is the creation of an opening in the cecum to provide colonic decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This work was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tube cecostomy as an alternative to colostomy in the managing patients with left-sided colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in terms of occurrence of postoperative morbidity and mortality and the functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A total number of 156 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled in the study and were divided randomly into two equal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A group of 78 patients underwent tube cecostomy (group A) were compared with the other 78 patients who underwent loop colostomy (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome parameters were the incidence of anastomotic leak, operative time, primary operation mortality rate, patient satisfaction and hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean operating time and the mean hospital slay was significantly shorter in tube cecostomy group when compared with loop colostomy group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall recorded morbidity for the primary operation was 12.8% and 29.5% for group A and B respectively [P ≥ 0.05] while the stoma related complications rate was 7.7% and 25.6% for each group respectively [P ≤ 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Performing tube cecostomy instead loop colostomy in managing patients with left-sided colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> can decrease the anticipated postoperative morbidity, lowers prolonged hospital stay and provides adequate functional outcome </plain></SENT>
