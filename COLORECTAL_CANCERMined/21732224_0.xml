<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of the MMR gene MSH2 may be a quantitative marker for the level of MMR and a potential molecular marker with clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the gene expression of MSH2 in primary operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in correlation with MSI, protein expression, and promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 210 patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphnode metastases</z:e> were analyzed with immunohistochemistry, methylation and MSI analyses, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median gene expression of MSH2 was 1.00 (range 0.16-11.2, quartiles 0.70-1.51) and there was good agreement between the gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (Spearman's rho = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001, n = 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The validity of gene expression analysis was made probable by a significant correlation to protein expression (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSI was most often caused by deficient MLH1 and was not correlated to MSH2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of the MSH2 gene promoter was only detected in 14 samples and only at a low level with no correlation to gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MSH2 gene expression was not a prognostic factor for overall survival in univariate or multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of MSH2 is a potential quantitative marker ready for further clinical validation </plain></SENT>
