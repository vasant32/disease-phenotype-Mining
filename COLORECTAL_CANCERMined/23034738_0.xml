<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated CIMP and MSI status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stages II and III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant FOLFOX were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight CpG island loci (CACNA1G, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CDKN2A (p16), RUNX3 and SOCS1) and five microsatellite markers were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed according to CIMP and MSI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 322 patients were included: male/female 192/130, median age 61 years (range 30-78), proximal/distal location 118/204 and Stages II/III 43/279 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CIMP status was high in 25 patients (7.8%) and 21 patients (6.5%) had MSI-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CIMP/MSI status was not significantly associated with DFS: 3-year DFS 100% in CIMP(-)/MSI(+), 84% in CIMP(-)/MSI(-), 82% in CIMP(+)/MSI(-) and 75% in CIMP(+)/MSI(+) (p = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of exploratory analysis showed that concurrent methylation at NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) was associated with shorter DFS: 3-year DFS 69% in NEUROG1(+)/CDKN2A (p16)(+) versus 87% in NEUROG1(-)/CDKN2A (p16)(-) (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, concurrent methylation of NEUROG1 and CDKN2A (p16) is associated with recurrence following adjuvant FOLFOX in Stages II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
