<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 78 elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomly assigned to receive either the fast-track care programme (n = 40) or the conventional perioperative care protocol (control group, n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical personnel conducting the study were blinded to patients' clinical outcomes prior to statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fast-track protocol included no preoperative mechanical bowel irrigation, immediate oral alimentation and earlier postoperative ambulation exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The length of postoperative hospital stay, the length of time to regain bowel function and the rate of postoperative complications were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The length of time to regain bowel function, including the passage of flatus[31 (26-40) h vs 38 (32-51) h, P = 0.001], to the first bowel movement [55 (48-63) h vs 64 (48-71) h, P = 0.009] and to start a liquid diet (12 [11-16] h vs 47 [35-50] h, P = 0.000) were significantly shorter in patients receiving the fast-track care protocol compared with those receiving the conventional care protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A shorter duration of postoperative hospital stay was recorded in patients receiving the fast-track program than in those receiving conventional care (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reduced percentage of patients who developed general complications was also observed in the fast-track group (5.0%vs 21.1%, P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial has shown that in the elderly undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery, the fast-track recovery programme resulted in a more rapid postoperative recovery, earlier discharge from hospital and fewer general complications compared with a conventional postoperative protocol </plain></SENT>
