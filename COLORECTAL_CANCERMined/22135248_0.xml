<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, full quantification of CEST effects in vivo using standard imaging sequences is time consuming as a large number of saturation frequency offsets, each followed by an imaging readout, are required to define a z spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, outside the brain, the presence of fat can confound the interpretation of z spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel acquisition and post-processing technique is presented in this study, named exchange-modulated point-resolved spectroscopy (EXPRESS), which aims to address these limitations and to enable spatially localised, high signal-to-noise measurements of CEST effects in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> proton exchange (APT) measurements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, it is demonstrated that the acquisition of two-dimensional EXPRESS spectra composed of chemical shift and saturation frequency offset dimensions allows the correction of CEST data containing both fat and water signals, which is a common confounding property of tissues found outside the brain </plain></SENT>
