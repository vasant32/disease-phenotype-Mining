<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients receiving surgical treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred three patients underwent resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total number of lymph nodes recovered and the number of lymph nodes involved were similar in both the laparoscopic group and the open group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had right-sided colon resection had a higher total number of lymph nodes recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no effect of age, sex, race, or body mass index (BMI) on the total number of lymph nodes harvested or on the number of positive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adequate regional lymphadenectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> can be successfully performed using a laparoscopic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics did not make a difference in the number of total or positive lymph nodes recovered </plain></SENT>
