<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence to suggest that the association between socioeconomic circumstances and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence has changed over recent decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a descriptive population-based study to describe the relationship between socioeconomic circumstances and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a pre-screened population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from the West of Scotland were identified from the Scottish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and European age-standardised incidence rates (EASR) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic circumstances were measured using the area-based Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 14,051 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were recorded from 1999 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was associated with increased deprivation in men but not among women; an association that became evident from 2005 onwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 2005 to 2007, the deprivation gap in incidence among men was 13.3 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 3.2-23.4), with rates 19.5% lower among the least deprived compared with the most deprived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This deprivation gap now accounts for an estimated 75 excess cases per year of male <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the West of Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deprivation was associated with higher incidence rates of male, but not female, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> before the implementation of a national bowel screening programme </plain></SENT>
