<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed in a recent <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">Endocrine</z:chebi>-Related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> publication analyzing a limited number of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze GJC1 in a larger clinical cohort (n=485) and to assess whether or not the promoter hypermethylation was associated with clinical or pathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methylation of GJC1 was confirmed to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific and was observed in 33% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and 12% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The methylation was strongly associated with BRAF mutations (P=5.64×10(-13)) as well as with proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (P=1.42×10(-3)), features compatible with a CpG island methylator phenotype </plain></SENT>
