<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to estimate the efficacy and safety of adding cetuximab or panitumumab to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in the first line treatment in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) through meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane library, American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> (ASCO) and European Society for Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> (ESMO) were searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy with or without anti-EGFR drugs (cetuximab or panitumumab) in untreated KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HR) and risk ratio (RR) were used for the meta-analysis and were expressed with 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This meta-analysis included four RCTs with 1270 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients were administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy regimens with or without anti-EGFR MAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of OS was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with chemotherapy alone, the addition of cetuximab or panitumumab didn't result in significant improvement in OS (HR = 1.00, 95%CI [0.88, 1.13], P = 0.95) or PFS (HR = 0.86, 95%CI [0.71, 1.04], P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subgroup analysis of cetuximab also revealed no significant benefit in OS (HR = 1.02, 95%CI [0.89, 1.18], P = 0.75) or in PFS (HR = 0.87, 95%CI [0.65, 1.17], P = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who received combined therapy didn't have a higher ORR (Risk Ratio = 1.08, 95%CI [0.86, 1.36]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Toxicities slightly increased in anti-EGFR drugs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of cetuximab or panitumumab to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of mCRC in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> KRAS population did not improve efficacy in survival benefit and response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More RCTs are warranted to evaluate the combination of chemotherapy and targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
