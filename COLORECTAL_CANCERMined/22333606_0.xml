<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 405 cases were randomly collected from 1798 CRC patients registered at our hospital from January 2000 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective chart review was undertaken for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides the demographics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> features, TNM stage was obtained from medical records and pathological forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other collected data were as follows: (1) Type of clinical examinations leading to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Diagnostic duration: including patient duration (period from initial symptoms to consulting a doctor and hospitalization duration (period from patient first seeing a doctor to a confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) Diagnostic delay and its rate: diagnostic delay was identified as the diagnostic duration of over 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared the different delay periods of 31 - 60, 61 - 90, 91 - 150 and &gt; 150 days and its corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) Misdiagnosis and its rate: that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects were diagnosed and treated as other diseases for at least 30 days was identified as misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The t and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed for the quantitative data and χ(2) test for the qualitative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the study subjects, 67.2% (270/402) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were examined by colonoscopy, 17.4 % (70/402) cases by CT scan or B ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median diagnostic duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 90 days (25% percentile: 40 days, 75% percentile: 210 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median patient duration was 30 days and median hospital duration 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall misdiagnostic rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 27.9% (112/401), higher (39.7%, 48/121) in right sited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than in left sited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (22.9%, 63/275) (χ(2) = 11.7, P = 0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>77.7% (313/403) cases had &gt; 30 days diagnostic delay, 50.8% (156/307) delay attributable to the patients, while 29.0% (89/307) attributable to hospitals and 20.2% (62/307) attributable to both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic duration of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> appeared to be in the same length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no difference of TNM stage at the initial diagnosis was found in groups with different diagnostic durations of 31 - 60, 61 - 90, 91 - 150 and &gt; 150 days (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy is the most effective in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The median diagnostic time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon of its diagnostic delay often occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, the delay is not a major cause for its advanced stage and a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Its inherent biological characteristics may be more important </plain></SENT>
