<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed-tomographic-colonography is generally more accepted than colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare adherence to computed-tomographic-colonography and second-invitation colonoscopy in subjects with positive faecal test refusing colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 198 subjects with positive faecal test who refused first referral to colonoscopy in one endoscopy service of the Florence screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomly invited to computed-tomographic-colonography (n=100) or re-invited to colonoscopy (n=98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mail invitation was followed by a questionnaire administered by phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed-tomographic-colonography findings were verified with colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 32 subjects could not be reached, 71 (35.9%) had undergone colonoscopy on their own; 4 were excluded for contraindications; 30/48 (62.5%) in the computed-tomographic-colonography arm and 11/43 (25.6%) in the colonoscopy arm accepted the proposed examinations (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 1 cancer were found in the 28 subjects who ultimately underwent computed-tomographic-colonography and 2 advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and 2 cancers in the 9 subjects who ultimately underwent second-invitation colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subjects with positive faecal occult blood test refusing colonoscopy show a higher adherence to computed-tomographic-colonography than to second invitation colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
