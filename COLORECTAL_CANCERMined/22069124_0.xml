<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We confirm that NF-κB inhibition potentiated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 anti-tumoural effect after the first course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> grew again at the end of the second course of treatment, generating resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed an increase in the basal NF-κB activation in resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and in two resistant sublines, either obtained from resistant HT-29 tumours (HT-29R cells) or generated in vitro (RSN cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease of NF-κB activation in HT-29R and RSN cells by stable transfections with the super-repressor form of IκBα augmented their sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing gene expression profiles of HT-29 and HT-29R cells, we identified the S100A10/Annexin A2 complex and calpain 2 as over-expressed potential NF-κB inducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SiRNA silencing of calpain 2 but not of S100A10 and/or annexin A2, resulted in a decrease in NF-κB activation, an increase in cellular levels of IκBα and a partial restoration of the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 sensitivity in both HT-29R and RSN cells, suggesting that calpain 2-dependent IκBα degradation mediates <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 secondary resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, targeted therapies directed against calpain 2 may represent a novel strategy to enhance the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> efficacy of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 </plain></SENT>
