<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The outcome of cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) depends on the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of laparoscopy in the preoperative assessment of extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> in potential candidates for cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC was evaluated in a consecutive series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0496779" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">appendiceal cancer</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_303'>pseudomyxoma peritonei</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100003'>peritoneal mesothelioma</z:hpo> referred to a single, national HIPEC centre were included prospectively between June 2006 and January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From September 2010, preoperative evaluation also included a laparoscopy in patients deemed amenable to cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC after radiological evaluation, apart from those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_303'>pseudomyxoma peritonei</z:mpath> with massive amounts of mucin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the period before laparoscopic evaluation, 70 patients underwent laparotomy of whom 39 (56 per cent) completed cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the introduction of laparoscopic assessment, diagnostic laparoscopy was planned in 45 patients and successful in 43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The laparoscopic evaluation excluded 18 patients from surgery because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e>, among other reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopy was uneventful and associated with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were considered amenable to cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC based on laparoscopic findings, of whom 17 completed this treatment; the disease was unresectable in the remaining ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 13 patients who were not eligible for laparoscopic evaluation and were subjected to cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC, 11 completed the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall completion rate of cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC increased to 70 per cent (28 of 40) after the introduction of laparoscopic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diagnostic laparoscopy was valuable in preoperative evaluation of the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e>, and improved patient selection for cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC </plain></SENT>
