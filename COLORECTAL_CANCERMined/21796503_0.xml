<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes (CDH13, DLEC1, FBLN3, hMHL1 and RUNX3) was determined using manual microdissection followed by methylation-specific PCR in 85 paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that methylation frequencies in cancerous tissues were 31.8% for CDH13, 37.6% for DLEC1, 38.8% for FBLN3, 22.4% for hMHL1 and 27.1% for RUNX3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were significantly higher than in corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CDH13 methylation was associated with poor differentiation (P = 0.019) and tended to be predominant in advanced stages (P = 0.084); FBLN3 methylation was associated with advanced stages (P = 0.027) and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the methylation status of CDH13 (P = 0.022), FBLN3 (P = 0.008), CDH13 and/or FBLN3 (P = 0.001) predicted adverse overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, while hMHL1 methylation showed a protective role in survival (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models further indicated that CDH13 and/or FBLN3 methylation, but not that of hMHL1, was an independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found CDH13 and FBLN3 gene methylation are potential biomarkers for poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
