<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this work, we integrated prior knowledge from gene signatures and protein interactions with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and gene/protein network modeling together to identify gene network signatures from gene expression microarray data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated how to apply this approach into discovering gene network signatures for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) from microarray datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we used GSEA to analyze the microarray data through enriching differential genes in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related gene sets from two publicly available up-to-date gene set databases - Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and Gene Signatures Database (GeneSigDB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, we compared the enriched gene sets through enrichment score, false-discovery rate, and nominal p-value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Third, we constructed an integrated protein-protein interaction (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) network through connecting these enriched genes by high-quality interactions from a human annotated and predicted protein interaction database, with a confidence score labeled for each interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we mapped differential gene expressions onto the constructed network to build a comprehensive network model containing visualized transcriptome and proteome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that although MSigDB has more <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-relevant gene sets than GeneSigDB, the integrated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> network connecting the enriched genes from both MSigDB and GeneSigDB can provide a more complete view for discovering gene network signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found several important sub-network signatures for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, such as TP53 sub-network, PCNA sub-network, and IL8 sub-network, corresponding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, DNA repair, and immune response, respectively </plain></SENT>
