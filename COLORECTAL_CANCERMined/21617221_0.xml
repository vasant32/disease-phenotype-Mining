<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possibility that this technique could be applied to the monitoring for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, p16(INK4a) methylation in the serum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients during their follow-up period was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Q-MSP on serum samples from 21 CRC patients undergoing surgery for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the p16INK4a methylation score (p16(INK4a) MS) was evaluated one day before surgery and during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the serum samples collected before primary resection, p16(INK4a) methylation was detected in 8 out of the 13 patients with same methylation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The p16(INK4a) MS decreased within 2 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two patients, who had the potential for recurrence, exhibited p16(INK4a) methylation in their serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One month after surgery, in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrence of tumor</z:e>, a dramatic increase in p16(INK4a) MS was observed, while in the disease-free patients no methylation was seen continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: p16(INK4a) MS could sensitively reflect the recurrence status and may be useful for identifying the presence of recurrence during the follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
