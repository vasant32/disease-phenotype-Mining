<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This research is motivated by a pilot colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> study, where the outcome of interest is the presence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> representing risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and the predictors of interest are protein biomarkers that are repeatedly measured with errors along the length of a microscopic structure in the human colon, the colon crypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers of this type are referred to as functional biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The investigators are interested in identifying features of functional biomarkers that are associated with risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we investigate a joint modeling approach, where the binary clinical outcome is modeled using a logistic regression model with the unobserved true functional biomarkers as the predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most existing methods are developed either for linear models or for functional biomarkers measured without errors and cannot be directly applied to our data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The applicable methods include a two-step method and a maximum likelihood method, which have some limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose a robust semiparametric method to overcome the limitations of the existing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We study the properties of the proposed method, and show in simulations that it compares favorably with other methods and also offers significant savings in CPU time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We analyze the pilot colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> data and show that expression levels of AFC, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, in the transitional area from the proliferation zone to the differentiation zone of colon crypts are likely to be associated with risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the relatively small sample size in the pilot study, our results need to be validated in the future full-scale studies </plain></SENT>
