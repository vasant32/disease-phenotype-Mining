<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were developed for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the applicability of direct sequencing and two real-time PCR methods in the diagnosis of KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used real-time PCR and direct sequencing-based methods to determine applicability of these KRAS mutation tests in 64 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two DNA samples found to be mutation positive by real-time PCR were analyzed again after diluting 100-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we applied the same strategy for the direct sequencing, even a 10-fold dilution did not show the mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we found that sequencing may not be informative when there are only a few mutant cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation screening on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded DNA is very efficient with real-time PCR methods in comparison to direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development and adoption of guidelines for KRAS mutation testing are crucial for success </plain></SENT>
