<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> is not widely performed because of the high risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforations</z:mpath> are divided into macroperforations and microperforations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is a limited amount of clinical data on the outcome of patients with these types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> during colonic ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of patients who sustained colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> during ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared the clinical outcome of patients with microperforations and those with macroperforations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study enrolled 101 patients with colorectal laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (LST) who underwent ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their medical records, including patient demographic data and the clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cases where <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> had occurred, the course of hospital treatment was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ESD-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> were divided into macroperforations and microperforations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A macroperforation was defined as a gross <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> that occurred during an ESD procedure and a microperforation was defined by free air visible on X-rays after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 101 enrolled patients, 9 (8.9 %) developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333132" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was nongranular-type LST (5 of 9 cases, 55.6 %) based on endoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five patients had microperforations and four had macroperforations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> macroperforations were closed primarily by endoclips during ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic characteristics did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the length of hospital stay and the mean duration of NPO and antibiotic treatments were longer for microperforation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had conservative nonsurgical management such as fasting, intravenous antibiotics, and nasogastric tube drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical complications for microperforation patients were worse than those for macroperforation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical prognoses of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> that occur during colonic ESD are favorable </plain></SENT>
