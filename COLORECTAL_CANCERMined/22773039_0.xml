<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, MSP58 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 499 specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between various clinicopathological features and overall patient survival rate was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of MSP58 expression with the 499 CRC patients' survival rate was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using ROC curve to provide sensitivity and specificity of the score of MSP58 predicts local recurrence and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of MSP58 was positively correlated with the depth of invasion (P &lt; 0.001), local recurrence (P = 0.008), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (P = 0.002), and UICC stage (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that the survival time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with low expression of MSP58 was longer than those with high expression during the 5-year follow-up period (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>COX regression analysis indicated that high expression of MSP58 (P &lt; 0.001), depth of invasion &gt;pT(1) (P = 0.008), distant organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (pM(1)) (P &lt; 0.001), regional lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (â‰¥ pN(1)) (P &lt; 0.001), and local recurrence (Yes) (P = 0.007) were independent, poor prognostic factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ROC curve showed the score of MSP58 expression level did provide a maximal sensitivity and specificity to predict local recurrence and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated MSP58 might serve as a novel prognostic marker that is independent of, and additive to, the UICC staging system </plain></SENT>
