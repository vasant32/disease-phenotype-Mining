<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This health disparity is partially explained by low participation in screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify factors influencing adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telephone interviews were conducted with African Americans living in Maryland (57% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 504 respondents agreed to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survey primarily assessed participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, health beliefs and attitudes about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, and demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nearly 77% of respondents reported being adherent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those not adherent, nearly 50% reported not ever receiving a physician recommendation to be screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Having health insurance was a strong correlate of adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Study participants with greater perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were more likely to be adherent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, those who reported that they were caregivers were less likely to be adherent to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Findings indicate that those who were the primary care takers of children or disabled persons were less likely to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Efforts are needed to ensure that caregivers do not neglect their own preventive health, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further, access to care and health insurance coverage also appear to be an important factor for participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ensuring that those who do not have adequate healthcare coverage are not excluded from participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening due to cost should be an important priority if reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> health disparity is to be achieved </plain></SENT>
