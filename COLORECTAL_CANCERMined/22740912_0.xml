<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the optimal use of current chemotherapy in multimodality therapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 208 patients with unresectable primary and metastatic (recurrent) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent chemotherapy in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation and/or secondary surgery were used depending on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease sites varied among patients and included unresectable liver, lung and peritoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy produced cytoreduction in 71 of 208 patients (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multimodality cytoreduction increased overall survival to a median of 46.0 months vs. 20.2 months with chemotherapy alone (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rate to chemotherapy was independently associated with cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular targeted therapy reduced the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells sooner than conventional chemotherapy, and correlated with repeated cytoreduction that further prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aggressive chemotherapy as initial treatment for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> leads to cytoreduction and is associated with extended survival in patients receiving multimodality therapy </plain></SENT>
