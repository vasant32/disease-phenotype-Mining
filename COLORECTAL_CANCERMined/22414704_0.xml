<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested an important role for dietary fibre (DF) of cereals in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to explain the effects of the DF of barley Rihane (BR) on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) and colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> diversity in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following an acclimatisation period, rats were divided into four groups and fed a control (C) diet or experimental diet containing 30 % of BR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DF content in the experimental diet was twice that of the C diet (total DF was 8·69 % in the C diet and 15·24 % in the BR diet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 7 and 8 weeks of age, rats received two successive subcutaneous injections of AOM at 20 mg/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12 weeks after the first injection, ten animals from each group were killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BR diet decreased colonic pH (P &lt; 0·05) compared with the C diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total number of ACF observed decreased considerably in the BR/AOM group compared with the C/AOM group (P &lt; 0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of similarity coefficients showed variability of colonic microbiota species between the different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we showed inter-individual variability within the same group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This similarity was affected by BR and AOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present results show that bifidobacteria numbers were lower in rats fed the BR diet compared with those fed the C diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the number of enterobacteria in colonic content was increased (P &lt; 0·05) in the BR group compared with the C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results from the present study show that the DF of BR reduced the incidence of AOM-induced ACF and increased microbiota biodiversity </plain></SENT>
