<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> are potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, potentially facilitating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies examining <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk are few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the association between use of systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, both overall and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage (localised versus metastatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a nested population-based case-control study in Northern Denmark (1.8 million people) using medical registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included 14,158 patients with a first-time diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 1991 through 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using risk set sampling, we identified 141,580 population controls, matched on age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequent use of systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> (defined as &gt;2 prescriptions) was not associated with overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk [adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85-1.00)], compared with never/rare use (â‰¤2 prescriptions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associations according to duration of use and doses (quartiles of cumulative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> equivalents) were also near the null </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by stage, no substantial associations were found between long-term use (&gt;5 years) of high-dose (&gt;5500 mg) systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and localised [aOR = 1.12 (95% CI: 0.81-1.55)] or metastatic [aOR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.59-1.14)] <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite immunological and metabolic effects of frequent use of systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, which would be expected to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, we found no substantial association between the two </plain></SENT>
