<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Observational studies and randomized trials have suggested that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> may lower the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inherited variation in the <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex-hormone</z:chebi> genes may be one mechanism by which sex hormones affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, although data are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding 3 hormone receptors (ESR1, ESR2, PGR) and 5 hormone synthesizers (CYP19A1 and CYP17A1, HSD17B1, HSD17B2, HSD17B4) among 427 women with incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 871 matched controls who were Caucasians of European ancestry from 93676 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 242 haplotype-tagging and functional SNPs in the 8 genes were included for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for age and hysterectomy status was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a weak association between the CYP17A1 rs17724534 SNP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (OR per risk allele (A) = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.09-1.78, corrected p-value = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a suggestive interaction between rs17724534 and rs10883782 in 2 discrete LD blocks of CYP17A1 was observed in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (empirical p value = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, one haplotype block of CYP19A1 was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (corrected global p value = 0.02), which likely reflected the association with the tagging SNP, rs1902584, in the block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings offer some support for a suggestive association of CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 variants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
