<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aims of this multicenter study were to evaluate patient experience and satisfaction with CTC screening and compare preference against screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-question survey instrument measuring pretest choice, experience, and satisfaction was given to a consecutive cohort of adults undergoing CTC screening in three disparate screening settings: university academic center, military medical center, and community practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study cohort was composed of individuals voluntarily participating in clinical CTC screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1417 patients responded to the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The top reasons for choosing CTC for screening included "noninvasiveness" (68.0%), "avoidance of sedation/anesthesia" (63.1%), "ability to drive after the test" (49.2%), "avoidance of optical colonoscopy risks" (46.9%), and "identifying abnormalities outside the colon" (43.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 7.2% of patients reported pain during the CTC examination and only 2.5% reported greater than moderate discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 441 patients who had experienced both CTC and optical colonoscopy, 77.1% preferred CTC and 13.8% preferred optical colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 29.6% indicated that they may not have undergone optical colonoscopy screening if CTC were not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 92.9% labeled their overall experience with CTC as "excellent" or "good," and 93.0% indicated they would choose CTC for their next screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Respondents reported a very high satisfaction level with CTC, and those who had experienced both modalities indicated a preference for CTC over optical colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CTC has the potential to increase adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines if widely available </plain></SENT>
