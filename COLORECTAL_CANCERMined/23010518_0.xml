<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Trends in current epidemiological data suggest that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> is changing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eastern Europe previously was seen as a low incidence area; however, new data confirm that incidence and prevalence are quickly increasing in some countries, reaching moderate-to-high incidence as reported in Western European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quality of the studies also improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, data became available on the natural history of the disease from Eastern European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current trends are similar to those reported from Western Europe and North America, including less complicated disease at diagnosis, accelerated use of immunomodulators and decreased need for surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, more cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> and relatively low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in-depth analysis of disease course enabled the identification of possible predictive factors leading to some novel findings, such as the association between the decline in surgery risk and early treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, some unexplained differences exist, such as the low overall colectomy risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
