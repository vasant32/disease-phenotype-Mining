<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a possible association of MLH1 -93G&gt;A and 655A&gt;G and XRCC1 Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Mexican patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA samples were obtained from peripheral blood of 108 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (study group) at diagnosis and 120 blood donors (control group) from Western Mexico; both groups were mestizos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms were detected by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association was estimated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the MLH1 and XRCC1 polymorphisms were in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MLH1 655A&gt;G polymorphism in the 655G allele was associated with a 2-fold increase risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 2.04 and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.12-3.69; P &lt; 0.01), while the MLH1 -93G&gt;A polymorphism allele was associated with a protective effect (OR = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.40-0.89; P = 0.01 in the -93A allele and OR = 0.32, 95%CI = 0.13-0.79; P = 0.01 in the AA genotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The XRCC1 Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms did not show any significant associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that MLH1 -93G&gt;A and 655A&gt;G polymorphisms are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Mexican patients </plain></SENT>
