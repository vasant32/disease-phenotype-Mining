<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimum management algorithm is yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors of survival and to determine the operative benefit of resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> followed by chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients who presented with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 1999 to 2007 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The demographics and clinicopathological characteristics of these patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis assessed independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the surgical management of the primary, 79% (n = 572) were performed electively, 18% (n = 134) as an emergency procedure and 3% (n = 22) did not have any surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent (n = 78) had a permanent stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major morbidity was 4.3% (n = 31), and 30-day mortality was low at 6% (n = 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten percent (n = 71) had a subsequent metasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent curative resections tended to be female (p = 0.05), of a younger age group (age, ≤ 50; p = 0.005), as well as had better <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (p = 0.0001) and albumin levels (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the study cohort, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (CSS) at 1 year was 47.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 44.2-51.6%], 3-year CSS was 10.8% (95% CI, 3.3-13.3%) and 5-year CSS was 7.0% (95% CI, 4.8-9.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CSS was significantly higher in patients that underwent colonic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In cases where resection of the primary was possible, multivariate analysis revealed that CEA value &gt;40 ng/ml, low albumin levels ≤ 34 g/l, poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage (T3/T4), nodal disease (N1/N2) and presence of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant factors associated with poorer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study has shown a good survival benefit in stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> when an aggressive policy of primary resection is adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> with curative intent should be performed whenever possible </plain></SENT>
