<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs are endogenous small noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of ADAM-17 (a desintegrin and metalloproteases 17) as a novel multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) mechanism in multidrug-resistant colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and the role of miR-222 in the development of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the high expression of ADAM-17, which results in growth factor shedding and growth factor receptor activation could induce drug resistance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of ADAM-17, in conjunction with chemotherapy, may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ADAM-17 is a predicted target of miR-222, which was downregulated in multidrug-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of miR-222 was consistently inversely proportionate to the expression levels of ADAM-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that elevated levels of miR-222 in the mimics-transfected HCT116/L-OHP and HCT-8/VCR cells reduced the ADAM-17 protein level and the luciferase activity of an ADAM-17 3' untranslated region-based reporter and sensitized these cells' <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to some anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that miR-222 could play a role in the development of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> by modulation of ADAM-17, the new <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> treatment target in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
