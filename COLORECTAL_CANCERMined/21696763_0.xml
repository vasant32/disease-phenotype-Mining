<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Integration of multidisciplinary care is critical to accomplish excellent oncologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the establishment of a dedicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> center (CRCC) around specialty-trained surgeons will lead to increased multidisciplinary management and improved outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from three periods: a baseline group, a period after the recruitment of specialty-trained surgeons, and a period after the creation of a dedicated multidisciplinary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data analyzed included surrogate markers of surgical oncologic care, multidisciplinary integration, and oncologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recruitment of specialized surgeons led to improvements in surgical oncologic care; the establishment of the CRCC resulted in further improvements in surgical oncologic care and multidisciplinary integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that although the recruitment of specialty-trained surgeons in a high volume center leads to improvement in surgical oncologic care, it is the establishment of a multidisciplinary center around the surgeons that leads to integrated care and improvements in oncologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
