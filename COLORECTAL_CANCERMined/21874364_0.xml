<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guided, in part, by the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, this study examined the associations between predisposing, enabling, and need factors with self-reported breast, cervical, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were 319 Mexican-American women, from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds, living near the United States-Mexico border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women were adherent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC) screening (≥42 years) if they had received at least one mammogram within the last 2 years, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> (CC) screening (≥40 years) if they had received at least one Pap exam in the last 3 years, and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening (≥52 years) if they had undergone one or more of the following: Fecal Occult Blood Test within the last year, or sigmoidoscopy in the last 5 years, or colonoscopy within the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BC and CC screenings were higher in the current sample compared to national and state figures: 82% with mammography and 86% adherent with Pap exam screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, only 43% were adherent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characteristics associated with mammography adherence included CC adherence and usual source of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BC adherence was associated to CC adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Characteristics associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> adherence included BC adherence, being premenopausal, and insurance coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A key correlate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening adherence was adherence to other preventive services </plain></SENT>
