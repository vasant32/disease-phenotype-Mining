<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy combined with an enhanced recovery pathway (ERP) is widely considered to be the first-choice option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no previous reports have focused on patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) treated by laparoscopy and ERP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with CD underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection with an ERP at two institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ERP protocol included no bowel preparation nor fasting, no nasogastric tube, no abdominal drains, early removal of urinary catheter, early solid dietary intake and mobilization, opioid-sparing <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> and restrictive fluid management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This group was compared with a matched historical control group of 70 CD patients who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection treated with conventional care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compliance with the ERP was high (≥80 %) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> items except no drain placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly earlier return of bowel function (time to first flatus and stool) was observed in the ERP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean postoperative and total length of stay were significantly shorter in the ERP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported experience of laparoscopy with ERP in CD patients and suggests that optimized perioperative care combined with minimally invasive techniques may lead to further improvements in surgical outcomes for CD patients </plain></SENT>
