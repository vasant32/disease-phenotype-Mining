<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Early detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> is important for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been few studies to investigate the relationship between colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (FHCRC) in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and FHCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2009 and September 2010, 225 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their medical records with clinical history and size, numbers, histology of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining using Bcl-2, Bax, p-AKT, NF-κB, and β-catenin antibodies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the histology of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and expression of immunohistochemical staining according to the existence of FHCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> increased in case of FHCRC (p=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with FHCRC, the mean age of patients was 49 years old and younger than patients without FHCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition in patients with FHCRC, the incidence of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was significantly higher than in patients without FHCRC (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bax was significantly lower in patients with FHCRC than without FHCRC (p=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a tendency for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> to develop in their younger ages and to be more advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in patients with FHCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The low expression of Bax, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, might be associated with the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in patient with FHCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients with FHCRC may be better to start screening colonoscopy earlier than patient without FHCRC </plain></SENT>
