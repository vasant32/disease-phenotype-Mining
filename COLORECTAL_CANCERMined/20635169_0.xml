<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study analyzed polymorphisms of HIF-1α gene and their impact on the prognosis for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and forty-five consecutive patients with surgically resected colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNA was extracted from fresh colorectal tissue, and 2 polymorphisms of HIF-1α gene (HIF-1α C1772T and HIF-1α G1790A) determined using a real-time PCR genotyping assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 HIF-1α gene polymorphisms were successfully amplified, and the frequencies of each genotype are as follows: [C1772T: CC (92.1%), CT (7.9%); G1790A: GG (93.0%), GA (7.0%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis including stage, age, site of disease, and CEA level showed that these polymorphisms were not associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the clinicopathologic parameters, CEA level and TNM stage were significant prognostic factors in a Cox model for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HIF-1α gene polymorphisms investigated in this study were not found to be an independent prognostic marker for Korean patients with surgically resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are warranted to clarify the role of HIF-1α gene polymorphisms as a prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
