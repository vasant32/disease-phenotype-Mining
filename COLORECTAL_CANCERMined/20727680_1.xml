<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 51-year-old woman with pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with enteric differentiation (PAED) that is indistinguishable from metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> by immunohistochemistry as well as histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A chest computed tomography scan revealed a 1cm nodule in the right upper lobe and a 3cm mass in the left lower lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial examination showed no evidence of any other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She underwent partial resection of the right upper lobe and left lower lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination revealed that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were composed of medium to large complex glands with central <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were cuboidal to tall columnar with eosinophilc cytoplasm, oval nuclei, and brush-border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study yielded the following results: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were diffusely positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2, and negative for CK7, thyroid transcription factor-1, and Napsin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MUC2 was partially observed, while MUC5AC was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were strongly indicative of metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was detected in any clinical examination, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">fluorine 18</z:chebi>-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography scan and video capsule endoscopy, and she has not presented with any characteristic symptoms at any follow-up to date, approximately 4 years after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features, the final diagnosis was primary PAED, suggestive of multifocal primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>So far, only 1 case of CK7-negative PAED has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the second case of primary PAED resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> morphologically and immunohistologically </plain></SENT>
