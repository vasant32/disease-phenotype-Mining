<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, genetic polymorphisms affecting the capability of initiating these responses may be critical for the subsequent efficiency of avoiding and/or eliminating possible threats to the organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a tagging approach in the region of Taste Receptor 2R38 (TAS2R38) gene, we investigated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the common genetic variation of this gene region in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk with a case-control study in a German population (709 controls and 602 cases) and in a Czech population (623 controls and 601 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that there were no significant associations between individual SNPs of the TAS2R38 gene and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Czech or in the German population, nor in the joint analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when we analyzed the diplotypes and the phenotypes we found that the non-taster group had an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in comparison to the taster group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association was borderline significant in the Czech population, (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.99-1.67; P(value) = 0.058) and statistically significant in the German population (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.75; P(value) = 0.016) and in the joint analysis (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.12-1.61; P(value) = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found a suggestive association between the human bitter tasting phenotype and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in two different populations of Caucasian origin </plain></SENT>
