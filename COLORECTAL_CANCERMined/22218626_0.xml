<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Only about half of eligible Americans are adherent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because patients generally access <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening via their primary care physicians, interventions to improve screening should be tested in the primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article describes the recruitment and baseline characteristics of patients from 16 practice-based research network practices for a study to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 8327 invitations were mailed to patients of these practices, and 1685 returned consent forms and baseline surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of those who consented, 942 were up to date with screening, which indicates that office databases were unable to provide information about those who were already screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 743 due for screening were younger (mean age, 61 vs. 63 years), less likely to have an immediate family member with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (11% vs. 19%), less likely to have Medicare (29% vs. 40%), more likely to have no insurance (5% vs. 1%), and less likely to report a physician/nurse recommendation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (63% vs. 92%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experiences for this practice-based research network randomized clinical intervention trial may be useful to others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Practice and patient recruitment processes were onerous with institutional review board issues, poorly prepared patient databases, and discarding of mail by the US Postal Service </plain></SENT>
