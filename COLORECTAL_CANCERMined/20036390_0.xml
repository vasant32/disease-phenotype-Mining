<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytotoxic activity was determined by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>-assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three different administration schedules of the two drugs were compared and median effect isobologram analysis was applied to the results, to determine the presence of synergism, additive effects, or antagonism as described by Chou and Talalay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resistance to melphalan did not correspond to resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> combinations of melphalan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> showed synergistic or additive interaction in the majority of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hour of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> followed by 1h of melphalan showed the lowest percentage of cell viability, with synergy in 10 out of 13 cell lines at 50% cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous treatment showed the highest cell viability, with antagonism in six cell lines, additivity in two cell lines, synergism in five cell lines at 50% cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hour of melphalan followed by 1h of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> showed synergy in six cell lines, antagonism in another six, and additivity in one cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a schedule-dependent synergistic interaction between melphalan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> should be considered as a new, potentially valuable additional agent to the currently commonly used melphalan in isolated hepatic perfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
