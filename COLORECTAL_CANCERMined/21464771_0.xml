<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Thirty-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (male 17, female 14) visited the stoma-care clinic, akita university hospital between april 2003 and march 2006. fourteen patients (male 8, female 6) had been observed continuously for more than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Results of 5 male patients who received systemic chemotherapy using S-1 were compared to those of 9 male and female patients who did not receive S-1. the shades of epidermal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> at the peristomal area were graded on a 3-point likert scale, where grade 2 indicated very dark <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo>, grade 1 indicated moderately dark <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo>, and grade 0 indicated no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> of the peristomal skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>Pigmentation</z:hpo> scores in patients receiving S-1 were significantly higher than scores in patients who did not receive S-1 systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> of the peristomal skin may occur in patients receiving S-1 systemic chemotherapy because it indicates an adverse event related with systemic chemotherapy and leads to peristomal skin problems </plain></SENT>
