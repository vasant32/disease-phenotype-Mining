<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore TP gene expression in relation to clinical and histopathological data obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: TP gene expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and mucosa samples from 254 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TP gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> correlated with lymph node staging, with higher expression relating to a higher number of positive nodes and a worse N-stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher TP expression was also associated with a worse histological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> had significantly higher TP expression in mucosa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> compared with patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher intratumoral TP expression appears to be related to a worse N stage, and thus, with a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TP gene expression measured in a preoperative biopsy could be of interest in preoperative staging </plain></SENT>
