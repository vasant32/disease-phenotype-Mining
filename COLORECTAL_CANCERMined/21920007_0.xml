<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to compare 5-year survival rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients who underwent potentially curative surgery before and after the introduction of the 2-week wait (2WW) referral system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data were collected retrospectively from a prospectively maintained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> database for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent surgery in 1999 (pre-2WW group, n = 150) and 2002 (post-2WW group, n = 126) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented as an emergency, those who died within 30 days of surgery and those who presented with incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the Kaplan-Meier method to plot survival curves and the log rank test to compare survival rates between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates in the pre-2WW and post-2WW groups did not differ significantly (71%vs 72%, respectively; P = 0.880) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who presented via urgent pathways was higher in the post-2WW group than in the pre-2WW group (77%vs 38%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, owing to this change in the referral pattern, the overall delay between referral and treatment was significantly lower in the post-2WW group than in the pre-2WW group (median 76 days vs 115, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 2WW referral system for patients with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> does not translate into improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, more patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are being referred via urgent pathways </plain></SENT>
