<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens from 99 patients were retrospectively analyzed by immunohistochemistry for metallothionein and p53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were generated according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate survival distributions were compared with the use of the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This research was approved by the institutional review boards of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> showing concomitant high metallothionein expression and negative p53 (metallothionein(H)/p53(-)) were significantly inversely related to depth of invasion, frequency of nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and Dukes stage (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, patients with metallothionein(H)/p53(-) phenotype showed a better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.83; P &lt; .05) and disease-free survival (HR, 2.03; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, considering staging, metallothionein, and metallothionein + p53 variables, in 83 patients with Dukes stages B and C, metallothionein(H)/p53(-) combination was the sole factor showing an independent prognostic value for overall survival (HR, 3.88; P &lt; .1) and disease-free survival (HR, 2.56; P &lt; .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combined analysis of metallothionein and p53 may enhance the prognostic power of each individual marker by predicting the progression of the disease and contributing to a better identification of patients at low risk for mortality, especially for those with Dukes stage B and C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
