<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sessile marine animals such as sponges, ascidians, and bryozoans are a rich source of bioactive <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi>, many of which exhibit potent anticancer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted and purified a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> with potent antitumor activity from Ciona savignyi by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> fractionation, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, gel chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was used to study the cytotoxicity of the isolated fraction and the purified <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle and Western blot analysis were performed to study the mode of action of the purified <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> with potent antitumor activity was purified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, designated CS5931, was 5931 Da, and use of the genome basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) revealed that the N-terminal sequence of CS5931 is identical to that of granulin A from C savignyi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CS5931 exhibited significant cytotoxicity for several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell types and induced apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in HCT-8 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that CS5931 caused cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase, and a sub-G(1) peak appeared after treating the cells with CS5931 for 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-mediated pathway was implicated in CS5931-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our observations clearly demonstrate the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> CS5931 from C savignyi and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-mediated pathway involved in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
