<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The evidence for a role of tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and body mass index (BMI) in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153425" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">small intestine cancer</z:e> is based mainly on case-control studies from Europe and United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We harmonized the data across 12 cohort studies from mainland China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, comprising over 500,000 subjects followed for an average of 10.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for BMI and (only among men) tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 134 incident cases were observed (49 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid</z:hpo>, 46 other histologic types, and 28 of unknown histology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically non-significant trend toward increased HR in subjects with high BMI [HR for BMI&gt;27.5 kg/m2, compared with 22.6-25.0, 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-2.96] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association was suggested for tobacco smoking; men drinking&gt;400 g of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> per week had an HR of 1.57 (95% CI 0.66-3.70), compared with abstainers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the hypothesis that elevated BMI may be a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153425" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">small intestine cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An etiologic role of alcohol drinking was suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results reinforce the existing evidence that the epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153425" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">small intestine cancer</z:e> resembles that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
