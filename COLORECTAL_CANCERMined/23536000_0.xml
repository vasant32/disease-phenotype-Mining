<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>c-Met plays an important role in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and disease progression and thus is believed to be an attractive inhibitory target for receptor molecular therapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SU11274 was identified as a small molecule, ATP competitive inhibitor of the catalytic activity of the c-Met kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study had investigated the relationship between the high expression of c-Met and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and the effect of c-Met inhibitor SU11274 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in vitro and vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of c-Met in 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 20 patients with benign <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and surrounding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of SU11274 on human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> LoVo cells was detected by Western blot and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And the influence of SU11274 on cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, LoVo cell-transplanted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and expression of c-Met in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice was examined for inhibition of SU11274 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found c-Met had high expression and was closely related to lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and TNM stage in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SU11274 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as the survival and proliferation of LoVo cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G1-phase arrest was also induced by SU11274 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SU11274 apparently restrained the growth of the xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest developing therapies that specifically inhibit the activation of c-Met may represent a novel therapeutic modality for patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> expressing high levels of c-Met </plain></SENT>
