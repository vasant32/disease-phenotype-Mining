<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in two groups of patients, observed for 5 and 10 years, in whom the levels of these proteins were previously measured by enzyme immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High level of PAI-1 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (≥4.0 ng/mg protein) was found to be a significant, but not independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall 5- and 10-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of this factor was mainly significant in patients with stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High preoperative plasma levels of MMP-7 and TIMP-1 (threshold values 4.0 and 347 ng/ml, respectively) were independent unfavorable prognostic factors, while in unifactorial analysis, high level of MMP-7 (≥7.8 ng/mg protein) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of patients with disseminated process was olso an unfavorable prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
