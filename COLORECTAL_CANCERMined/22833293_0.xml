<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probability of relapse is currently predicted from pathological staging, there being a need for additional markers to further select high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to identify a gene-expression signature to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence in patients with Stages II and III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> treated with 5'fluoruracil (5FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-hundred and twenty-eight patients diagnosed with Stages II-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and treated with surgical resection and 5FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples and expression of 27 selected candidate genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence predicting model, including clinico-pathological variables and gene-expression profiling, was developed by Cox regression analysis and validated by bootstrapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regression analysis identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and S100A2 and S100A10 gene expression as independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk score derived from this model was able to discriminate two groups with a highly significant different probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence (HR, 2.75; 95%CI, 1.71-4.39; p = 0.0001), which it was maintained when patients were stratified according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The algorithm was also able to distinguish two groups with different overall survival (HR, 2.68; 95%CI, 1.12-6.42; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identification of a new gene-expression signature associated with a high probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence in patients with Stages II and III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> receiving adjuvant 5FU-based chemotherapy, and its combination in a robust, easy-to-use and reliable algorithm may contribute to tailor treatment and surveillance strategies </plain></SENT>
