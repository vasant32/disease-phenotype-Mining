<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this experiment, we investigated the optimal combination schedule and antitumor activity of oral S-1 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> combination therapy (SOX) against human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> xenografts in vivo </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antitumor activity of SOX, administered according to the divided schedule was significantly superior to both monotherapies (p&lt;0.01), and the toxicity was tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, administration on day 8 alone failed to significantly increase the antitumor activity, when compared with that of monotherapy, while administration on day 1 alone was toxic in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, the efficacy of SOX was compared with that of COX (360 mg/kg, days 1-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antitumor effect of SOX was significantly superior to that of COX (p&lt;0.01), with an equivalent toxicity; moreover SOX suppressed COL-1 tumor growth for a longer period of time (2.2 times) than did COX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antitumor activity of SOX against the 5-FU-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line KM12C/5-FU was equivalent to that of COX </plain></SENT>
