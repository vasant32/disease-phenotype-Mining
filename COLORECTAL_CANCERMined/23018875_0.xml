<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the inter-observer agreement of a novel 10-high-power-fields method for assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding at the invasive front and to confirm the prognostic value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding in our setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole tissue sections of 215 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with full clinico-pathological and follow-up information were stained with cytokeratin AE1/AE3 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presence of buds was scored across 10-high-power fields at the invasive front by two pathologists and two additional observers were asked to score 50 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding randomly selected from the larger cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measurements were correlated to the patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer agreement and correlation between observers' scores were excellent (P&lt;0.0001; intraclass correlation coefficient=0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A test subgroup of 65 patients (30%) was used to define a valid cutoff score for high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding and the remaining 70% of the patients were entered into the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-grade budding was defined as an average of â‰¥10 buds across 10-high-power fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-grade budding was associated with a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (P&lt;0.0001), higher TNM stage (P=0.0003), vascular invasion (P&lt;0.0001), infiltrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> border configuration (P&lt;0.0001) and reduced survival (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed its independent prognostic effect (P=0.007) when adjusting for TNM stage and adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using 10-high-power fields for evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding has independent prognostic value and shows excellent inter-observer agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Like the BRE and Gleason scores in breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo>, respectively, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding could be a basis for a prognostic score in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
