<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CCR) in Chile has nearly doubled over the past 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>International studies have shown that CCR screening programs based on fecal occult blood test (FOBT) reduce CCR mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim: To analyze the results from a CCR screening model in people over 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2009, a prospective multicenter study was performed in seven major Chilean cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FOBT using an immunological method, was measured in asymptomatic subjects aged 50 years or more, without risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with a positive FOBT, with symptoms or with family risk factors, a colonoscopy was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6348 subjects were assessed, FOBT was performed in 4938 of them, with a compliance of 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result was positive in 9.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 2359 colonoscopies were ordered, with an overall compliance of 50.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 1184 colonoscopies performed, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and high risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were found in 304 (26%) and 75 (6%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were diagnosed with stage I and IICCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of these lesions were excised endoscopically and 10 surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, high risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 75, 12 and 2 per 1000 screened individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This program allowed the early detection of an important number of high risk colon lesions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CCR were diagnosed at early stages </plain></SENT>
