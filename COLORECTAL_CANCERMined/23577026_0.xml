<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, the expression profiles of genes within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and their relationship to clinicopathological factors must be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we selected 10 genes (TS, DPD, TP, FPGS, GGH, DHFR, ERCC1, TOPO-1, VEGF, and EGFR), examined differences in their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression between the upper and lower thirds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by laser-captured microdissection and real-time RT-PCR (the Danenberg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> profile), and analyzed the relationships between their expression profiles and clinicopathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of DPD, TP, and VEGF was significantly higher in the lower third than in the upper third of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P = 0.044, 0.023, and 0.013, resp.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increased ERCC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the lower third of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> correlated with recurrence (P = 0.049), and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly higher in cases with recurrence than in cases without recurrence, both in the upper and lower thirds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P = 0.018 and 0.036, resp.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results implied that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in DPD, TP, and VEGF expression may exist in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and that ERCC-1 and VEGF may be markers predicting recurrence after curative operation </plain></SENT>
