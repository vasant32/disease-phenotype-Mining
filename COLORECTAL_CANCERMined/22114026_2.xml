<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The short half-life protooncogene β-catenin acquires a remarkable stability in a large subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, mainly from mutations affecting its proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this sense, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) form a group of pathologies in which early steps of development are characterized by an aberrant expression of β-catenin and an uncontrolled proliferation of epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diet has long been described as an influence in the emergence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but the molecular events that link <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Part of the explanation may reside in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamine</z:chebi> biosynthetic pathway (HBP) flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that fasted mice being force-fed with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> leads to an increase of β-catenin and O-GlcNAcylation levels in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MCF7 cells possessing intact Wnt/β-catenin signaling heavily expressed β-catenin when cultured in high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>; this was reversed by the HBP inhibitor azaserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HBP inhibition also decreased the expression of β-catenin in HT29 and, to a lesser extent, HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same observation was made with regard to the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of HBP also blocked the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-mediated proliferation capacity of MCF7 cells, demonstrating that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> affects both β-catenin expression and cell proliferation through the HBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ultimate element conducting these events is the dynamic posttranslational modification O-GlcNAcylation, which is intimately linked to HBP; the modulation of its level affected the expression of β-catenin and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In accordance with our findings, we propose that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> correlate to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> via an upregulation of HBP that reverberates on high O-GlcNAcylation levels including modification of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
