<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Wnt target LGR5 has been recently identified as a murine intestinal stem cell marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its role during each stage of human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: LGR5 expression was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis in 17 low-grade and 13 high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and 30 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of LGR5-positive cells increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, with clustering of the cells to form patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An apparent difference in their distribution among the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> stages was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LGR5 expression in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface showed a negative association with the progressive grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, while that in lower crypt exhibited a positive association with grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp>, LGR5 expression in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface was negatively associated with pStage, while it was almost invariably high in lower crypt during advanced pStage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the shifts in the distribution of LGR5-positive cells towards the lower crypt play a role in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
