<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Role of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been recently investigated worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this population-based study, we evaluated the incidence rates and distribution of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in genetically isolated population from Sardinia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 2009 to July 2011, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (N = 478) were prospectively collected from Sardinian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients at clinics across the entire island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from tissue sections and screened for mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes by automated DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> mutation rate was 30% (145/478 positive cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distribution of mutation carriers was surprisingly different within the island: 87/204 (43%) in North Sardinia vs. 58/274 (21%) in Middle-South Sardinia (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 384 CRC cases whose DNA was available, only one (0.3%) patient carried a mutation in BRAF gene; PIK3CA was found mutated in 67 (17%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse distribution of PIK3CA mutation rates was observed within Sardinian population: 19/183 (10%) cases from northern vs. 48/201 (24%) cases from central-southern island (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in frequencies of KRAS/PIK3CA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> is consistent with already-reported discrepancies in distribution of germline mutations for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> within Sardinian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preliminary clinical evaluation of 118 KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients undergoing anti-EGFR-based treatment indicated lack of role for PIK3CA in predicting response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that differences in patients' origins and related genetic backgrounds may contribute to even determine the incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> genes </plain></SENT>
