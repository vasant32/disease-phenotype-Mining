<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background Sex differences in epidemiological, clinical and pathological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> have been under intensive investigation for the last three decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that most of the sex-related differences reported were also age-related, this study sought to determine the potential effect of a sex-age interaction on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Material and Methods Statistical data on sex- and age-specific colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> incidence, disease stage and survival for white persons were derived from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-specific incidence rates in 2002-2006 were analyzed by 5-year age groups (45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84 years) in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex differences were measured by calculating rate differences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Equivalent analyses for a similar time period were performed for stage distribution and 5-year relative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results Age-specific incidence rates were higher for men, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> life-time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of the male predominance was age-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RR and RD did not remain constant over time: they increased gradually with age, peaked at 70-74 years, and declined thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The distribution of stage at diagnosis was similar between men and women, but women seemed to have better survival, until the age of 64 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 74 years for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions There seem to be significant age-related sex differences in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and maybe also in its prognosis </plain></SENT>
