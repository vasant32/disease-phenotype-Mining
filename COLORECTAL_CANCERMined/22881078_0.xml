<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to asses our initial first experience with NOSE techniques in laparoscopic colorectal surgery with both transanal and transvaginal extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study, the authors analyzed data from patients in whom NOSE laparoscopic sigmoid, rectosigmoid and rectal resections were performed in the Department of Surgery, University Hospital Ostrava, from May 2011 to October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 7 patients was analyzed based on demographic characteristics (sex,age and BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> localization, type of extraction (transanal/transvaginal), the number of removed lymph nodes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, histology and length of the specimen were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the following intraoperative data were evaluated: duration of the procedure, frequency of intraoperative complications and conversion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the postoperative period, duration of hospitalization and morbidity rates were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient group included 2 male (28.6%) and 5 female (71.4%) subjects, their median age was 70 years (61-80), BMI 26,76 (24.76-34.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathology was located in the sigmoid colon in 4 cases (57.1%) and in the proximal rectum in 3 cases (42.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transanal extraction was performed in 5 patients (71.4%) and transvaginal extraction in 2 patients (28.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average number of harvested lymph nodes was 13 (10-15), the average lenght of specimen was 16 cm (13-20) and the average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 4 cm (2-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was confirmed in 6 cases (85.7%), and low grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> in 1 case (14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median duration of surgery was 205 min (140-300) and no intraoperative complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No surgical conversion was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No postoperative complications occured and the median duration of of hospital stay was 7 days (5-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONSLUSION: In the selected group of patients, NOSE technique proved to be a safe technique for laparoscopic colorectal procedures, reducing the risk of incisional complications while maintaining the principles of oncological radicality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be considered a bridge towards NOTES (Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery), surgery without scars </plain></SENT>
