<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a population-based trial to determine whether nonparticipants in flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening were willing to attend faecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 8,407 subjects were invited in a primary FS screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Invitees did not know at the time of FS invitation that nonparticipants would be offered FIT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 4,407 nonparticipants of FS screening were invited for FIT screening (cut-off 50 ng <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The participation rate to FS screening was 31% [95% confidence interval (CI): 30-32%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the FS nonparticipants 25% (CI: 24-26%) did attended FIT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The participation rate of the two-stage recruitment for FS and FIT screening was 45% (CI: 44-46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FIT screenees were older (p = 0.02), more often women (p &lt; 0.001) and had a lower social economic status (p = 0.01) than FS screenees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detection rate (DR) for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was 3.5% (CI: 2.5-4.8%), and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) it was 0.3% (CI: 0.1-0.8%) among participants to FIT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The DR of the two-stage recruitment was 6.1% (n = 202) for an advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and 0.5% (n = 16) for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, offering FIT screening to nonparticipants in a FS screening programme increases the overall participation rate considerably, as a quarter of nonparticipants of FS screening was willing to attend FIT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The participation rate remains lower for primary FIT screening in the same population (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Women in the target population were more likely to refuse FS than FIT screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Countries introducing FS screening should be aware of these preferences </plain></SENT>
