<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because colon length and location change after colorectal resection, factors affecting insertion time during colonoscopy also might be altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine whether colonoscope insertion time differs between left-sided resection and right-sided resection and to identify factors that impact the performance of colonoscopy after colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy between November 2005 and November 2009 after colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We classified surgical methods into left-sided resection (left hemicolectomy, low anterior resection, anterior resection, Hartman, and Mile's operation) or right-sided resection (right hemicolectomy) and retrospectively evaluated the colonoscope insertion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we analyzed factors that might affect the insertion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,260 patients underwent colonoscopy after colorectal resection during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 1,248 patients (771 men) who underwent complete colonoscopy were evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The colonoscopy completion rate was 99%, and the mean insertion time was 6.5Â±5.1 min (median, 5 min; range, 0.3-61 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Right-sided resection, female gender, poor quality of bowel preparation, lower endoscopist case volume, open laparotomy, and colonoscopy performed more than 1 year after colorectal resection were found to be independent factors associated with prolonged insertion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large study identified six factors that affect colonoscope insertion time after colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for the practice and teaching of colonoscopy after colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
