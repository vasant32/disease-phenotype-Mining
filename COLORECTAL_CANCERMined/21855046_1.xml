<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with previously untreated advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> at 1000 mg/m(2) twice a day on days 1-5 and days 8-12 of a 14-day cycle, and OHP at 85 mg/m(2) and bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of unacceptable toxicities, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose was reduced to 850 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one additional patients were treated at the lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment continued until disease progression, persistent intolerable toxicity, or physician and/or patient discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, toxicities were better managed and tolerated at the 850 mg/-m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment-related grade â‰¥ 3 toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first 19 subjects, the response rate was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-84%) and 5 patients had stable disease; median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.1 months (95% CI, 5.7-19.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent 31 patients, the response was 42% (95% CI, 25%-61%); 11 patients had stable disease and median PFS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 6.9-15.4); median overall survival was 24.8 months (95% CI, 12.9-39.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> at 850 mg/m(2) twice a day on days 1-5 and days 8-12 and OHP at 85 mg/m(2)and bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 14 days is clinically active in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile of this regimen is consistent with the standard every-3-week dosing schedule </plain></SENT>
