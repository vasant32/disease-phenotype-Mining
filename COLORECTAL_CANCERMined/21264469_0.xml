<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the incidence of symptomatic VTE in Korean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients following surgery, and to identify the associated risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients who developed symptomatic VTE after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery between 2006 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>Deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was diagnosed with Doppler ultrasound or contrast venography, and PE was identified with lung ventilation/perfusion scans or chest computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis, including low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression, was used in patients considered at high risk of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 3,645 patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery, 31 (0.85%) developed symptomatic VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those 31 patients, 23 (74.2%) had DVT, 16 (51.6%) had PE, and 8 (25.8%) had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients died from PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that a history of VTE, pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e>, transfusions, postoperative immobilization time, and postoperative complications were associated with VTE (p &lt; 0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that a history of VTE, pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, postoperative complication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stage, and postoperative immobilization time were risk factors for developing symptomatic VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was 18.3 days, and the mortality rate was 6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of symptomatic DVT and PE were found to be not low in Asian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery patients compared with Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for VTE were a history of VTE, pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, postoperative complications, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stage, and postoperative immobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis should be strongly considered in patients with these characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Large prospective randomized controlled trials should be conducted to further evaluate the risk of VTE in Asian patients, and to determine the optimal prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
