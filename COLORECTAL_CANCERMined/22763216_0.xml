<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pro-inflammatory processes associated with the early postoperative state are known to contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> in patients with advanced diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether the wound healing response after an abdominal incision leads to increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity locally, contributing to peritoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Metastatic tumors</z:e> were initiated in C57bl/6J male mice (8wk of age) using a peritoneal injection model with syngeneic MC38 murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells; appropriate control mice also were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Injections were performed into the peritoneum in the right lower quadrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then observed the occurrence and rate of peritoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By making an incision into the abdominal wall of mice, an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was induced at the wound site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> initiated by the wound, in turn, increased the proliferation of mesothelial cells and increased inflammatory cell numbers locally, which contributed to an increase in parietal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the wound healing process increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the number of inflammatory cells in the peritoneum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MMP-9 in the modeled postoperative injury setting increased the number and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we conclude that wound-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> enhances pro-MMP-9 expression, which plays a key role in the growth and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346989" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
