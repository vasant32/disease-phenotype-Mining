<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been a large number of controlled clinical studies published in Chinese literature, yet no systematic searching and analysis has been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study summarizes the current evidence of controlled clinical studies of TCM for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the controlled clinical studies of TCM therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> published in Chinese in four main Chinese electronic databases from their inception to November 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We bibliometrically analyzed the included studies and assessed the reporting quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2964 reports (involving 253,434 cancer patients) including 2385 randomized controlled trials and 579 non-randomized controlled studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The top seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types treated were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophagus cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153392" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nasopharyngeal cancer</z:e> by both study numbers and case numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of studies (72%) applied TCM therapy combined with conventional treatment, whilst fewer (28%) applied only TCM therapy in the experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Herbal medicine was the most frequently applied TCM therapy (2677 studies, 90.32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported outcome was clinical symptom improvement (1667 studies, 56.24%) followed by biomarker indices (1270 studies, 42.85%), quality of life (1129 studies, 38.09%), chemo/radiotherapy induced side effects (1094 studies, 36.91%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (869 studies, 29.32%) and safety (547 studies, 18.45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Completeness and adequacy of reporting appeared to improve with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from controlled clinical studies of TCM therapies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment is substantial, and different therapies are applied either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reporting of controlled clinical studies should be improved based on the CONSORT and TREND Statements in future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies should address the most frequently used TCM therapy for common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and outcome measures should address survival, relapse/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and quality of life </plain></SENT>
