<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study was conducted at the Department of Pathology, University of Malaya Medical Centre to determine the expression of CD133 in 56 archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in comparison with adjacent benign colorectal epithelium by immunohistochemical staining for CD133 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD133 immunopositivity was determined as staining at the glandular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface or in the intraluminal debris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression was semiquantitated for (1) proportion of CD133 immunopositivity in the malignant or adjacent benign colorectal epithelium and (2) intensity of staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final score of CD133 immunopositivity was arbitrarily taken as proportion of CD133 immunopositivity multiplied by intensity of staining in both the malignant and adjacent benign colorectal epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD133 expression was observed in significantly increased frequency in 49 (87.5%) colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> compared with 15 (26.8%) of the adjacent benign colorectal epithelium (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In terms of immunopositivity score (proportion of CD133 immunopositivity multiplied by intensity of staining), colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had a mean arbitrary score of 8.5 which was significantly higher than the mean immunopositivity score of 0.5 of the adjacent benign colorectal epithelium (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the maximum immunopositivity score for the adjacent benign colorectal epithelium was 4, while 38 (67.9%) of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had scores &gt;4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows that CD133 is able to mark colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> but it is still unclear at this juncture whether CD133 is indeed a marker for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> "stem cells" </plain></SENT>
