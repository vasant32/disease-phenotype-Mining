<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this analysis was to determine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for treatment-related AEs in older bevacizumab recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients age ≥65 were identified from SEER-Medicare and categorized by mCRC diagnosis pre and post bevacizumab approval (2001-2003 vs. 2005-2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preexisting conditions known to increase bevacizumab-related AE risk were identified in the year before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with bevacizumab receipt were identified using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AEs and specific serious AEs were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for first AE were determined by competing risks regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 6821 patients, 3282 (48%) were diagnosed in 2005-2007 of whom 19% received first-line bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likelihood of bevacizumab receipt was lower in patients age ≥ 75 (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.47), nonwhite patients (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.81), patients with higher comorbidity index (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.62), and patients with preexisting cerebrovascular disease (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33-0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AE incidence rate was not increased among first-line bevacizumab recipients relative to first-line chemotherapy recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a competing risk regression adjusting for potential confounders, bevacizumab receipt (2005-2007) was not associated with an increased risk of first AE compared with chemotherapy alone (2001-2007) (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In an older mCRC population, bevacizumab receipt was less likely in older (age ≥ 75) nonwhite patients with preexisting cerebrovascular comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>First-line bevacizumab was not associated with increased AE incidence or risk of first AE compared with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
