<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine whether a high ambient temperature on the day of screening may decrease the performance of FITs in population-based screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed FITs for asymptomatic participants aged 50 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, the probability of a positive FIT and a detection rate of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were compared between low (&lt;10.0 °C) and high (≥25.0 °C) temperature groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FIT results for 8,316 participants were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean log(10) Hb concentration in the low temperature group was significantly higher than those in the high temperature group (0.36 vs. 0.25 ng/ml, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis showed that an increase in temperature of 1 °C reduced the probability of a positive FIT by 3.1 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we found no differences between the two groups in the FIT positive rate and detection rate of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, high ambient temperature was not a significant risk factor for either the positive FIT result or the detection of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Potential instability of fecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> at high ambient temperatures should be considered; however, its influence on performance of FIT may be attenuated by the short exposure time of fecal samples to high ambient temperature (i.e., rapid return system) </plain></SENT>
