<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some studies have shown its efficacy in combination with bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy, there are no data to support FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab as second-line chemotherapy in patients with this form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI and bevacizumab as second-line chemotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients were â‰¥20 years old, previously treated (except with irinotecan [<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11] and bevacizumab), with an Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and adequate organ function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five eligible patients received FOLFIRI with bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg given intravenously on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> therapy was administered every 2 weeks until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled between February 2008 and March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age was 62 (range 38-73) years, the male/female distribution was 20/5, 16 patients had performance status 0 and 9 had performance status 1, and the proportion of patients who were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> pretreated/untreated was 16/9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 32% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 17.0-50.4%), with 8 patients showing partial responses, 15 with stable disease, and 2 with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 11.6 months (95% CI: 6.9-16.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 21.4 months (95% CI: 12.0-30.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The grade 3/4 adverse events with treatment were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (64%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (16%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> (8%), and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The bevacizumab-related grade 3/4 adverse event was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which was observed in 12% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab regimen is an active, well-tolerated second-line chemotherapy treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
