<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated associations between polymorphic variation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Gc</z:e>-globulin (GC) and calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) and odds for metachronous colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> metabolite concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants from the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9907">Ursodeoxycholic Acid</z:chebi> (UDCA) and Wheat Bran Fiber (WBF) trials (n = 1,439) were analyzed using a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tagging approach, with a subset (n = 404) of UDCA trial participants for whom <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> metabolite concentrations were also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 25 GC and 35 CASR tagSNPs were evaluated using multiple statistical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Principal components analyses did not reveal gene-level associations between GC or CASR and colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; however, a significant gene-level association between GC and 25(OH)D concentrations (P &lt; 0.01) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the individual SNP level and following multiple comparisons adjustments, significant associations were observed between seven GC (rs7041, rs222035, rs842999, rs1155563, rs12512631, rs16846876, and rs1746825) polymorphisms and circulating measures of 25(OH)D (adjusted P &lt; 0.01) and CASR SNP rs1042636 and proximal colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (adjusted P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show a possible association between variation in CASR and odds of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> as well as the potential role of variation in GC with circulating 25(OH)D concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Impact: Additional research is warranted to determine the mechanism of GC genotype in influencing 25(OH)D concentrations and to further elucidate the role of CASR in colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
