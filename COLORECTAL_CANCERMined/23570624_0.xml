<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Although the importance of microsatellite instability (MSI) and mismatch repair genes (MMR) is strongly established in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, its significance has not been fully established in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of MSI and MMR proteins in WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: This study included 45 pediatric cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry of archival tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR melting analysis and fluorescence capillary electrophoresis (FCE) were performed to evaluate the MSI markers BAT25, BAT26, NR21, NR24, MONO27, penta D, and penta C in DNA extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Lower levels of MSI were observed in six cases (13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant correlations between MSI and some clinical prognostic factors such as stage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (42.2%) showed loss of protein expression of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, or MSH6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMR protein defects were correlated with size (P = .021), and stage (P = .019) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and survival rates (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly MSI was also correlated with the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (P = .046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results: This study showed that a small proportion of WT might be associated with the presence of MSI, as is the case with defects of DNA mismatch repair genes in the pathogenesis of WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was no concordance with the frequency of tissue expression of MMR proteins and MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that MMR genes may play an important role in the development of WT via different pathways </plain></SENT>
