<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is a clinically validated therapeutic strategy in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cediranib is an oral, highly potent VEGF signaling inhibitor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three VEGF receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This Phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cediranib (20 or 30 mg) in combination with mFOLFOX6 in Japanese patients with previously untreated metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the safety of the 20 mg dose was confirmed, a second cohort of patients was to be recruited to receive cediranib 30 mg + mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients received cediranib 20 mg + mFOLFOX6 and seven received cediranib 30 mg + mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient in the initial cediranib 20 mg cohort experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; grade 3 bilirubin increase); no DLTs were observed in the 30 mg cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most commonly reported adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, decreased appetite, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients in the 20 mg cohort and three in the 30 mg cohort experienced serious adverse events during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cediranib was generally well tolerated in this patient population with no evidence to suggest any significant pharmacokinetic interactions between cediranib and fluorouracil or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A preliminary evaluation showed that five of nine evaluable patients achieved a best response of partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cediranib (20 or 30 mg) in combination with mFOLFOX6 was considered tolerable according to the protocol-defined criteria, providing justification for the Phase II part of this study </plain></SENT>
