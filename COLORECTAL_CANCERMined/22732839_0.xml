<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the features and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> based on MSI including mismatch repair genes and expression of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1999 and 2008, a total of 2,649 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were analyzed using a prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mismatch repair defect (MMR-D) was defined as a loss of expression of more than one MMR protein and/or MSI-high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMR-proficiency (MMR-P) was defined as expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MMR proteins and microsatellite stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>)/MSI-low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Groups 1 (G1), 2 (G2), 3 (G3), and 4 (G4) were defined as MMR-D and p53-positive expression, MMR-D and p53-negative expression, MMR-P and p53-positive expression, MMR-P and p53-negative expression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-two (3.0 %), 181 (6.8 %), 1,368 (51.7 %), and 1,018 (38.5 %) patients were classified into groups 1-4, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between G1 and G2 showed differences in location (p &lt; 0.001), size (p = 0.030), node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.027), distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.009), and stage (p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison between G3 and G4 showed differences in location (p &lt; 0.001) and histology (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison between G2 and G4 showed differences in age (p &lt; 0.001), location (p &lt; 0.001), size (p = 0.006), histology (p &lt; 0.001), node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001), distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001), and stage (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, stage (p = 0.007) and histology (p &lt; 0.001) were associated with improved overall survival, and stage (p &lt; 0.001) was associated with disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the MSI and p53 subsets, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> showed different clinicopathologic features, but these subsets had no prognostic impact on overall and disease-free survival rate </plain></SENT>
