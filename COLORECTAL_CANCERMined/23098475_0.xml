<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterize the epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Saudi population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recorded in the Saudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry (SCR) between January 2001 and December 2006 amongst Saudi citizens in KSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from the database of the SCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics was performed using SPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 4,201 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were registered in the SCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> increased between 2001 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 58 years; most patients were above 45 years of age (n=3322; 79.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis, 977 patients (23.0%) presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> and 1,018 (24.0%) had distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent pathological variant was <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (73%), with grade 2 (moderately differentiated) being the most common grade among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variants (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> grades, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly higher among patients &gt;45 years (P=0.004), who presented with more advanced disease (stages III and IV) (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on logistic regression, age &gt;45 years was associated with advanced regional presentation (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> grade was associated with advanced regional presentation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was an increase in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 2001 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The age at the time of diagnosis was low when compared with reports from developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A nationwide approach is needed to encourage and illustrate the importance of screening programs </plain></SENT>
