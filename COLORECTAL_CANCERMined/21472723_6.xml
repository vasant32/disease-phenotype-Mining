<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Medicare population has documented racial/ethnic disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening, but it is unknown whether these disparities differ across geographic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among Medicare enrollees within 8 US states, we ascertained up-to-date <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening on December 31, 2003 (fecal occult blood testing in the prior year or sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in the prior 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models tested for regional variation in up-to-date status among white versus different nonwhite populations (blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders [APIs], Hispanics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We estimated regression-adjusted region-specific prevalence of up-to-date status by race/ethnicity and compared adjusted white versus nonwhite up-to-date prevalence across regions by using generalized least squares regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: White versus nonwhite up-to-date status varied significantly across regions for blacks (P = .01) and APIs (P &lt; .001) but not Hispanics (P = .62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas the white versus black differences in proportion up-to-date were greatest in Atlanta (Georgia), rural Georgia, and the San Francisco Bay Area of California (range, 10%-16% differences, blacks&lt;whites); there were no significant white versus black differences in Connecticut, Seattle (Washington) or Iowa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas APIs had significantly lower up-to-date prevalence than whites in Michigan and the California regions of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Jose (range, 4%-15% differences, APIs&lt;whites), APIs in Hawaii had higher up-to-date status than whites (52% vs 38% P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>White versus Hispanic differences were substantial but homogeneous across regions (range, 8%-16% differences, Hispanics&lt;whites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to nonwhites, there was little geographic variation in up-to-date status among whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant geographic variation in up-to-date status among black and API Medicare enrollees is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> racial/ethnic disparities for these groups across US regions </plain></SENT>
