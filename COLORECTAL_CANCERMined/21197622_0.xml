<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It demonstrated an efficacy in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The standard recommendation of administration is the 90-, 60-, and 30-min infusion sequence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated in this study the possibility of reducing infusion time to 10 min for bevacizumab given at 5 or 7.5 mg/kg in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who received bevacizumab for MCRC were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: Group A (bevacizumab was given in the 90-, 60-, and 30-min infusion sequence) and group B (bevacizumab was given over 10 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' medical records were used to identify any hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) possibly related to bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 38 patients in group A and 43 in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group A, 459 doses of bevacizumab were given (286 doses at 5 mg/kg and 173 doses at 7.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No HSR occurred in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group B, 527 doses of bevacizumab were given (335 doses at 5 mg/kg and 192 doses at 7.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only two events of HSR grade 2 were reported in the 7.5 mg/kg infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both of them were easily resolved with symptomatic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab 5 or 7.5 mg/kg in MCRC can be infused safely over 10 min </plain></SENT>
