<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Community-based health education is helpful for health planners to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, yet relatively few studies tapped the temporal pattern of intervention effectiveness in a multiyear <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> education program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using data from a two-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> community education, this study was aimed at exploring whether the health education intervention effectiveness differs between first-year and the second-year participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A two-year health education intervention was carried out in four communities in Shanghai, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The health education focused on raising awareness about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the principles of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening, and instruction about use of the FOBT kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local community health service centers conducted the lectures once a month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult residents were invited to attend these lectures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the first year and the second year, structured in-person interviews were conducted for the residents who attended the lectures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 205 enrollees who completed the first-year interviews and 836 enrollees who completed the second- year interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to compare the attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of enrollees in years 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Of the 1041 respondents, 24.5% had received FOBT during the program period, while 12% had received colonoscopy check, both substantially higher than the background screening rate in Shanghai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Respondents in year 2 were less willing to take FOBT than those in year 1 (O.R.=0.618, p&lt;0.01), but there was no significant difference in terms of willingness to take colonoscopy after adjustment for covariates in logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression also showed that respondents in year 2 were significantly less likely to take FOBT than those in year 1 (O.R. = 0.263, p&lt;0.01) and a similar tendency was noted for colonoscopy (O.R.=0.600, p=0.074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rate after the health education compared favorably with the background screening rate, yet the decline in screening rate in year 2 indicates that further study is needed to understand the determinants of intervention effectiveness </plain></SENT>
