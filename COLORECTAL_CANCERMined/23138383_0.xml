<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) colonography cost assumptions so far ranged from &lt;euro&gt;346 to &lt;euro&gt;594 per procedure, based on clinical CT reimbursement rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to estimate the costs in a screening situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected within an invitational population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening trial (n = 2,920, age 50-75 years) with a dedicated CT-screening setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unit costs were calculated per action, per invitee and per participant (depending on adherence) and per individual with detected advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were performed, and alternative scenarios were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the invitees, 47.2 % were reminded, 38.8 % scheduled for an intake, 37.2 % scheduled for CT colonography, 33.6 % underwent CT colonography and 1.1 % needed a re-examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesions ≥10 mm were detected in 2.9 % of the invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Invitation costs were &lt;euro&gt;5.57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Costs per CT colonography (intake to results) were &lt;euro&gt;144.00 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extra costs of communication of positive results were &lt;euro&gt;9.00 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Average costs of invitational-based CT colonography screening were &lt;euro&gt;56.97 per invitee, &lt;euro&gt;169.40 per participant and &lt;euro&gt;2,772.51 per individual with detected advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dutch costs of CT-screening were substantially lower than the cost assumptions that were used in published cost-effectiveness analyses on CT colonography screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that previous cost-effectiveness analyses should be updated, at least for the Dutch situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS : • CT colonography screening costs have historically been based on (local) clinical reimbursement rates • Estimates ranged from &lt;euro&gt;346-&lt;euro&gt;594, based on abdominal and/or pelvic computed tomography • Average costs per participant within an invitational population-based screening program: &lt;euro&gt;169.40 • Average CT colonography costs per individual with detected advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>: &lt;euro&gt;2,772.51 • Previous cost-effectiveness analyses should probably be updated </plain></SENT>
