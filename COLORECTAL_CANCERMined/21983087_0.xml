<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we use quantitative proteomics to investigate lamin A regulated changes in the cytoskeleton that might underpin increased cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using siRNA knockdown of lamin A in a model cell line (SW480/lamA) we confirm that the presence of lamin A promotes cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an enhanced technique to prepare cytoskeleton fractions in combination with 2D DiGE we were able to accurately and reproducibly detect changes in the representation of protein species within the cytoskeleton as low as 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total 64 protein spots displayed either increased or decreased representation within the cytoskeleton of SW480/lamA cells compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these the identities of 29 spots were determined by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A majority were multiple forms of three classes of proteins, including components of the actin and IF cytoskeletons, protein chaperones and translation initiation and elongation factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular our data reveal that the representation of tissue transglutaminase 2, which is known to modify elements of the cytoskeleton and is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e>, was highly over-represented in the cytoskeleton fraction of SW480/lamA cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data are consistent with changed protein cross-linking and folding that favours the formation of dynamic actin filaments over stress fibres accounting for the altered cell motility properties in SW480/lamA cells </plain></SENT>
