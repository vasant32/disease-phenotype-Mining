<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data (endoscopy, pathology, demography) of patients who received surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years after colonoscopic polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1,794 patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years after colonoscopic polypectomy, 14 suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 2.67 years and the incidence density of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> was 2.9 cases per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> were found in patients in whom <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> had been incompletely removed by endoscopic therapy, 36% were missed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and 14% were new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;60 years (OR 2.97, 95% CI 2.31-3.82) was significantly associated with interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> on the surveillance colonoscopy as were advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.62), the presence of villous (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03-1.85) and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07-2.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years after polypectomy, the incidence density of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> was 2.9 cases per 1,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> originated from incomplete resection of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and missed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, which can be prevented by improving endoscopic techniques and selecting an appropriate follow-up time interval </plain></SENT>
