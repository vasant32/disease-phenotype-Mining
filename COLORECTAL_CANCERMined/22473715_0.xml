<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B7-H3 is an immunoregulatory protein shown to be overexpressed in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> forms, often associated with more advanced disease and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to examine whether B7-H3 could be a potential prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded samples from 277 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were immunostained with anti-B7-H3 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B7-H3 was expressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell cytoplasm and cell membrane in 62% and 46% of the samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, B7-H3 was expressed in the nucleus in 30% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nuclear localization was confirmed by Western immunoblotting of subcellular fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, nuclear B7-H3 expression was independently and significantly associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free, disease-specific and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B7-H3 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated vasculature and fibroblasts was observed in the majority of samples, and endothelial B7-H3 expression was also significantly associated with poor outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients, the only significant association was between fibroblast B7-H3 expression and shorter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Few significant associations to clinicopathological parameters were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that nuclear B7-H3 might be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> progression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and suggest that nuclear B7-H3 could become a useful prognostic marker in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
