<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intermittent pneumatic compression (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) devices have been widely used for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prophylaxis in laparoscopic colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, periodic compression using an <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> device may inject augmented boluses of cool blood from the lower limbs into the central circulation repetitively, thereby causing a reduction in core temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors therefore conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study to compare the effects of intraoperative <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> on core temperature in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For this study, 56 patients ages 18-60 years and scheduled to undergo laparoscopic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive either no <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> (control group) or calf-thigh-length <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> in both legs using the SCD Express (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">Anesthetic</z:chebi>, thermal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> management were standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal temperature, as an indicator of core temperature, was measured at 15-min intervals for 2 h after induction of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 47 subjects (23 control and 24 IPC subjects) were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The core temperature drop in the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> group was significantly greater than in the control group, starting from 45 min after induction of anesthesia (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, the total temperature drop during the 2-h study period was significantly greater in the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> group (1.2 ± 0.3 °C) than in the control group (0.9 ± 0.3 °C) (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because intraoperative application of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> carries an increased risk of a core temperature drop, appropriate temperature monitoring and active thermal management are required for surgical patients receiving <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
