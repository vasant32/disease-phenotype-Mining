<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen mice were equally divided into <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-5-FU-MAMS group(n=6), 5-FU-MAMS group(n=6), and 5-FU group(n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was exposed in the magnetic field of 3000 GS for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three types of 5-FU were injected through the vena caudalis at the dose of 8 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes later, the animals were immediately sacreficed after blood draw from the fossa orbitalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of 5-FU in different organs including liver, lung, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue were determined by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-FU concentrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue, liver, lung, and blood were(73.3±3.2), (22.1±2.7), (26.3±2.8), and(1.6±0.6) mg/L in the <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-5-FU-MAMS group, and were(55.9±5.4), (46.3±8.2), (39.4±5.4), and(1.7±0.4) mg/L in the 5-FU-MAMS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-FU concentration in colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was higher in the <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-5-FU-MAMS group than that in the 5-FU-MAMS group(P&lt;0.01), while the concentration was lower in the liver and the lung than that in the 5-FU-MAMS group(<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant difference of 5-FU concentration in the blood sample(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-5-FU-MAMS and 5-FU-MAMS show significant magnetic targeting to the colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and passive target capacity of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-5-FU-MAMS to liver and the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> modification can decrease passive target capacity and the active target capacity can be enhanced, which efficiently reduces the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents to important organs, and therefore provides a new initiative targeting chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
