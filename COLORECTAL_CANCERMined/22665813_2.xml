<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk and associated risk factors for gastrointestinal subsequent malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (SMNs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Cancer</z:e> Survivor Study, a multicenter study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> survivors diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 14 358 survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosed when they were younger than 21 years of age who survived for 5 or more years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for gastrointestinal SMNs were calculated by using age-specific population data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression models identified associations between risk factors and gastrointestinal SMN development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At median follow-up of 22.8 years (range, 5.5 to 30.2 years), 45 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk for gastrointestinal SMNs was 4.6-fold higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> survivors than in the general population (95% CI, 3.4 to 6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SIR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was 4.2 (CI, 2.8 to 6.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest risk for gastrointestinal SMNs was associated with abdominal radiation (SIR, 11.2 [CI, 7.6 to 16.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, survivors not exposed to radiation had a significantly increased risk (SIR, 2.4 [CI, 1.4 to 3.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition to abdominal radiation, high-dose procarbazine (relative risk, 3.2 [CI, 1.1 to 9.4]) and <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> drugs (relative risk, 7.6 [CI, 2.3 to 25.5]) independently increased the risk for gastrointestinal SMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: This cohort has not yet attained an age at which risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> is greatest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood cancer</z:e> survivors, particularly those exposed to abdominal radiation, are at increased risk for gastrointestinal SMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that surveillance of at-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> survivors should begin at a younger age than that recommended for the general population </plain></SENT>
