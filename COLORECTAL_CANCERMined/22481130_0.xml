<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Insufficient evidence on the net benefits and harms of genomic tests in real-world settings is a translational barrier for genomic medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding stakeholders' assessment of the current evidence base for clinical practice and coverage decisions should be a critical step in influencing research, policy, and practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two stakeholders participated in a workshop exploring the evidence of genomic tests for clinical and coverage decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stakeholders completed a survey prior to and during the meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also discussed if they would recommend for or against current clinical use of each test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the level of confidence in the clinical validity and clinical utility of each test varied, although the group expressed greater confidence for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> testing than for Oncotype DX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following the discussion, survey results reflected even less confidence for Oncotype DX, intermediate levels of confidence for [corrected] epidermal growth factor receptor mutation testing and stable levels of confidence [corrected] for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of stakeholders would consider clinical use for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three tests, but under the conditions of additional research or a shared clinical decision-making approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stakeholder engagement in unbiased settings is necessary to understand various perspectives about evidentiary thresholds in genomic medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants recommended the use of various methods for evidence generation and synthesis </plain></SENT>
