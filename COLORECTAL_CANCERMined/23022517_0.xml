<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cationized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> (CPAA) with increasing charge densities was prepared by radical polymerization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> and different mol% ratios of N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48077">acryloyl</z:chebi>, N'-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi>) diaminoethane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NIR fluorophore derivative of IR-783, IR-783-S-Ph-COOH, was attached to the CPAA to give CPAA-783 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After selecting the optimal IR-783-S-Ph-COOH ratio that avoids quenching, the preferential binding of the polymer was tested in SW-620, SW-480, HT-29, and LS-174T <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimal polymeric product was tested in situ in gut sac preparations of the dimethylhydrazine induced rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To increase the detection capabilities of CPAA-783, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> EPPT1, that targets the cell transmembrane underglycosylated MUC-1 (uMUC-1), was conjugated to the polymer to obtain CPAA-783-EPPT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dually labeled modified polymer was tested in HT-29 and LS-174T cells (over expressing uMUC-1), followed by an examination in an orthotopic mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CPAA-783 preferentially bound to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, depending on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best binding occurred when the fraction of the cationic monomer was 100 mol%, labeled with 0.75 mol% of IR-783-S-Ph-COOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase in the recognition of the dually labeled polymeric product, CPAA-783-EPPT1, towards HT-29 and LS-174T cells occurred in the lowest EPPT1molar ratio (0.63 mol%) only, probably due to quenching phenomena and steric hindrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar observation was obtained in the orthotopic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that fluorescently tagged CPAA can be used for the detection of malignant tissues in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> instillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dually targeted CPAA with EPPT1is feasible, but requires further optimization </plain></SENT>
