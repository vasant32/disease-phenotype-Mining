<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Routine use of nasogastric tubes (NGT) after abdominal operations is intended to hasten the return of bowel function, diminish the risk of anastomotic leakage and prevent pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to prospectively assess the tolerability and the safety of the non use of NGT after elective colorectal open operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 2009 and December 2010, 110 consecutive patients underwent colo-rectal elective open surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> without nasogastric decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, the pulmonary complications, the return of bowel function the deep wound breakdown (fascial dehiscence) and the anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 15 patients (13,6%) reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> immediately after surgery and 9 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> were observed (8%), requiring the insertion of the NGT (nasogastric tube) in 5 (4,5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 105 patients (96,3%) were NGT free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No deep wound dehiscence was observed and only one real <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic dehiscence occurred in 4 patients (3,6%) and a second surgical procedure was needed in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The return of bowel function, except in the last four patients, occurred in 3,8 days average (range 2-7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We confirm the uselessness of the NGT in the framework of fast track program adopted in elective open colo-rectal surgery </plain></SENT>
