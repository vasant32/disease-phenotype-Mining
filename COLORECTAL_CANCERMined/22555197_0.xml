<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We investigated the efficacy and safety of the combination of irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) and S-1 (IRIS regimen) as a first-line treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the association between UGT1A1 and CYP2A6 polymorphisms and clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients received <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 (225 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and S-1 (80 mg/m(2)) on days 1-14 every 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of the UGT1A1 (*6 and *28) and CYP2A6(*4, *7, *9, and *10) polymorphisms with toxicities and efficacy were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 66.7% (95% CI 48.7-84.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression was 7.6 months (95% CI 5.8-9.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3/4 hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (53.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (16.7%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies of UGT1A1*6 and *28 were 15.5 and 10.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of CYP2A6*4, *7, *9, and *10 were 15.5, 8.6, 29.3, and 3.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stratification of patients according to the number of UGT1A1*28 and *6 alleles showed a significant correlation between the number of defective alleles and the incidence of grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IRIS is a promising first-line regimen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> may be associated with interindividual variations in UGT1A1 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
