<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may be induced by a range of different causes, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As they form part of the earliest response to such insults, they have potential for early identification of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In people, APP levels have been shown to correlate both with the extent of disease and also the prognosis in several forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, including prostate, oesophageal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As such, they can be used as prognostic and monitoring tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, similar studies in veterinary patients have been limited, largely retrospective in nature and many are non-specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate a panel of four APPs in dogs with naturally occurring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334664" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mast cell tumours</z:e> (MCTs) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> to identify in the first instance whether increased levels of individual APPs, or identifiable combinations of APPs, was linked with the presence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients with MCTs, C-reactive protein (CRP) and α-1 acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> levels increased, with a concurrent drop in serum amyloid A levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> patients, CRP, α-1 acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and haptoglobin were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumour</z:e> types in dogs may be associated with specific changes in APP profiles </plain></SENT>
