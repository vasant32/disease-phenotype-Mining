<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to assess the most prognostic and reproducible scoring systems for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> budding on pancytokeratin-stained whole tissue sections from 105 well-characterized stage II patients was scored by 3 observers using 7 methods: Hase, Nakamura, Ueno, Wang (conventional and rapid method), densest high-power field, and 10 densest high-power fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predictive value for clinicopathologic features, the prognostic significance, and interobserver variability of each scoring method was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pancytokeratin staining allowed accurate evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> buds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for 3 observers was excellent for densest high-power field (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.83) and 10 densest high-power fields (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agreement was moderate to substantial for the conventional Wang method (κ = 0.46-0.62) and moderate for the rapid method (κ = 0.46-0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For Nakamura, moderate agreement (κ = 0.41-0.52) was reached, whereas concordance was fair to moderate for Ueno (κ = 0.39-0.56) and Hase (κ = 0.29-0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Hase, Ueno, densest high-power field, and 10 densest high-power field methods identified a significant association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> border configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding as evaluated in densest high-power field and 10 densest high-power fields had significant prognostic effects on patient survival (P &lt; .01), with high prognostic accuracy over the full 10-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Scoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> buds in 10 densest high-power fields is a promising method to identify stage II patients at high risk for recurrence in daily diagnostics; it is highly reproducible, accounts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and has a strong predictive value for adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
