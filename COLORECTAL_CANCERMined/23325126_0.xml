<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relevant articles were reviewed from the published literature using the Medline database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The search was performed using the keywords "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>", "liver-first", "reverse strategy", "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>", "liver resection" and "hepatectomy" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There have been four retrospective studies that have reported the outcomes of patients with synchronous CRLM following the reverse strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of patients included ranged from 16 to 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One study included patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the studies defined resectability for the CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the morbidity and mortality rates were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate ranged from 25 to 70 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One study did not report survival data, and the overall 5 year survival ranged from 31 to 41 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The "liver-first" approach may be beneficial to a selected group of patients with synchronous CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient selection is likely to be determined by their response to down-staging chemotherapy with or without biological agents </plain></SENT>
