<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, a large-scale screening of the complete miRNA mimics library demonstrated that hsa-miR-15a-3p had a pro-apoptotic role in the following human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells: HeLa, AsPc-1, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231, KB3, ME180, HCT-116 and A549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MiR-15a-3p is a novel member of the pro-apoptotic miRNA cluster, miR-15a/16, which was found to activate Caspase-3/7 and to cause viability loss in B/CMBA.Ov cells during preliminary screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent microarrays and bioinformatics analyses identified the following four anti-apoptotic genes: bcl2l1, naip5, fgfr2 and mybl2 as possible targets for the mmu-miR-15a-3p in B/CMBA.Ov cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies confirmed the pro-apoptotic role of hsa-miR-15a-3p in human cells by its ability to activate Caspase-3/7, to reduce cell viability and to inhibit the expression of bcl2l1 (bcl-xL) in HeLa and AsPc-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MiR-15-3p was also found to reduce viability in HEK293, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231, KB3, ME180, HCT-116 and A549 cell lines and, therefore, may be considered for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> modulating therapies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> associated with high Bcl-xL expression (cervical, pancreatic, breast, lung and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The capability of hsa-miR-15a-3p to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in these <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> may be dependent on the levels of Bcl-xL expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of endogenous inhibitors of bcl-xL and other anti-apoptotic genes such as hsa-miR-15a-3p may provide improved options for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-modulating therapies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment compared with the use of artificial antisense oligonucleotides </plain></SENT>
