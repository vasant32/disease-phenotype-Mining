<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the important role of the most abundant liver-specific microRNA, miR-122, in hepatic function and liver pathology, here we investigated the potential role and mechanism of miR-122 in regulating HBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that miR-122 expression in liver was significantly down-regulated in patients with HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> compared with healthy controls, and the miR-122 levels were negatively correlated with intrahepatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load and hepatic necroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of endogenous miR-122 by its antisense inhibitor led to enhanced HBV replication, whereas overexpression of miR-122 by transfection of mimic or its expression vector inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We next identified cyclin G(1) as an miR-122 target from multiple candidate target genes that are involved in the regulation of HBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression and knockdown studies both showed that cyclin G(1) regulated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication in HBV transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed that cyclin G(1) expression was up-regulated in HBV-infected patients, and cyclin G(1) levels were inversely associated with miR-122 expression in liver tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using coimmunoprecipitation, a luciferase reporter system, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we further demonstrated that cyclin G(1) specifically interacted with p53, and this interaction blocked the specific binding of p53 to HBV enhancer elements and simultaneously abrogated p53-mediated inhibition of HBV transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that miR-122 suppressed HBV replication in p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> cells but not in null isogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: miR-122 down-regulates its target cyclin G(1) , and thus interrupts the interaction between cyclin G(1) and p53 and abrogates p53-mediated inhibition of HBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our work shows that miR-122 down-regulation induced by HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> can impact HBV replication and possibly contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> persistence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
