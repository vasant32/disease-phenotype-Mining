<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carriers of germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes have high risks of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether these risks depend on the parent-of-origin of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 422 subjects, including 89 MMR gene mutation carriers, from 17 population-based families who were each recruited via a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> case diagnosed before age 45 years and found to carry a MMR gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The POE hazard ratio (HR(POE)), defined to be the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence for carriers with maternally derived mutations divided by the corresponding paternal incidence, was estimated using a novel application of modified segregation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HR(POE) (95% confidence interval) was estimated to be 3.2 (1.1-9.8) for males (P = 0.03) and 0.8 (0.2-2.8) for females (P = 0.5) and the corresponding cumulative risks to age 80 years were 88% (54%-100%) for male carriers with maternally derived mutations and 38-48% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If confirmed by larger studies, these results will have important implications for the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and for the clinical management of MMR gene mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
