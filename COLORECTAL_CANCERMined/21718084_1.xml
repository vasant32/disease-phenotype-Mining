<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> aged over 70 years were identified from a computer database and their clinical variables were analyzed by both univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent resective surgery, 79% radical and 21% palliative resection, and postoperative mortality was 6% being associated with the presence of postoperative complications, especially anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 5-year survival was 38%, the median survival 35 months, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific 5-year survival 48% and this did not differ significantly between the age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate after radical surgery was 30%, being 12, 22, 56, and 100% in Dukes classes A, B, C, and D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates indicated that gender, Dukes staging, grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, number of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, venous invasion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> were significant predictors of survival, but in the Cox regression model, only venous invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> were independent prognostic factors of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low mortality and acceptable survival can be achieved in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458156" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent cancer</z:e> are independent predictors of survival </plain></SENT>
