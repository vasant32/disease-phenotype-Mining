<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> have a high risk of developing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at a young age, due to inherited mutations in mismatch repair genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether modifiable lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake, increase this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from the GeoLynch cohort study, a prospective analysis of 386 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, we calculated hazard ratios for the association between smoking and alcohol intake and development of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used robust variance estimates in the calculation of 95% confidence intervals to account for dependency within families and adjusted for confounding by age, sex, smoking (in the analyses of alcohol intake), number of colonoscopies during the follow-up, colonic resection, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 10 months, 58 subjects developed a histologically confirmed colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for current smokers was 6.13 (95% confidence interval, 2.84-13.22) and for former smokers was 3.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-6.16) compared with never smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among ever smokers, a higher number of pack-years was associated with an increased risk for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (P for trend = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend of alcohol intake increasing the risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, although this was not statistically significant; the hazard ratio for the highest tertile of intake (median, 22 g/day) vs the lowest tertile (median, 0.4 g/day) was 1.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-3.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, current smokers have an increased risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Former smokers have a lower risk than current smokers, but greater risk than never smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> should be encouraged to avoid smoking </plain></SENT>
