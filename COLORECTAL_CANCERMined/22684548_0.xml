<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: With a theoretical link between stent insertion and increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> seeding, there is concern about long-term survival after the use of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) as a "bridge to surgery" in the treatment of left-sided obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cohort study aims to determine if preoperative stenting adversely affects long-term survival by comparing a group of patients having preoperative stenting (group A) with a group of patients having elective surgery (group B) in a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study is retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other group characteristics were compared with Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From November 1998 to November 2008, 15 patients had preoperative SEMS and were entered in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This represented 11.5 % of a total of 130 patients undergoing SEMS insertion in the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group B included 88 consecutive patients undergoing elective left-sided colonic resection for Dukes' B and C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> excluding mid and low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumours</z:e> between January 2003 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate for groups A and B was 6.7 % (one patient) and 5.7 % (five patients), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 60 % and 58 %, respectively, with a p value of 0.96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our own practice, patients undergoing SEMS as a "bridge to surgery" have the same long-term survival with those undergoing elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding needs to be confirmed in larger scale studies </plain></SENT>
