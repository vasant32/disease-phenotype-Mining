<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine recommended delays for treatment once there is well-founded clinical suspicion in care processes for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, taking into account resources and the psychological well-being of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A qualitative study among professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted in two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Firstly, during 4 sessions (N=19) we conducted a revision of the care processes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and fixed desirable times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, through a modification of the Delphi technique (N=49), the proposed times for each care process were validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delphi response rates of 69% and 58% for colorectal and breast processes respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recommended time in the case of non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was 5 to 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was invasive and nuclear medicine was used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sentinel node</z:e> study or axillary clearance 5 to 7 weeks were recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the colon</z:e> and rectum 7 to 13 weeks were considered necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> treatment should be started before six weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> up to three months could be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An interdisciplinary review of care processes relying on professionals is useful for establishing realistic quality standards </plain></SENT>
