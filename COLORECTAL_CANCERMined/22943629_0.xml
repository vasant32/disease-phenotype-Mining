<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> is a major adverse effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (OXL) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas neurophysiologic study is commonly used to assess the occurrence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathies</z:hpo>, ultrasound (US) analysis of the peripheral nerves, an emerging technique in the study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral nerve diseases</z:e>, has never been used in chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (four women; 11 men; mean age, 60.1 ± 10.6 years; median, 62; range, 37-75) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with OXL-based treatment have been clinically and neurophysiologically evaluated before and after OXL therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of chemotherapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent also nerve US study at four limbs, and the findings correlated with clinical and neurophysiologic measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical and neurophysiological evaluation showed that 13 of 15 (86.7%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003390'>sensory axonal neuropathy</z:hpo>, 10 of whom severe (two or more sensory nerve action potential amplitude absent and the other amplitudes decreased of ≥50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nerve US did not reveal decreased cross-sectional area (CSA), a reported finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead increased CSA at entrapment sites (median nerve at wrist and ulnar nerve at elbow) was found in 09/15 (60%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003390'>Sensory axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> is a very common complication of OXL therapy, affecting almost 90% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>US findings of enlargement of median and ulnar nerves, mostly at entrapment sites, in patients with no history or symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e> at recruitment, and no neurophysiologic evidence of entrapment, may be expression of increased, OXL-induced, nerve susceptibility to mechanical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An ongoing prospective study will help clarify these findings </plain></SENT>
