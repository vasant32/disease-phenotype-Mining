<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significantly decreased cell viability of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> HT29 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 53.67±2.99 μM for 24-h treatment was found. γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5768">Humulene</z:chebi> induced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was confirmed by morphological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) and flow cytometric analysis also showed that γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5768">humulene</z:chebi> significantly promoted the sub-G1 phase (an apoptotic population) in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colorimetric assays indicated that pretreatment with a specific inhibitor of caspase-8 (Z-IETD-FMK) significantly reduced activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in examined HT29 cells. γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5768">Humulene</z:chebi> stimulated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor 5 (DR5), DR4, Fas-associated protein with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain (FADD), the cleavage of caspase-8 and cleavage caspase-3, but reduced the protein levels of cellular Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-domain-like IL-1ß-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5768">humulene</z:chebi>-triggered cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly attenuated by DR5 siRNA and the caspase-8 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we suggest that γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5768">humulene</z:chebi> induced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in HT29 cells through a DR5-mediated caspase-8 and -3-dependent signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this agent might be useful for developing new therapeutic regimens for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the future </plain></SENT>
