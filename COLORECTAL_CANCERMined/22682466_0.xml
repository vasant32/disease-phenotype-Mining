<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated the potential effect of increased walking and cycling in urban England and Wales on costs to the National Health Service (NHS) for seven diseases--namely, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>--that are associated with physical inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 20 years, reductions in the prevalences of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, cerebrovascular disease, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> because of increased physical activity would lead to savings of roughly UKÂ£17 billion (in 2010 prices) for the NHS, after adjustment for an increased risk of road traffic injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further costs would be averted after 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses show that results are invariably positive but sensitive to assumptions about time lag between the increase in active travel and changes in health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing the amount of walking and cycling in urban settings could reduce costs to the NHS, permitting decreased government expenditure on health or releasing resources to fund additional health care </plain></SENT>
