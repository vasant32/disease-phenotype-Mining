<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic complications after radiofrequency ablation can usually be treated conservatively, but such complications can be massive and fatal in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report the rare case of delayed massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo> caused by the rupture of a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm after lung radiofrequency ablation that was treated using transcatheter coil embolization followed by a left lower lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 75-year-old woman underwent radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of a metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> in the left lower lobe arising from a colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> located close to a branch of the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six hours later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic shock occurred as a result of a ruptured pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm and radiofrequency ablation-induced damage to the interlobular pleura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After transcatheter coil embolization of the pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, she recovered from a state of shock and a left lower lobectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological findings revealed the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> cells in the ablated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful, and no evidence of recurrence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> was seen at 1 year after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo> secondary to the rupture of a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm after lung radiofrequency ablation is a rare complication, it should be recognized as a serious potential complication of lung radiofrequency ablation for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> located close to the pulmonary artery branch </plain></SENT>
