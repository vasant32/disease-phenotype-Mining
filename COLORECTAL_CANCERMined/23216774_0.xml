<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Recent advancements in the management of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> have resulted in an improvement in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Novel biomarkers such as KRAS, and their mutations potentially predict the response of biological therapies such as cetuximab (Erbitux) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper evaluates the use of cetuximab in the first-line management of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed of publications within the past 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following key words, singly or in combination, were used: KRAS, cetuximab, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen prospective studies reviewed the clinical application of cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven studies included sub-group analysis of KRAS mutational status, with only one study performed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Until the MRC COIN trial, the evidence consistently demonstrated cetuximab significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival and surgical resection rates, especially in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the MRC COIN trial found cetuximab had no additional benefit when combined with standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The literature does not support the routine use of cetuximab as the standard first-line treatment of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, rather highlighting the need for the optimization of treatment on an individual basis, especially depending on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> KRAS status </plain></SENT>
