<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the potential of one such promoter element, p21 (WAF1), to drive expression of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> transporter (NAT) gene, which conveys sensitivity to radioiodinated meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An expression vector containing NAT under the control of the radiation-inducible WAF1 promoter (pWAF/NAT) was produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The non-NAT expressing cell lines UVW (<z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo>) and HCT116 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) were transfected with this construct to assess radiation-controlled WAF1 activation of the NAT gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection of UVW and HCT cells with pWAF/NAT conferred upon them the ability to accumulate [I]MIBG, which led to increased sensitivity to the radiopharmaceutical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of transfected cells with Î³ radiation or the radiopharmaceuticals [I]MIBG or [I]MIBG induced dose- and time-dependent increases in subsequent [I]MIBG uptake and led to enhanced efficacy of [I]MIBG-mediated cell kill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene therapy using WAF1-driven expression of NAT has the potential to expand the use of this therapeutic modality to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that lack a radio-targetable feature </plain></SENT>
