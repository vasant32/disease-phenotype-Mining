<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the discovery of a new MSI marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR, T20 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29075">mononucleotide</z:chebi> repeat) of the metallothionein 1X gene (MT1XT20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 340 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> using three multiplexed polymerase chain reactions amplifying BAT25, BAT26, TGFBR2, MybT22, BAT40, MT1XT20, NR21, NR24, CAT25, D2S123, D5S346, D17S250, D18S58, CSF1PO, D7S820, and D18S51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fragments length was evaluated by automated capillary electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the NCI/ICG-HNPCC criteria for MSI classification, 40 CRCs were found to be MSI-high (11.8%), 46 (13.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> were MSI-low, and 254 CRCs (74.7%) were stable (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MT1XT20 showed very high sensitivity (97.3%) comparable to BAT26 (97.5%) and CAT25 (97.1%) and the best specificity (100%) as well as MybT22 and CAT25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, MT1XT20 instability was detected in 36 out of 37 cases (97.3%) of MSI-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, whereas no MT1XT20 alterations were observed in 254 MSS or in 46 MSI-low cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, BAT40 was found to be unstable in 8/46 MSI-low cases, BAT25 in 6/46, BAT26 4/46, NR21 1/46, and NR24 in 1/45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MT1XT20 represents a sensitive and specific marker for MSI testing and could be included in a complete set of MSI markers for the confident identification of familial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> dMMR patients in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
