<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the Wnt signaling pathway in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (SSA) of the colorectum remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using 2 antibodies targeting different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (C-terminus and N-terminus), β-catenin expression in 35 SSAs and 30 right-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (RHPs) was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples of 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa, 32 left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath>, 27 traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (TSAs), and 40 traditional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (TAs) were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC) and mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCC), key regulators of β-catenin, was also examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the C-terminus antibody, no nuclear staining of β-catenin was observed in any SSAs or RHPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, with the N-terminus antibody, accumulation of β-catenin was seen in 40.0% of SSAs and 33.3% of RHPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average immunoreactivity score of APC in SSAs (67.0 ± 21.6) and RHPs (69.2 ± 24.4) was significantly higher than that in TAs (22.0 ± 18.0) and TSAs (49.5 ± 23.1; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MCC was more frequently lost in right-sided-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> such as SSA and RHP than in left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> such as left-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath>, TSA, and TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Wnt signaling is activated in SSA and its possible precursor lesion RHP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study also implied that the specific molecular form of β-catenin may participate in the Wnt signaling activation of right-sided serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, loss of MCC expression but not APC may contribute to the early activation of Wnt signaling in right-sided serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
