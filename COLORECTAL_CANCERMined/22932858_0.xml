<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Proctectomy after hepatectomy, or the reverse approach, is an alternative to traditional sequencing for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> with asymptomatic colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the surgical morbidity of proctectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after previous liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-institution colorectal database was queried for patients treated with proctectomy after previous hepatectomy from 2003 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse-approach patients (n = 31) were matched 1:2 with a cohort of standard proctectomy patients (n = 62) using operation, age, gender, and surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perioperative factors were analyzed by univariate/multivariate models for associations with complications graded by Dindo-Clavien criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> ≤ 20 cm from the anal verge underwent proctectomy after hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time from hepatectomy to proctectomy was 5.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> distance was 8.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before proctectomy, patients underwent 28 (90 %) major hepatectomies and 7 (22 %) portal vein embolizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reverse-approach patients did not differ from control patients in operation, demographics, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> distance, operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, or complication rates (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grade 2 or higher complications developed in 42 % of reverse-approach and 27 % of standard proctectomies (p = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or higher complications developed in 10 % and 8 %, respectively (p = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of complications of grade 2 or higher were BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) (p = 0.007), operative time ≥300 min (p = 0.012), intraoperative transfusion (p = 0.044), concurrent procedures (p = 0.024), and age ≥50 years (p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for morbidity of staged proctectomy are similar to those for standard proctectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In selected patients, the reverse-approach proctectomy is safe with acceptable morbidity </plain></SENT>
