<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The validity of progression-free survival (PFS) as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival (OS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) trials has been studied, primarily in first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between PFS and OS has not been well studied in later lines of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of mCRC phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that reported OS and PFS (or time-to-progression [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>]) data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation between endpoints (either PFS alone or PFS aggregated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> [PFS_<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>]) was estimated within treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment effect was the ratio of the median time to OS, PFS, or PFS_<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in the "control" versus "experimental" arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conducted meta-regression analyses and performed receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed data from 62 articles (23,527 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high positive correlation was found between median PFS_<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and median OS within treatment arms (r = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.91) and also between the median OS and median PFS (r = 0.89, 95%â€‰CI, 0.83-0.93)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R(2) was 0.48 for PFS_<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and 0.59 for PFS; R (2) for PFS_<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was higher for first-line (R(2) = 0.54) than second-line studies (R(2) = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ROC analysis is presented as a conceptual tool for evaluating the performance of PFS as a surrogate for OS at various thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of PFS, alone or aggregated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, with OS in clinical trials of patients with mCRC is robust across lines of therapy and provides a useful means of predicting improvements in OS using PFS data </plain></SENT>
