<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To asess the accuracy of FOBT in patients taking <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search was conducted for studies that investigated the accuracy of FOBT in patients taking <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the pooled relative risk (RR) for true positive FOBT for detecting significant colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients taking <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome was a pooled RR for true positive in g-FOBT compared to i-FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five observational studies included 759 patients taking <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and 1652 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients taking <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, pooled RR for true positive FOBT was 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.93, p=0.0009), pooled RR for true positive g-FOBT was 0.69 (95% CI 0.60-0.79, p&lt;0.0001) whereas pooled RR for true positive i-FOBT was 1.013 (95% CI 0.81-1.30, p=0.8182) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five observational studies included 806 patients taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and 10 338 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, pooled RR for true positive FOBT was 1.559 (95% CI 1.349-1.801, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our meta-analysis demonstrate in patients taking <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, there is a decrease in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of g-FOBT, but no significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of i-FOBT compared to control subjects for detecting significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of FOBT was increased for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
