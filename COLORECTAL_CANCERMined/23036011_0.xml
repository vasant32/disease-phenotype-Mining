<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The majority of non-syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>) can be described as a complex disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A two-stage case-control study on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility was conducted to assess the influence of the ancestral alleles in the polymorphisms previously associated with nutrition-related complex diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In stage I, 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a hospital-based Czech population (1025 CRC cases, 787 controls) using an allele-specific PCR-based genotyping system (KASPar(®)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In stage II, replication was carried out for the five SNPs with the lowest p values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The replication set consisted of 1798 CRC cases and 1810 controls from a population-based German study (DACHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were estimated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To identify signatures of selection, Fay-Wu's H and Integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the Czech population, carriers of the ancestral alleles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> rs699 and CYP3A7 rs10211 showed an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR 1.26 and 1.38, respectively; two-sided p≤0.05), whereas carriers of the ancestral allele of ENPP1 rs1044498 had a decreased risk (OR 0.79; p≤0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For rs1044498, the strongest association was detected in the Czech male subpopulation (OR 0.61; p=0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The associations were not replicated in the German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Signatures of selection were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three analyzed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed evidence of association for the ancestral alleles of polymorphisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> and CYP3A7 and for the derived allele of a polymorphism in ENPP1 with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Czechs, but not in Germans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ancestral alleles of these SNPs have previously been associated with nutrition-related diseases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> and CYP3A7) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (ENPP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies may shed light on the complex genetic and environmental interactions between different types of nutrition-related diseases </plain></SENT>
