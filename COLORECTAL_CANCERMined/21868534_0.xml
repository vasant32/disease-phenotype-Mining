<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Homeodomein only protein x (HOPX) gene methylation has frequently been detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of the HOPX gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was examined and compared to the clinocopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples and corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues were obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who underwent surgery at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of the HOPX gene in these samples was examined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the clinicopathological findings were correlated with the methylation status of the HOPX gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HOPX gene methylation was found in 46 (52%) out of the 89 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, suggesting that it was frequently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of methylation was observed in the poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (p=0.0049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HOPX gene methylation could play an important role for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and is closely related to the histological type </plain></SENT>
