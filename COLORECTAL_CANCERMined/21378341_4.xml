<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total 50 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients (46% women, mean age 68 ± 11 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Healthy controls without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> history or family <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> predispositions were frequency-matched to the cases by sex and age (±5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and the genotype distribution and risk estimate were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the genotypes and clinicopathological parameters (Dukes stage, phenotype, location, differentiation and size) among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and T allele-bearing genotype distribution of HIF1A 1772C/T polymorphism (Odds ratio, OR=3.63, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.08-12.18, p = 0.03 for CT and TT genotypes relative to CC genotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, when stratified by age, the association remained in patients older than 60 years old (OR = 13.60, 95% CI = 1.63-113.24, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between the genotypes of the MMP2, VEGF and HIF1A SNP and clinicopathological parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between the HIF1A 1772C/T SNP and the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially in individuals older than 60 years </plain></SENT>
