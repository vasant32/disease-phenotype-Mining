<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine whether <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> is really superior to conventional LCS for prevention of CVC-RBSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between May 2002 and December 2008, 1767 patients received CVC in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time interval from insertion to development of CVC-RBSI was compared retrospectively between selected patients who were treated using the conventional LCS (group 1, n = 89, before June 2006) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi>(group 2, n = 406, June 2006 and after) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant difference in the time interval from insertion to development of CVC-RBSI between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> does not reduce CVC-RBSI in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who undergo CVC insertion </plain></SENT>
