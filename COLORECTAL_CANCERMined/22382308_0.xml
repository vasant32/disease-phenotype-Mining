<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">18F-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> PET/CT, respiratory motion induces bias in image interpretations (i.e. organ misregistration or lesion omission/underestimation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study applied our custom gating method (referred to as 'CT-based gated PET' and that has already been validated by our research group) to PET imaging of the liver and compared its per lesion sensitivity with that of standard clinical (i.e. ungated) PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 13 patients scheduled for liver surgery were referred to our department for PET/CT imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent both ungated and CT-based gated PET imaging protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two independent, blinded observers interpreted the two sets of PET images and reached a consensus when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Image interpretations were combined with histological analysis and/or intraoperative ultrasound examination to compute each method's per lesion sensitivity and true positive fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were also performed by considering lesions according to their size (longest axis over 10 mm or over 15 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight lesions were confirmed by pathology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the uptakes, the ungated and the CT-based gated PET methods had sensitivities of 54.2 and 64.6% (P=0.025) and true positive fractions of 83.9 and 86.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When considering uptakes greater than 10 mm in size, ungated and CT-based gated PET had sensitivities of 74.3 and 88.6% (P=0.025), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For lesions greater than 15 mm in size, the corresponding sensitivities were 85.2 and 100% (P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT-based gated PET yielded a higher lesion-based sensitivity than routine, ungated PET did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence, this method improves the detection of intrahepatic colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>--especially for lesions that are close in size to the detection limit of the PET gantry </plain></SENT>
