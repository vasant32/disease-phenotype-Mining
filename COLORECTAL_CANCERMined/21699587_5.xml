<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the use of preoperative standard oral supplements in a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether preoperative supplements are beneficial in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, patients were assigned to receive 400 mL of oral supplement and dietary advice or dietary advice alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the number of post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-five patients were recruited (59 randomised to the intervention group and 66 to the control group) and nine were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the intervention group, 24 (44%) patients had a complication compared to 26 (42%) in the control group (P = 0.780) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the intervention and control groups, there were eight (15%) and 16 (25%) surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, respectively (P = 0.140) and seven (13%) and 11 (17%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infections</z:e>, respectively (P = 0.470) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis for hypothesis generation included 83 (71%) weight-losing patients, where there was a significant reduction in surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> using the Buzby definition (P = 0.034), although this was not the case for the Centre for Disease Control definition (P = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that preoperative supplements were beneficial in reducing the number of complications, although there may be some benefit for surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in selected weight-losing preoperative patients </plain></SENT>
