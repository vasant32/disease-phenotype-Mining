<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the health effects of specific regional diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Nordic diet is high in fat and sugar but also includes a range of traditional products with anticipated health-promoting effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this cohort study was to determine whether a healthy Nordic food index consisting of fish, cabbage, rye bread, oatmeal, apples, pears and root vegetables was related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from a prospective cohort study of 57,053 Danish men and women aged 50-64 years, of whom 1025 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (13 years' follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95 % CI were calculated from Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women who strongly adhered to a healthy Nordic food index had a 35 % lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than women with poor adherence (adjusted IRR, 0·65; 95 % CI 0·46, 0·94); a similar tendency was found for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women had a 9 % lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> per point adherence to the healthy Nordic food index, but no significant effect was found for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A regional diet based on healthy Nordic food items was therefore associated with a lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effect was of the same magnitude as previously found for the Mediterranean diet, suggesting that healthy regional diets should be promoted in order to ensure health; this will also preserve cultural heredity and the environment </plain></SENT>
