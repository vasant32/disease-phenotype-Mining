<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Practice guidelines recommend that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation for locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> complete postoperative adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, irrespective of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> downstaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Database tracks longitudinal care for patients treated at eight specialty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers across the United States and was used to evaluate how frequently patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy also received postoperative systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics were examined in a multivariable logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between September 2005 and December 2010, 2,073 patients with stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled in the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 1,193 patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were in the analysis, including 203 patients not receiving any adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For those seen by a medical oncologist, the most frequent reason chemotherapy was not recommended was comorbid illness (25 of 50, 50%); the most frequent reason chemotherapy was not received even though it was recommended or discussed was patient refusal (54 of 74, 73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After controlling for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center and clinical TNM stage in a multivariable logistic model, factors significantly associated with not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were age, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status â‰¥ 1, on Medicaid or indigent compared with private insurance, complete pathologic response, presence of re-operation/wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and no closure of ileostomy/colostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even at specialty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers, a sizeable minority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> treated with curative-intent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy do not complete postoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strategies to facilitate the ability to complete this third and final component of curative intent treatment are necessary </plain></SENT>
