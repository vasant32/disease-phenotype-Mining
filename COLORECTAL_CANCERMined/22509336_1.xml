<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs961253 located in 20p12, was firstly described to be associated with the increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a genome-wide association study; however, more recent replication studies yielded controversial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A hospital-based case-control study in a Chinese population was firstly performed, and then a meta-analysis combining the current and previously published studies were conducted to explore the real effect of rs961253 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Chinese population including 641 cases and 1037 controls, per-A-allele conferred an OR of 1.60 (95% CI = 1.26-2.02) under additive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the meta-analysis including 29859 cases and 29696 controls, per-A-allele have an OR of 1.13 (95% CI = 1.09-1.18) under a random-effects model due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> can be totally explained by ethnicity, with the tau(2) reduced to 0 after including ethnicity in meta-regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In stratified analysis by ethnicity, per-A-allele had ORs of 1.34 (95% CI = 1.20-1.50) and 1.11 (95% CI = 1.08-1.14) for Asian and European, respectively, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modest influence of each study was observed on overall estimate in sensitive analysis, and evident tendency to significant association was seen in cumulative analysis over time, together indicating the robust stability of the current results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results from our study and the meta-analysis provided firm evidence that rs961253 significantly contributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in both Asian and European population </plain></SENT>
