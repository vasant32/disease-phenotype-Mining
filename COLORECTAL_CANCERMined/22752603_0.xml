<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The research is to investigate the association between plasma concentrations of total and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin and risk of early and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-five male <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and one hundred and two controls were enrolled; based on the T factor of the TNM system, intraepithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and submucosally invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were defined as early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and invasion into the muscularis propria or deeper was defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and total and HMW adiponectin levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each factor level was designated as low or high, and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was estimated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, high waist/hip ratio (WHR), high fasting insulin, high HOMA model <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR), low total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with a significant increase in the odds ratio (OR) by univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, WHR, HOMA-IR, total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> related to increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e>, only low HMW adiponectin was associated with a significant increase in the OR by univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, a low HMW adiponectin level was still related to increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, with an adjusted OR of 3.971 (P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a decreased level of adiponectin was a strong risk factor not only for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> but also for advanced colorectal in Chinese male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HMW adiponectin might be more closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk than total adiponectin </plain></SENT>
