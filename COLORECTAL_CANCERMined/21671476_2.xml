<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need to search for specific and sensitive biomarkers for early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out a comprehensive systematic review of published studies that compared the miRNA expression profiles between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue and paired neighboring noncancerous colorectal tissue to determine candidate miRNA biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A miRNA ranking system that takes the number of comparisons in agreement, total study sizes and direction of differential expression into the consideration was devised and used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the most up-regulated miRNAs, miRNA-106a, was consistently reported to be differentially expressed in six studies and the five most down-regulated miRNAs, miR-30a-3p, miR-139, miR-145, miR-125a and miR-133a, were consistently reported to be differentially expressed in four studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we further validated five miRNAs in a clinical setting using qRT-PCR, which demonstrated that miR-106a expression was increased, whereas the expression of miR-30a-3p, miR-145, miR-125a and miR-133a was decreased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these miRNAs may be the candidates to develop a panel of biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
