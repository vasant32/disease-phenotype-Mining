<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablative therapies may extend this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reports a single institution's long-term experience with hepatic cryotherapy for advanced CLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 1990 and June 2009, 304 patients were curatively treated with cryotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors for survivals were determined by using univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 293 patients were included into analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of lesions treated per patient was three (range, 1-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 29 (range, 3-220) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survivals were 87%, 41.8%, 24.2%, and 13.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 161 patients developed intrahepatic recurrences: cryosite (23%); edge recurrence (14%); and within the liver remnant (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 (range, 1-220) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year DFS rates were 37.9%, 17.2%, 13.4%, and 10.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified four factors that significantly affect survival: node-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> (p=0.001), preoperative CEA level (p&lt;0.001), number of lesions (p&lt;0.001), and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> nodal status was independently prognostic (hazards ratio=2.023; 95% confidence interval, 1.444-2.835; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic cryotherapy seems to be a safe and effective ablative technique for the treatment of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and may offer long-term survival in otherwise unresectable disease </plain></SENT>
