<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurement for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> during palliative chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with initially unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (n=26, 54.2%) or recurrent unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (n=22, 45.8%) received FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy for palliation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum CEA levels and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels were measured and computed tomography (CT) studies were performed prior to chemotherapy and after 3 cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the CT images, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses were evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> criteria and categorized as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker assessments for determining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of CEA assessment for prediction of disease progression were 50%, 77% and 69%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the patients were dichotomized according to baseline CEA level, the initially elevated CEA group showed higher sensitivity and higher diagnostic accuracy compared to the initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CEA group (sensitivity=67% vs. 20%; diagnostic accuracy=71% vs. 62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEA assessment could be useful for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> during palliative chemotherapy in only patients with initially elevated CEA level </plain></SENT>
