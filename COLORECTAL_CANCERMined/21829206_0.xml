<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Genes of the adiponectin pathway are interesting candidates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk based on the potential association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, variants of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) have been demonstrated to be inconsistently associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The current study attempted to evaluate these findings by examining several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously genotyped as part of a genome-wide association study in the ADIPOQ gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was also performed for a previously reported risk variant, rs266729, in 1062 individuals with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 1062 controls matched on age, gender and ethnicity (Jewish or not Jewish) as part of a population-based case-control study in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No evidence was found for an association between ADIPOQ and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The single nucleotide variant previously associated with decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, rs266729, revealed an adjusted odds ratio of 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The SNP, rs266729, was not strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent or other ethnic groups in Israel </plain></SENT>
