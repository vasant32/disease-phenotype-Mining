<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are noncoding genomic sequences that completely identical among human, mouse, and rat species and harbor critical biologic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within UCEs are associated with clinical outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight SNPs within UCEs were genotyped in 662 patients with stage I through III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations between genotypes and recurrence and survival were analyzed in patients with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who received fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy using a training and validation design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The training set included 115 patients with stage II disease and 170 patients with stage III disease, and the validation set included 88 patients with stage II disease and 112 patients with stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight SNPs were associated with clinical outcomes stratified by disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, for patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who had at least 1 variant allele of reference SNP sequence 7849 (rs7849), a consistent association with increased recurrence risk was observed in the training set (hazard ratio [HR], 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-5.52), in the replication set (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.42-9.64), and in a meta-analysis (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.54-5.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several other SNPs were significant in the training set but not in the validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These included rs2421099, rs16983007, and rs10211390 for recurrence and rs6590611 for survival in patients with stage II disease; and SNPs rs6124509 and rs11195893 for recurrence in patients with stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant cumulative effect was observed of multiple risk genotypes and potential gene-gene interactions on recurrence risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the association between SNPs within UCEs and clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that SNPs within UCEs may be valuable prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
