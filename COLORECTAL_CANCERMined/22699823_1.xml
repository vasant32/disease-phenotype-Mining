<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To identify whether circulating levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related factors may be predictive of bevacizumab efficacy in pre-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pre-treatment serum levels of 24 cytokines were measured using a multiplex bead assay (MBA) in 32 pre-treated mCRC patients treated with irinotecan plus bevacizumab-based salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), interleukins (ILs) 8 and 6 levels were also validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at different time points during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher epidermal growth factor (EGF) and MDC baseline levels (2.2- and 1.4-fold, respectively) and lower IL-10, IL-6 and IL-8 levels (0.2-, 0.6-, and 0.6-fold, respectively, P&lt;0.05) were observed in patients responding to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline levels of these five serum factors compose a risk signature that may define the subset of patients most likely to benefit from bevacizumab-based therapy in terms of response rate and survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between MBA and ELISA results (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment exposure increased MDC and had opposite effects on IL-8 levels, which were decreased (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a set of inflammatory and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>-related serum markers may be associated with the efficacy of bevacizumab-containing regimen </plain></SENT>
