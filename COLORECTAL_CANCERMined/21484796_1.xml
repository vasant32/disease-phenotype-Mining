<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has suggested that <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is accompanied by the <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> polarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An epithelial cell-specific form of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex, AP1B, is involved in the polarized transport of membrane proteins to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, we investigated whether AP1B is involved in intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cellular polarity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumor</z:e> cells was examined using APC(Min/+) mice as an in vivo model and SW480 cells with a truncating mutation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC) gene as an in vitro model by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, the expression of AP1B in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumor</z:e> cells was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The localization of β-catenin and the expression of AP1B in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were evaluated by confocal microscopy and real-time PCR, respectively, and the relationships among cell polarity, AP1B expression and intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular polarity was lost in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumor</z:e> cells, and the expression of AP1B was downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the reduction in the expression level of AP1B correlated with the nuclear localization of β-catenin in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates the close associations between AP1B, intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and mutations in the APC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to reveal the relationships among AP1B, cellular polarity and intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, and achieving a detailed understanding of AP1B will hopefully lead to discovery of therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
