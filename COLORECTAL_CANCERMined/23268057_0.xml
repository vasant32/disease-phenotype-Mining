<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the clinical influence of DMPC on the prognosis of patients with GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1997 and 2009, 1,086 patients underwent curative gastrectomy for GC in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1) 1,086 patients were analyzed, and of these 166 patients (15%) had DMPC and the remaining 920 patients had no DMPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GC patients with DMPC had a significantly higher age (p &lt;0.0001) and higher incidence of differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>(p=0.0045) than those without DMPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) Multivariate analysis showed the presence of DMPC was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was particularly noteworthy that the prognosis of GC patients with hematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, hepato-biliary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> was extremely poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751571" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">urological cancer</z:e> had a comparatively better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of DMPC had little influence on the prognosis of GC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3) In a survival associated with GC, the presence of DMPC had no influence on the prognosis of GC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The types of DMPC had more clinical influence on the prognosis of GC patients than the number of DMPC with respect to overall survival </plain></SENT>
