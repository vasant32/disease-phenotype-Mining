<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is routine practice to perform colonoscopy as a follow-up after an attack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e>, with the main aim to exclude any underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine whether colonoscopy is necessary and what additional information is gained from this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a study of a retrospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND PATIENTS: From January 2003 to June 2009, patients in whom left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> was diagnosed on CT scan were matched with colonoscopy reports within 1 year from the date of CT by the use of radiology and endoscopy databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had colonoscopy within 1 year before the CT scan were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Western Australian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry was cross-referenced to identify patients who subsequently received diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> for whom colonoscopy reports were unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were the number of patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were diagnosed and other incidental findings, eg, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> was diagnosed in 1088 patients on CT scan, whereas follow-up colonoscopy reports were available for 319 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two (26%) patients had incidental findings of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (9 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> &gt;1 cm), and 9 patients (2.8%) received diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> on colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After cross-referencing with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry, the overall prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among the cohort within 1 year of CT scan was 2.1% (23 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds of a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were 6.7 times (95% CI 2.4-18.7) in patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> reported on CT, 4 times (95% CI 1.1-14.9) in patients with local <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and 18 times (95% CI 5.1-63.7) in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> compared with patients with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the unavailability of data for private/interstate hospitals, and the relatively small number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases reduced the statistical power of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We recommend routine colonoscopy after an attack of presumed left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulitis</z:e> in patients who have not had recent colonic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of occult <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> is substantial in this patient population, in particular, when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, local <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> are observed </plain></SENT>
