<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Faecal occult blood (FOB) testing is the most commonly chosen approach in organised population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programmes throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several FOB tests are available which differ in their test qualities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While immunological tests are gaining popularity due to their lower labour intensive analysis and higher standardisation, they are heat labile and more expensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the real-life experience of a large population-based, organised, screening programme in Israel which employs FOB testing with Hemoccult Sensa, a guaiac test with increased sensitivity that is similar to that of the immunological tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clalit Health Services is the largest health care provider in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eligible insurees are actively invited to perform a free-of-charge, home-based, faecal occult blood test, using Hemoccult Sensa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tests with positive results are followed up and information on colonoscopy, surgical procedures and pathology findings is collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an 18 month period (July 2007-December 2008) 382,792 FOBT tests (in 325,851 people) were performed by the target population, of them 85% Jews and 15% Arabs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred and eighteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and 2652 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall test positivity rate in repeatedly-tested people was 4.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall detection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the subsequent tests was 1.7/1000 reflecting 91% of the expected period-incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>70% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected at stages Duke's B2 and lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were detected at a significantly better stage than right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Detection rates among Arabs were somewhat lower than among Jews but the screening programme led to a meaningful increase in national incidence rate in this subgroup by detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> that were otherwise asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Clalit organised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme, using low cost Hemoccult Sensa, has reached the targets of very high detection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, most of them at low stage while keeping a low positivity rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This approach demonstrates an efficient field-tested alternative to other, more costly, screening options </plain></SENT>
