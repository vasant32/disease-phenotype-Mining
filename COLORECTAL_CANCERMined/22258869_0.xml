<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between February 2004 and December 2008 clinicopathological data of 292 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were prospectively collected and analyzed in a "per lesion" study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients with 67 DLMs were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During laparotomy, we identified 45 out of 67 DLMs (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six DLMs were detected by macroscopic liver examination (9%) and 39 (58%) by intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, persistent microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> at pathological examination of the resected specimen or recurrence in situ identified during the follow-up were observed in 41 (61.2%) of 67 LMs that had shown a complete response by imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.016), subglissonian localization of nodules (p = 0.019) and residual microscopic disease (p = 0.0006) were associated with IOUS detection of residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative chemotherapy with more than six cycles (p = 0.022) and intraoperative detection of nodules by IOUS (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systematic US exploration of the liver leads to increase the intraoperative detection rate of DLMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the majority of DLMs identified by IOUS presents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> at pathological examination and should be treated </plain></SENT>
