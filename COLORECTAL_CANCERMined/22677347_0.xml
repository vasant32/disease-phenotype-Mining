<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thoracotomy is considered the gold standard, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is controversial because nonimaged nodules may be missed when bimanual palpation is restricted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Against guideline recommendations, metastasectomy with therapeutic intent is now performed by VATS by 40% of thoracic surgeons surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evidence base for optimal surgical approach is limited to case series and registries, and no comparative surgical studies were observer blinded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients considered eligible for pulmonary metastasectomy by VATS prospectively underwent high-definition VATS by one surgical team, followed by immediate thoracotomy with bimanual palpation and resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> palpable nodules by a second surgical team during the same anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both surgical teams were blinded during preoperative evaluation of CT scans and during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were number and histology of nodules detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 12-month period, 37 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both surgical teams observed exactly 55 nodules suspicious of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> on CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 51 nodules were palpable during VATS (92%), and during subsequent thoracotomy 29 additional nodules were resected: Six (21%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, 19 (66%) were benign lesions, three (10%) were subpleural lymph nodes and one was a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modern VATS technology is increasingly used for pulmonary metastasectomy with therapeutic intent, but several nonimaged, and therefore unexpected, nodules are frequently found during subsequent observer-blinded thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A substantial proportion of these nodules are malignant, and, despite modern imaging and surgical technology, they would have been missed if VATS was used exclusively for metastasectomy with therapeutic intent </plain></SENT>
