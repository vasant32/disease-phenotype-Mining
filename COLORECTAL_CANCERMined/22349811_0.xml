<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous phase III studies raised concern about the safety of the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and irinotecan in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a single arm phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with dose-reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and irinotecan in patients with previously untreated mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated mCRC were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi> was given at 1,000 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 14 days and dose was reduced to 750 mg/m2 for patients over 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Irinotecan was given at 200 mg/m2 and bevacizumab was given at 7.5 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment cycle was repeated every 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival, response rate, and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, the median age was 58, and 54% were ECOG 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3/4 adverse events included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> (14%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (12%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response rate was 51% and disease control rate (response and stable disease) was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI: 9.2-13.7), and 6 month PFS was 90% (95% CI: 77-98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With modest dose reductions, the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, irinotecan, and bevacizumab was well tolerated and resulted in favorable outcomes for patients with previously untreated mCRC </plain></SENT>
