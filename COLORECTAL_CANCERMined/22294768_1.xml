<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over 2000 microRNA (miRNA) sequences from different species have been submitted to the miRBase, the central online repository for miRNAs, making a total of 5071 miRNA loci, expressing 5922 distinct mature miRNA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this review, we have addressed the importance of the genetic variations in humans affecting miRNAs, their target genes and the genes involved in miRNA processing for individual risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, with particular emphasis on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, the number of studies suggesting that individual predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is modulated by genetic polymorphisms affecting the biogenesis of miRNA and the interaction between miRNAs and targets has risen steeply in the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also report the first evidence that variant alleles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within miRNA genes and miRNA targets, previously associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, behave differently when tested in functional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SNPs belonging to the miRNA world are certainly contributing to new insights in the field of the genetic predisposition to disease </plain></SENT>
