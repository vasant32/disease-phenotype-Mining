<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Work over the last decades has uncovered a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor and oncogenes which are frequently mutated and might thus be responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only with the development of new high-throughput technologies systematic analyses of the genome and epigenomes became feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While data generation has increased exponential, we are now faced with new challenges to transform these data into useful models that help predicting the outcome of genomic aberrations and to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a basis for the modeling it is essential to understand and integrate current knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We review previous and current ideas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> development and focus on a pathway oriented view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is a multilayer complex disease affecting the genome as well as the epigenome with direct consequences on the gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The goal is to illustrate the current principles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> pathogenesis and to illustrate the need for elaborate computer modeling systems </plain></SENT>
