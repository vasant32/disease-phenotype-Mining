<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinicopathologic and prognostic data of 1297 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The log-rank statistics, Cox's proportional hazards model, the Nagelkerke R(2) index and a Harrell's C statistic were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate and three-step multivariate analyses identified that LNR was a significant prognostic factor and LNR classification was superior to both the pN and LODDS classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results of the Nagelkerke R(2) index (0.130) and a Harrell's C statistic (0.707) of LNR showed that LNR and LODDS classifications were similar and LNR was a little better than the other two classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, for patients in each LNR classification, prognosis was homologous between those in different pN or LODDS classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, for patients in pN1a, pN1b, LODDS2 and LODDS3 classifications, significant differences in survival were observed among patients in different LNR classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the LNR classification is more suitable than pN and LODDS classifications for prognostic assessment in a Chinese single institutional population </plain></SENT>
