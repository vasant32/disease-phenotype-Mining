<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The life-time incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in individuals with moderate familial risk is 8-17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk of metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (mCRC) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method:  A retrospective longitudinal study of the Regional Familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Registry was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were categorised as follows: moderate risk (n=383), LS (n=528) and population risk (n=409) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimate (1-KM) and cumulative incidence function (CI) were used to calculate the risk of mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1-KM gives the risk for individuals remaining at risk (alive) at a given time point thus is useful for counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CI gives the risk for the whole population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results:  1-KM and CI demonstrated that the risk of mCRC was significantly higher in moderate risk patients compared with population risk (1-KM p= 0.008, CI p= 0.00097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both were lower than LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moderate risk 1-KM was 2.7%, 6.3% and 23.5% at 5,10 and 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Population risk 1-KM was 1.3%, 3.1% and 7.0% at 5, 10 and 20 years and CI was 0.3%, 0.6% and 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  These data indicate that the risk of mCRC is significantly higher in patients with a moderate family history than in those at population risk </plain></SENT>
