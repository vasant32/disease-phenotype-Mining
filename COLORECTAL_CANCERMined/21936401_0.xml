<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To increase the chemopreventive potential of Res in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), a systematic study was carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HCT-116 cells were treated with Res and 5-FU and several cell-based assays, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, clonogenic, wound healing, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>, comet assay, and Western blot, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> were observed when moderate concentration of Res (15 microM) was associated with very low concentration of 5-FU (0.5 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This combination caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by blocking the cells at S phase and enhanced the DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of p-JNK and p-p38 were increased without affecting pERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5-FU could be used as a therapeutic modality to improve efficacy of Res-based chemotherapy against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
