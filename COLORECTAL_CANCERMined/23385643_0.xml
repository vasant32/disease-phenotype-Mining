<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objective of this retrospective study was to determine whether the current staging system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is appropriate and to assess the value of the metastatic lymph node ratio (LNR) in predicting the prognosis of patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2000 to 2006 inclusively, 245 patients with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> underwent curative resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was closed in March 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used for the survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival time of patients with T3N1M0 was significantly better than that for patients in other subgroups of stage IIIB and similar to that of patients with stage IIIA disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest survival difference was found with 0.30 as the LNR cutoff point for patients with current stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival time of patients with LNR ≤ 0.30 was significantly better than that of those with LNR &gt; 0.30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rN1 included stage III patients with LNR ≤ 0.30, and rN2 included patients with LNR &gt; 0.30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival time of patients with T4aN1(rN2)M0 staging was significantly worse than that for patients with T4aN1(rN1)M0 staging and similar to that of patients with stage IIIC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose an algorithm to incorporate LNR into the current American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> staging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In it the patients with T3N1M0 are excluded from the current stage IIIB and included in the stage IIIA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, patients with T4aN1(rN2)M0 are excluded from the current stage IIIB group and included in the stage IIIC group </plain></SENT>
