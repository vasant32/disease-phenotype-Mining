<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acneiform eruptions are the most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicities</z:e> reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They may lead to impairment of patients' quality of life and sometimes may even become severe enough to necessitate the interruption or cessation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective  To assess the possible effect of topical phytomenadione (vitamin K1 ) pre-treatment in diminishing the extent and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo>-like follicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods  A series of 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> were pre-treated with phytomenadione cream (0.05% in seven patients and 0.1% in 13 patients), starting morning before the first infusion of cetuximab or panitumumab, and followed up for the development of therapy-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cream was prepared from phytomenadione solution added to a hydrophilic cream base, oil in water, to obtain the concentration of 0.05% or 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results  Majority of patients (15 out of 20, 75%) pre-treated with phytomenadione cream experienced only mild, grade I acneiform eruptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (25%) had grade II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, which included two of seven patients pre-treated with 0.05% phytomenadione cream and three of 13 patients who used 0.1% phytomenadione cream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Topical phytomenadione cream was well tolerated and no abnormalities in blood coagulation were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions  Topical pre-treatment with phytomenadione cream might become useful in epidermal growth factor inhibitor-associated acneiform eruptions </plain></SENT>
