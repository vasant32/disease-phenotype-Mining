<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated how body size and physical activity influence the risk of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Netherlands Cohort Study (n = 120,852), risk factors were self-reported at baseline in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 7.3 years of follow-up, 603 cases and 4,631 sub-cohort members were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CIMP status according to the Weisenberger markers was determined using methylation specific PCR on DNA from paraffin embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard rate ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for CIMP (27.7%) and non-CIMP (72.3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were calculated according to BMI, BMI at age 20, BMI change, trouser/skirt size, height, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMI modeled per 5 kg/m(2) increase was associated with both CIMP and non-CIMP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, however, HRs were attenuated when additionally adjusted for trouser/skirt size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trouser/skirt size, per 2 size increase, was associated with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes, even after adjustment for BMI (CIMP HR: 1.20, 95%CI: 1.01-1.43; non-CIMP HR: 1.14, 95%CI: 1.04-1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Height per 5 cm was associated with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sub-types, but HRs were attenuated when adjusted for body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMI at age 20 was positively associated with increased risk of CIMP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and the association was significantly less pronounced for non-CIMP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was inversely associated with both subtypes, but a dose-response association was observed only for non-CIMP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P-trend = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Body size, especially central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, may increase the risk of both CIMP and non-CIMP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Body fat at young age may differentially influence risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Physical activity appears to decrease the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> regardless of these molecular subtypes </plain></SENT>
