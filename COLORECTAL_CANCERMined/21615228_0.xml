<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients are now able to undergo at-home treatment by using a portable disposable infusion pump (SUREFUSER(®)A) for continuous intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The duration of continuous 5-FU infusion is normally set at an average of 46 h, but large variations in the duration of infusion are observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The relationship between the total volume of the drug solution in SUREFUSER(®)A and the duration of infusion was analyzed by regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, multiple regression analysis of the total volume of the drug solution, dummy variables for temperature, and duration of infusion was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration of infusion was affected by the coefficient of viscosity of the drug solution and the ambient temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The composition of the drug solutions and the ambient temperature must be considered to ensure correct duration of continuous infusion </plain></SENT>
