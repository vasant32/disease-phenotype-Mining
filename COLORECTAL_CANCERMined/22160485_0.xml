<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In July 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) limited coverage of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (CIA) through a National Coverage Determination (NCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of this study was to compare transfusion rates in patients with CIA with lung, breast, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> before and after the NCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult Medicare patients with CIA treated at 49 community <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> clinics were selected from two time periods based on clinics' NCD implementation date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chart data were abstracted for 12 weeks post-CIA episode start, defined as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) level &lt;11 g/dL while receiving chemotherapy or within 60 days of the last chemotherapy dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses were used to calculate the odds of transfusion and to assess the units of blood transfused, controlling for differences in demographics, clinical history, and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight hundred pre-NCD and 994 post-NCD patients from 49 sites were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 56% used ESAs post-NCD vs. 88% pre-NCD (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of ESA use decreased in the post-NCD (32.1 days) vs. pre-NCD (48.4 days, p &lt; 0.0001) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The post-NCD group reported significantly lower Hb levels, higher odds of receiving a transfusion (odds ratio: 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.89, p = 0.0238) and increased blood utilization of 53% (units transfused: OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.15-2.04, p = 0.0034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased frequency and duration of ESA administration were reported in the post-NCD vs. pre-NCD period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Findings were accompanied by a modest but statistically significant increase in transfusions and a decrease in Hb values </plain></SENT>
