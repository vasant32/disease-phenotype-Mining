<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colovaginal and colovesical fistulae (CVF) are relatively uncommon conditions, most frequently resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high suspicion of a CVF can usually be obtained from an accurate clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demonstrating CVF radiologically is often challenging, and patients frequently undergo a multitude of investigations prior to definitive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm for the investigation of suspected CVF in order to improve diagnosis and subsequent management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven patients from a single NHS Trust with a diagnosis of colovaginal or colovesical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical records and imaging were reviewed retrospectively, and data on demographics, symptoms, investigations, management and outcome were collated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 87.5% patients with a colovesical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> presented with pathognomic symptoms of faecaluria or pneumaturia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The commonest aetiologies were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticular disease</z:e> (72.9%), colonic and gynaecological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (10.8% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computerised tomography (CT) was the most frequently performed investigation (91.9%) and was most sensitive in detecting the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (76.5%) and underlying aetiology (94.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was most sensitive in detecting an underlying colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Resectional surgery was performed in 62.1% of cases, although morbidity and 1-year mortality was significant, with rates of 21.7 and 17.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of CVF is predominately a clinical one, and patients with a suspected CVF are over-investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Investigations should be focused on determining aetiology rather than demonstrating the fistulous tract itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We propose that, in the majority of cases, CT and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy should suffice </plain></SENT>
