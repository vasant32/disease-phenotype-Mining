<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the consistency of Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumours</z:e> (RECIST) application in a phase II trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic non-resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with a combination of an antibody and a chemotherapeutic drug, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scans (thorax, abdomen and pelvis) were performed at baseline and after every fourth treatment cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECIST was intended for response evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scans were consecutively read by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of radiologists as a part of daily work and hereafter retrospectively reviewed by a dedicated experienced radiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agreement on best overall response (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOR</z:e>) between readers and reviewer was quantified using κ-coefficients and the discrepancy rate was correlated with the number of different readers per patient using a χ(2)-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred patients with 396 CT scans were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies between the readers and the reviewer were found in 47 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of discrepancies concerned the application of RECIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the review, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOR</z:e> changed in 17 patients, although, only in six patients the change was potentially treatment altering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the κ-coefficient of agreement between readers and reviewer was 0.71 (good) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in the subgroup of responding patients the κ-coefficient was 0.21 (fair) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with discrepancies was significantly higher with three or more different readers per patient than with less (p =0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RECIST was not consistently applied and the majority of the reader discrepancies were RECIST related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Post review, 17 patients changed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOR</z:e>; six patients in a potentially treatment altering manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that the part of patients with discrepancies increased significantly with more than three different readers per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The findings support a peer-review approach where a few dedicated radiologists perform double blinded readings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the on-going <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> trial patients' CT scans </plain></SENT>
