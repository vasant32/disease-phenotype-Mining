<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are the second and the fourth most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in Iran, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) has been identified in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and its relationship with prognosis is under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the status of MDM2 and its relationship with prognostic factors in gastric and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed on 99 paraffin blocks of gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, during the years 2001 to 2007 from Mostafa Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections were prepared, stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and Eosin and immunohistochemistry to evaluate for MDM2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, lymph node involvement and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 99 cases, 34.3% and 65.7% cases were diagnosed with gastric and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was 5.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MDM2 expression level was 82.4% and 90.8% in gastric and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference was found between MDM2 expression and various prognostic factors; however, significant correlation was observed between gastric (P = 0.03) and colorectal (P = 0.03) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size and the percentage of MDM2 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering the role of MDM2 in cell growth and its positive correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (an established prognostic factor), it can be indirectly concluded that MDM2 is also important in prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, additional investigation is needed </plain></SENT>
