<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 6-year period from 2006 to 2011 at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, a total of 412 patients exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-related chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relevant English-language studies regarding life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e> following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were also reviewed in MEDLINE® and PubMed® search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (1.9%, 8 of 412 cases) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were successful resuscitated without any sequelae and one patient expired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We changed the chemotherapy regimen in five patients and rechallenged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> use in patient 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three relevant English-language studies with 66 patients were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median of 10 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (range, 2 to 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most common symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> (60%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (55%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three fatal events were reported (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (16%) of the 66 cases were rechallenged by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e> must be considered in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-related chemotherapy, especially in heavily pretreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the mechanism, predictors, preventive methods and management of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e> are recommended </plain></SENT>
