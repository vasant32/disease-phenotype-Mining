<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with a false-positive result in a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening programme with the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) in Catalonia between 2000 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of participants of the Catalan <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programme with a positive FOBT who underwent a colonoscopy for diagnostic confirmation from 2000 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A false-positive result was defined as having a positive test but detecting no high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the follow-up colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify sociodemographic and screening variables related to false-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the screening period, 1074 (1.7%) of the 63,332 screening tests had a positive result in the Catalan <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The false-positive proportion was 55.2% (n = 546) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women were more likely to have a positive FOBT in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> than men (adjusted OR = 2.91; 95% CI: 2.22-3.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the first prevalence round, the proportion of false-positive results was higher than in subsequent rounds (69.5% vs. 48.9%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Re-screening and having a <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> pathology such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemorrhoids</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">anal fissures</z:e> were also associated with a false-positive result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proportion of false-positive results and the associated risks should be estimated to provide an eligible population with more reliable information on the adverse effects of screening </plain></SENT>
