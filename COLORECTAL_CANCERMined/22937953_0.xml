<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous (i.v.) regimes Nordic FLOX and Nordic FLIRI, and the partly oral alternatives XELIRI and XELOX are four commonly used chemotherapies in the first-line treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in the Scandinavian countries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with different costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To describe and compare costs associated with four commonly used treatments for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in clinical routine practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional aim was to evaluate the theoretical cost impact of adverse effects associated with the therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective study was carried out using observations and a clinical quality database of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients treated with Nordic FLOX, Nordic FLIRI, XELIRI and XELOX as first line at an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> clinic in Gothenburg, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatments are used in parallel in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated from 2003 to 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome of the therapies was equivalent; mean treatment time was 5.9-7.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A clinical economic evaluation model was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> direct costs associated with the baseline treatment, administration of chemotherapy and drug costs were collected and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximum cost for the four treatments was estimated to be 72 000-75 000 SEK per patient for six months, of this approximately 8000 SEK was linked to treatment of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During six months the i.v. treatments could include 17 more outpatient visits per patient compared to the oral alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During treatment at the clinic around 20% of the patients were hospitalised (XELOX excluded, because of few included patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the four regimens are similar in terms of treatment costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Different costs affect the total cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The oral alternative makes it possible to treat additional patients with the same labour force resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Treatment of adverse effects contributes to extensive resource use at the hospital </plain></SENT>
