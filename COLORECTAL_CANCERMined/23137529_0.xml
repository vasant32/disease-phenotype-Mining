<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: According to the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Comprehensive Network (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and leucovorin (5-FU/LV) is the recommended adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with resected stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age and race are considered strong predictors of chemotherapy receipt, whereas geographic disparity has received minimal attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine geographic variation and sociodemographic disparity in the use of chemotherapy in patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, focusing specifically on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 4106 Medicare patients was identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)/Medicare linked database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics show how <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy was used in various geographic regions among different age and racial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between receipt of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy and geographic region while adjusting for other sociodemographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 49% of the patients with stage III disease received adjuvant chemotherapy within 3 to 6 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>-specific surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients aged 66 to 70 years were 78% more likely to receive chemotherapy than were those aged 80 years and older (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in less urban regions were approximately 42% less likely to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> chemotherapy than those residing in a big metro region (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy use varies across geographic regions, especially for new chemotherapy drugs like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to identify the causes of this geographic disparity and ways to provide high-quality <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients according to their preferences and needs </plain></SENT>
