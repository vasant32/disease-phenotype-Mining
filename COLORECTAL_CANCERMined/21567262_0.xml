<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical procedures are related to the activation of the inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is called surgical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is believed that diminished surgical trauma reduces surgical stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laparoscopic approach reduces trauma, but the systemic immune responses are still invariably activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the main markers in the study of inflammatory or stress response. α-Defensins play an important role in host defense, acting early in phagocytosis. α-Defensins, as early markers-earlier than cytokines-of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, have been used, together with high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), to determine the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in laparoscopic and open colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomized to two groups: group A (n = 20), open colectomy; group B (n = 20), laparoscopic colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hour preoperatively an epidural catheter was placed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and rupivacaine was administered perioperatively and again 48 h postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken for calculating α-defensins, IL-6, and hs-CRP levels preoperatively, 5 min after division of the colon (group A), or 5 min after deflation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> (group B), 6 h and 24 h postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean operative time was 115 min for group A and 142 min for group B (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean blood loss was 240 ml and 105 ml, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was 8 days and 5 days, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). α-Defensin levels were statistically significantly lower in group B than in group A, 5 min and 24 h postoperatively (p &lt; 0.002 and p &lt; 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The IL-6 levels were statistically significantly lower in group B than in group A, 6 h and 24 h postoperatively (p &lt; 0.0001 at both time intervals), whereas the levels of hs-CRP were significantly lower in group B than in group A 24 h postoperatively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the results of previous studies, that the inflammatory immune response and surgical stress are significantly less after laparoscopic colectomy versus open colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More investigation is needed to study if surgical stress has any influence on survival of these patients </plain></SENT>
