<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify those programs fulfilling certain screening evaluation criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Delphi method programs identified were evaluated by a multi-professional expert panel who were asked to provide their consent and recommendations for the implementation, target-group, rescreening interval, primary screening method and social insurance reimbursement level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kuder-Richardson 20 and Cronbach's Î± were used for assessing internal consistency and number of rounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of experts supported the introduction of organized screening programs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and vascular risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major disagreements arose on the target-group of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> program concerning age-limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experts argued that only those fulfilling programs' eligibility criteria or those referred should be reimbursed by social insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recommended screening programs provide for the first time a comprehensive and consensus based proposal for the secondary prevention policy of the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are expected to contribute to the reduction of the disease burden from important health problems and to the optimum allocation of resources invested in health </plain></SENT>
