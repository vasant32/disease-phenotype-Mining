<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferation, differentiation, and transduction aspects of intestinal ontogenesis have been studied here in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, insulin-resistant db/db mice, in fat-1 transgene coding for desaturation of (n-6) PUFA into (n-3) PUFA, in db/db crossed with fat-1 mice, and in control mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in fat-1 mice, colonic proliferation was restrained, accompanied by differentiation of crypt stem cells into epithelial colonocytes and goblet cells and by decrease in colonic β-catenin and HNF-4α transcriptional activities, with concomitant enrichment in HNF-4α-bound (n-3) PUFA at the expense of (n-6) PUFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonic proliferation and differentiation, the profile of β-catenin and HNF-4α-responsive genes, and the composition of HNF-4α-bound PUFA of db/db mice reverted to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> by introducing the fat-1 gene into the db/db context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suppression of intestinal HNF-4α activity by (n-3) PUFA may ameliorate diabesity-induced intestinal ontogenesis and offer an effective preventive modality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
