<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We consider its potential use as a drug loaded strip to provide both mechanical stability to the anastomosis, and as a means to release drug locally over prolonged periods for prevention of locoregional recurrence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we electrospun poly(ε-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17915">caprolactone</z:chebi>) (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>) with the hydrophobic polymer dopant poly(<z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> monostearate-co-ε-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17915">caprolactone</z:chebi>) (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-C18) and used the resultant mesh to control the release of two anticancer drugs (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 and SN-38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in mesh hydrophobicity with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-C18 addition slows drug release both by the traditional means of drug diffusion, as well as by increasing the stability of the entrapped air layer to delay drug release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that superhydrophobic meshes have mechanical properties appropriate for surgical buttressing of the anastomosis, permit non-invasive assessment of mesh location and documentation of drug release via ultrasound, and release chemotherapy over a prolonged period of time (&gt;90 days) resulting in significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytotoxicity against a human colorectal cell line (HT-29) </plain></SENT>
