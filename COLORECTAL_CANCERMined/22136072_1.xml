<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A collection of chemometrics methods including multiple linear regression (MLR), factor analysis-based multiple linear regression (FA-MLR), principal component regression (PCR), and partial least squared combined with genetic algorithm for variable selection (GA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>) were employed to make connections between structural parameters and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in three different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Models of high statistical qualities were obtained for each cell line using GA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that 2D autocorrelation descriptors and dipole moments as a quantum chemical parameter are important structural parameters that significantly influence the activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the determinant descriptors for activity of compounds in H1299 cell line were partly different from the two other cell lines, which might be deduce that the studied compounds induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through a different mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
