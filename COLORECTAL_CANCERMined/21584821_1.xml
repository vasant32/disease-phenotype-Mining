<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1998 and December 2005, 1,672 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients undergoing operation were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two groups according to the presentation: patients with complete obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi>, n = 215) receiving emergency procedures and patients with non-obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (NOC, n = 1,457) receiving elective procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data on the clinicopathologic characteristics and short-term and long-term outcomes of patients were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1,672 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, 215 cases presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location and size, macroscopic type, depth of invasion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e>, and TNM stage were found to be different between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> and NOC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, depth of invasion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> were independent factors associated with obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with obstruction had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by a factor of 2.251 compared to patients without obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> and TNM stage were independent factors for the survival of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Obstruction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> macroscopic type, and TNM stage were independent indicators for postoperative recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality was significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> group than the NOC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> group were 47.8% and 42.8%, respectively, compared to 67.2% and 59.8% in the NOC group, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The postoperative recurrence rates were 43.1% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> group and 32.8% in the NOC group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Obstruction is an independent indicator for the survival and postoperative recurrence for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> group have worse overall survival with high postoperative recurrence rate compared to those in the NOC group </plain></SENT>
