<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Screening decreases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence and mortality, yet almost half of age-eligible patients are not screened at recommended intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether interventions using electronic health records (EHRs), automated mailings, and stepped increases in support improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening adherence over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 4-group, parallel-design, randomized, controlled comparative effectiveness trial with concealed allocation and blinded outcome assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00697047) SETTING: 21 primary care medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 4675 adults aged 50 to 73 years not current for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Usual care, EHR-linked mailings ("automated"), automated plus telephone assistance ("assisted"), or automated and assisted plus nurse navigation to testing completion or refusal ("navigated") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interventions were repeated in year 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The proportion of participants current for screening in both years, defined as colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy (year 1) or fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in year 1 and FOBT, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy (year 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with those in the usual care group, participants in the intervention groups were more likely to be current for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for both years with significant increases by intensity (usual care, 26.3% [95% CI, 23.4% to 29.2%]; automated, 50.8% [CI, 47.3% to 54.4%]; assisted, 57.5% [CI, 54.5% to 60.6%]; and navigated, 64.7% [CI, 62.5% to 67.0%]; P &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pair-wise comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increases in screening were primarily due to increased uptake of FOBT being completed in both years (usual care, 3.9% [CI, 2.8% to 5.1%]; automated, 27.5% [CI, 24.9% to 30.0%]; assisted, 30.5% [CI, 27.9% to 33.2%]; and navigated, 35.8% [CI, 33.1% to 38.6%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Participants were required to provide verbal consent and were more likely to be white and to participate in other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening, limiting generalizability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care, a centralized, EHR-linked, mailed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program led to twice as many persons being current for screening over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Assisted and navigated interventions led to smaller but significant stepped increases compared with the automated intervention only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rapid growth of EHRs provides opportunities for spreading this model broadly </plain></SENT>
