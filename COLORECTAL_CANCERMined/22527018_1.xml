<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Numerous immunohistochemically detectable proteins, such as immune cell surface (CD) proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinases, have been proposed as potential prognostic markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of reproducibility has been a major problem in validating the clinical use of such markers, and this has been attributed to insufficiently robust methods used in immunohistochemical staining or its assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed how computer-assisted image analysis might contribute to the reliable assessment of positive area percentage and immune cell density in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens, and subsequently, we applied the computer-assisted cell counting method in assessing the prognostic value of T cell infiltration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The computer-assisted analysis methods were based on separating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and diaminobenzidine color layers and then applying a brightness threshold using open source image analysis software ImageJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that computer-based analysis results in a more reproducible assessment of the immune positive area percentage than visual semiquantitative estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer-assisted immune cell counting was rapid to perform and accurate (Pearson r &gt; 0.96 with exact manual cell counts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the computer-assisted determination of peritumoral and stromal T cell density had independent prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that computer-assisted image analysis, utilizing freely available image analysis software, provides a valuable alternative to semiquantitative assessment of immunohistochemical results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research, as well as in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The advantages of using computer-assisted analysis include objectivity, accuracy, reproducibility, and time efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study supports the prognostic value of assessing T cell infiltration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
