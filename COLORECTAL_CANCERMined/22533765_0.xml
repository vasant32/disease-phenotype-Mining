<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Secure manipulation of forceps in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> is sometimes hindered by the characteristics of that organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SB knife Jr, which are scissor forceps using a mono-pole high frequency, were developed to avoid the difficulty of ESD operation in the colorectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of the SB knife Jr in colorectal ESD in 11 hospitals, mostly in northeastern Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: One hundred and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> (49 non-granular laterally spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> [LST] lesions, 39 granular LST lesions and 14 other lesions) that were resected by ESD operations using SB knife Jr between October 2009 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (102/102) were resected en bloc and could be observed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the resected pieces was 40.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean operation time was 54.2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the complications, one case of micro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred during the manipulation of submucosal dissection, and this case was treated with clips in that operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of resection carried out only with SB knife Jr were 74.5% (76/102) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The novel ESD using SB knife Jr in the colorectum offers a breakthrough in resection techniques for not only expert endoscopists but also general endoscopists </plain></SENT>
