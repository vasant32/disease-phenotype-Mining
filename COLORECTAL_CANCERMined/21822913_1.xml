<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> received either casopitant or placebo intravenously (IV) added to ondansetron 8 mg bid oral on study days 1 to 3 and one dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 8 mg IV given prior to starting the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>/retching or use of rescue medication) during 120 h after initiation of chemotherapy in cycle 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in the rate of CR was noted in the casopitant group compared to the placebo group for the overall (placebo 85%, casopitant 86%, p = 0.7273), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (placebo 96%, casopitant 97%), or delayed phases (placebo 85%, casopitant 86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average area under curve (0-âˆž) of casopitant after a single 90-mg IV dose was 8,390 ng h/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h after casopitant 90-mg IV dosing, the plasma casopitant concentration was 24% lower than the values noted in prior studies with 150 mg oral administration, and the plasma exposure of the major metabolite (GSK525060) was 18% lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of single-dose casopitant 90 mg IV did not improve the control of CINV at any time during 120 h following initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based MEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excellent control of CINV was achieved in this study population with the combination of ondansetron and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
