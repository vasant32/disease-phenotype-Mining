<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> promotes cell-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, is expressed by neurons, and activates proteins that signal at synapses, we hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> expression by neurons regulates synaptic function and plasticity in the adult brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> is enriched in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, and we demonstrate that selective deletion of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> from neurons in the adult forebrain results in the loss of long-term potentiation (LTP), intact long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, shorter dendritic spines, and impaired spatial and recognition memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LTP induction requires Src activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor (NMDAR) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> deletion severely reduced Src activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that enhancing NMDAR function or activating Src rescues LTP in the absence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> activation of Src is required for NMDAR-dependent LTP and certain forms of learning and memory </plain></SENT>
