<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effect of systematic callup and prophylactic colectomy on FAP survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed, treated and followed-up at our institution were analysed. 'Callups' were those identified via the callup system; 'probands' were those identified by other means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proportions were analysed by Chi-squared or Fischer's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates were indirectly standardised to the UK population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival curves from birth were estimated by Kaplan-Meier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 439 patients (293 callups, 146 probands) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Crude mortality rates (CMRs) of callups and probands were 4.85 per 1,000 person years (PY) and 9.71 per 1,000 PY, respectively-a rate ratio of 0.50 (95% CI 0.34-0.72, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of callups was non-significantly lower than probands (4.12 vs. 4.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Callups experienced non-significantly lower age-band specific SMR up to 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More probands died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (42.4 vs. 22.5%, P = 0.025), whereas more callups died of ECM (30.6 vs. 13.4%, P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 64 years for callups and 60 years for probands; survival curves did not differ significantly (P = 0.253) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The crude mortality rate of callups is approximately half that of probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As fewer callups die of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, a greater proportion die of ECMs </plain></SENT>
