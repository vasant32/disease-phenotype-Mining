<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rho GTPases are key regulators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell invasion and therefore constitute attractive targets for the design of anticancer agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several strategies have been developed to modulate their increased activities during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, none of these approaches took into account the existence of the well-known antagonistic relationship between RhoA and Rac1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we first compared the invasiveness of a collection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines with their RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A marked decrease of active Cdc42 and Rac1 correlated with the high invasive potential of the cell lines established from metastatic sites of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (LoVo, SKCo1, SW620 and CoLo205) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no correlation between RhoA activity and invasiveness was detected, whereas the activity of its kinase effector ROCK was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines with a more invasive phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, invasiveness in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines was correlated with a typical round and blebbing <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then tested whether treatment with PDGF to restore Cdc42 and Rac1 activities and/or with Y27632, a chemical inhibitor of ROCK, could decrease the invasiveness of SW620 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association of both treatments substantially decreased the invasive potential of SW620 cells and this effect was accompanied by loss of membrane blebbing, restoration of a more elongated cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and re-establishment of E-cadherin-dependent adherens junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study paves the road to the development of therapeutic strategies in which different Rho GTPase modulators are combined to modulate the cross-talk between Rho GTPases and their specific input in metastatic progression </plain></SENT>
