<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> to the ovary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 3776 female patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> seen at MD Anderson from 2001-2008, 110 (2.9%) were identified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to the ovary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to examine the survival functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (64.5%) had disease metastatic to the ovary at the time of initial presentation; in 39 patients (35.5%) the ovaries were a site of relapse after previous curative colorectal surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented with ovarian relapse after previous colorectal surgery and who underwent oophorectomy had a median survival of 50 months compared with 12 months for those who did not (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at the time of presentation who underwent oophorectomy had a median survival of 39.4 months vs. 18.2 months for those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis suggests that women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> metastatic to the ovary may derive a survival benefit from palliative oophorectomy </plain></SENT>
