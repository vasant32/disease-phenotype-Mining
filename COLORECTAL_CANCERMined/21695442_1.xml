<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lymph node ratio (LNR: the ratio of metastatic to total retrieved nodes) has shown prognostic significance in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its role in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> submitted to laparoscopic resection is still not clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of LNR on long-term outcome in patients undergoing curative laparoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients' data were retrieved from our prospective in-hospital collected data of patients that underwent laparoscopic surgery for curable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term data were collected from our outpatient's clinic data and personal contact when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients underwent laparoscopic resection for curable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients were node positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis selected 0.13 as the best LNR cutoff value in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival analysis revealed a significant decrease in overall and disease-free survival in patients with an LNR above 0.13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome of patients with an LNR below 0.13 was similar to node-negative stage II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lymph node ratio is a valuable prognostic factor in node-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients undergoing laparoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with an LNR below 0.13 have the same long-term outcome as stage II node-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The laparoscopic approach presents the same trends in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival as conventional open access when LNR is considered </plain></SENT>
