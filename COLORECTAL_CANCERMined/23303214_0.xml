<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this has not been evaluated under current standard-of-care regimens of chemotherapy in combination with targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted an analysis of published mCRC trials of chemotherapy and targeted therapies from 2000 to evaluate the surrogacy of PFS and response rate (RR) for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study-level data was pooled from 24 randomized mCRC trials that evaluated fluoropyrimidine-based regimens and included trials conducted with targeted agents (panitumumab, cetuximab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 69 treatment arms with a sample size of 20,438 patients was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis was carried out to estimate the correlation of PFS and RR with OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient between PFS HRs and OS HRs was 0.86 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trials, 0.89 for 12 phase III trials of targeted agents in combination with chemotherapy, 0.95 for 8 first-line phase III trials of targeted agents, and 0.83 for 9 trials of anti-EGFR-targeted agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, correlation coefficients between RR and OS HRs were lower than those between PFS HRs and OS HRs (range, 0.42-0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study-level analysis of randomized mCRC trials of chemotherapy and targeted agents, improvements in PFS are strongly correlated with improvements in OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that PFS remains a valid surrogate endpoint for OS with current treatment regimens in the mCRC setting </plain></SENT>
