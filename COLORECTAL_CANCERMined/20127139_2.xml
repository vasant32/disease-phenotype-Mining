<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who had failed one or two previous chemotherapeutic regimens that included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and/or irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a Phase II, multicentre, open-label, randomised, two-arm, parallel-group study comparing AZD6244 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received either 100 mg twice daily oral AZD6244 free-base suspension every day or 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest period, in 3-weekly cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the number of patients experiencing disease progression events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were randomised in the study (34 and 35 patients in the AZD6244 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease progression events were experienced by 28 patients (~80%) in both the AZD6244 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 81 days and 88 days in the AZD6244 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients in the AZD6244 treatment arm had a best response of stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, best response was a partial response in one patient, with stable disease in a further 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequently observed adverse events reported with AZD6244 were acneiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo>, diarrhoea, asthenia and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e>, diarrhoea, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AZD6244 showed similar efficacy to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> in terms of the number of patients with a disease progression event and of progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AZD6244 is currently undergoing evaluation in Phase II trials in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
