<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deleterious mutations in human MSH2 account for approximately half of the alleles associated with a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027672" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary cancer syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we characterized clinically identified MSH2 missense mutations, using yeast as a model system, and found that the most common cause of defective DNA mismatch repair was low levels of the variant Msh2 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that increased protein turnover is responsible for the reduced cellular levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increasing gene dosage of more than half of the missense alleles fully restored function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A titration experiment revealed that raising the expression level of one variant to less than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> levels restored mismatch repair, suggesting that overexpression is not always required to regain function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation pathway is the major mechanism for increased turnover of the Msh2 variants and identified the primary ubiquitin ligase as San1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletion of San1 restored protein levels for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one variant, but did not elevate <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Msh2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unstable variants interacted with San1, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Msh2 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, san1Î” suppressed the mismatch repair defect of unstable variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of medical significance, the clinically approved drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> partially restored protein levels and mismatch repair function for low-level variants and reversed the resistance to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, a common chemotherapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results provide the foundation for an innovative therapeutic regime for certain mismatch-repair-defective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> that are refractory to conventional chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
