<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR) is a quality benchmark for colonoscopy, influenced by several factors including bowel preparation, withdrawal time, and withdrawal technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of video recording of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies on the ADR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Comparison of two cohorts of patients undergoing colonoscopy before and after implementation of video recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic outpatient endoscopy facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: This study involved asymptomatic, average-risk adults undergoing screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Video recording of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopy procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>Polyp</z:mpath> findings and withdrawal times were recorded for 208 consecutive screening colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A policy of video recording <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies was implemented and announced to the staff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data on another 213 screening colonoscopies were subsequently collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate, withdrawal time, advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was found in 38.5% of patients after video recording versus 33.7% before video recording (P = .31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath> detection rate (44.1% vs 34.6%; P = .046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most endoscopists had a numerical increase in their ADRs, but only one was significant (57.7% vs 22.6%; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were trends toward higher detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> of &lt;5 mm (59.1% vs 52%; P = .23) and right-sided <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (40.2% vs 30.4%; P = .11) in the video recorded group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: No randomization, confounding of intervention effects, and sample size limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Video recording of colonoscopies is associated with a nonsignificant increase in the ADR and a significant increase in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyp</z:mpath> detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There may be a benefit of video recording for endoscopists with low ADRs </plain></SENT>
