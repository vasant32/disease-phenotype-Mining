<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy often is used as treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and studies have documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> in patients after chemotherapy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>What remains unclear is the impact of such changes on a person's roles and relationships, herein referred to as psychosocial adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this research was to explore group differences in psychosocial adjustment and chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were assessed cross-sectionally, at various time points along their treatment trajectory, using the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report (PAIS-SR) and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistically nonsignificant negative association was indicated between PAIS-SR and CANTAB results, indicating that they would have no meaning in a clinical context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences between groups were observed in terms of cognitive ability; however, patients who completed chemotherapy appeared to be at a higher risk for psychosocial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0281902" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">maladjustment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> do not influence patients' relationships and functional roles, as indicated from the PAIS-SR </plain></SENT>
