<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now assessed long-term clinical efficacy including disease-free survival and disease outcomes in patients receiving anastrozole or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ABSCG-12 is a randomised, controlled, open-label, two-by-two factorial, multicentre trial in 1803 premenopausal women with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>-receptor-positive early-stage (stage I-II) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> receiving goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days), comparing the efficacy and safety of anastrozole (1 mg per day) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (20 mg per day) with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> (4 mg every 6 months) for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation (1:1:1:1 ratio) was computerised and based on the Pocock and Simon minimisation method to balance the four treatment arms across eight prognostic variables (age, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage; lymph-node involvement, type of surgery or locoregional therapy, complete axillary dissection, intraoperative radiation therapy, and geographical region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment allocation was not masked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (defined as disease recurrence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) and analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00295646; follow-up is ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: At a median follow-up of 62 months (range 0-114.4 months), more than 2 years after treatment completion, 186 disease-free survival events had been reported (53 events in 450 patients on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> alone, 57 in 453 patients on anastrozole alone, 36 in 450 patients on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi>, and 40 in 450 patients on anastrozole plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">Zoledronic acid</z:chebi> reduced risk of disease-free survival events overall (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.91; p=0.009), although the difference was not significant in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44-1.03; p=0.067) and anastrozole arms (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45-1.02; p=0.061) assessed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">Zoledronic acid</z:chebi> did not significantly affect risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> vs 43 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> without; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41-1.07; p=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in disease-free survival between patients on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> alone versus anastrozole alone (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.81-1.44; p=0.591), but overall survival was worse with anastrozole than with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (46 vs 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.08-2.83; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatments were generally well tolerated, with no reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the jaw </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> improved disease-free survival in the patients taking anastrozole or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in disease-free survival between patients receiving anastrozole and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> overall, but those on anastrozole alone had inferior overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data show persistent benefits with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> and support its addition to adjuvant <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> therapy in premenopausal patients with early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
