<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An "an area under the curve" cost-effectiveness model was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical effectiveness evidence for both cetuximab and panitumumab was taken from a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) in each case and for cetuximab plus irinotecan from several sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients are predicted to survive for approximately 6 months on BSC, 8.5 months on panitumumab, 10 months on cetuximab, and 16.5 months on cetuximab plus irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Panitumumab is dominated, and cetuximab is extended dominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £95,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was estimated for cetuximab versus BSC and is likely to be relatively accurate, because the relevant clinical evidence is taken from a high-quality RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated ICER for panitumumab versus BSC, at £187,000 per QALY, is less certain due to assumptions in the adjustment for the substantial crossing-over of patients in the RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ICER for cetuximab plus irinotecan versus BSC, at £88,000 per QALY, is least certain due to substantial uncertainty about progression-free survival, treatment duration, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, when key parameters are varied within plausible ranges, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three treatments always remain poor value for money </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three treatments are highly unlikely to be considered cost-effective in this patient population in the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
