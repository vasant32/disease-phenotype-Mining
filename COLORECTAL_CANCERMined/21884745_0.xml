<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, analyses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes and several molecular markers have also shown promising prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the proto-oncogene KRAS, which occur early in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, have been demonstrated to be common in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>); however, their prognostic significance remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the correlations between KRAS mutational status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating immune cells with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in KRAS were identified in 45.5% of the primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in our cohort of patients: 65% in codon 12 and 35% in codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although codon 13 KRAS mutations were associated with disease relapse, they were present in both disease-free and relapsed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, disease-free and relapsed patients differed markedly in their patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward decreased density of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the group of relapsed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, relapsed patients with codon 13 mutations had markedly lower levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating mature DC-LAMP(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and higher frequency of CD1a(+) cells compared with disease-free patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with low levels of TILs, a high CD1a(+)/DC-LAMP(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating DC ratio, and a KRAS mutation in codon 13 are at a high risk of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
