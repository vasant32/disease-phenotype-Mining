<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether FOLFOX or FOLFIRI is administered first is not significant, however, it is essential that full administration of the targeted dosages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 drugs, 5-FU, l-OHP and SN-38, is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this is not always possible and second-line chemotherapy must be abandoned in certain cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Where possible, the most effective regimen should be selected as the first line of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether first-line chemotherapy may be individualized using the collagen gel droplet-embedded drug sensitivity test (CD-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> were obtained from 43 CRC patients who had received no preoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Informed consent to measure drug sensitivity was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CD-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> allows evaluation of drug sensitivity using isolated, 3-dimensionally cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in a small collagen gel droplet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CD-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="38291">DST</z:chebi> was performed and the growth inhibition rate (IR) was obtained under incubation conditions (5-FU with l-OHP at 6.0 and 3.0 μg/ml, or 5-FU with SN-38 at 6.0 and 0.2 μg/ml, respectively, for 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative distributions of the growth IRs under each condition were evaluated based on the evidence that the clinical response rates to FOLFOX and FOLFIRI were almost the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Individualization of first-line treatment was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with FOLFOX and FOLFIRI showing higher efficacy in 26 and 15 patients, respectively, and equal efficacy in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This method has the potential to facilitate the establishment of individualized first-line chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and improve the prognosis in such patients </plain></SENT>
