<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a quite limited number of active drugs have been approved for clinical applications, a variety of combined delivery regimen options are actually used in the clinic, so that choosing between them, or designing new ones, is not an obvious task, which calls for some rationalization based on physiological principles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose some physiologically based molecular pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics models for the main cytotoxic drugs used in the clinic and call for others describing more recently used agents, such as associated with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also advocate simultaneously designing models of the proliferating cell populations under therapeutic control, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is primarily a disruption of physiological control on tissue proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two types of models are based on diﬀerential equations to continuously describe both the fate of drugs in the organism, from infusion until pharmacological eﬀects, and their impact on the proliferation of cell populations, healthy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multiscale nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, from the disruption of intracellular pathways to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> observed at the macroscopic level, together with its frequent multilocal extension by simultaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in various healthy tissues of the organism at the time of diagnosis, and later, call for multiscale mathematical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We thus propose a multi-level vision of cytotoxic drug use in the clinic, in which the weapon in the hands of clinicians, a drug combination regimen, the targets -wanted and unwanted - on which it exerts its eﬀects, molecular pathways in proliferating cell populations, and the environment of the latter in a whole organism, are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> considered in order to design a rationale for appropriate shooting, i.e., treatment optimization under patient-tailored constraints </plain></SENT>
