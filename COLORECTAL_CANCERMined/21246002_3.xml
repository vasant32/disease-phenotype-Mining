<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the relation between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk by reviewing the related studies until September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the strength of relation between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen published case-control studies including 5336 cases and 6226 controls were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pooled OR with 95% CI indicated that CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism was significantly related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.86, P = 0.002; dominant model: OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75, P = 0.04; recessive model: OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.18-1.88, P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup ethnicity analysis showed that CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism was also significantly related with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in Europeans (Ile/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.42, P = 0.008; dominant model: OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.43, P = 0.004) and Asians (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07-1.82, P = 0.01; recessive model: OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.12-1.89, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CYP1A1 Ile462Val may be an increased risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
