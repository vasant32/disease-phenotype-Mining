<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally believed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> arises due to mutations that disrupt the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellular dynamics of the crypts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a spatially structured cell-based model of a colonic crypt, we investigate the likelihood that the progeny of a mutated cell will dominate, or be sloughed out of, a crypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our approach is to perform multiple simulations, varying the spatial location of the initial mutation, and the proliferative and adhesive properties of the mutant cells, to obtain statistical distributions for the probability of their domination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our simulations lead us to make a number of predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The process of monoclonal conversion always occurs, and does not require that the cell which initially gave rise to the population remains in the crypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations occurring more than one to two cells from the base of the crypt are unlikely to become the dominant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of a mutant clone persisting in the crypt is sensitive to dysregulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By comparing simulation results with those from a simple one-dimensional stochastic model of population dynamics at the base of the crypt, we infer that this sensitivity is due to direct competition between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant cells at the base of the crypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also predict that increases in the extent of the spatial domain in which the mutant cells proliferate can give rise to counter-intuitive, non-linear changes to the probability of their fixation, due to effects that cannot be captured in simpler models </plain></SENT>
