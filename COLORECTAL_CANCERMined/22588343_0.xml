<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of published studies to quantitatively summarize the association between NAT2 polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant studies that had investigated NAT2 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility were identified through a comprehensive search of Pubmed, EMBASE, Medline, Biosis, Wiley-Blackwell, ISI Web of Knowledge, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Database until October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After selection based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the relevant data were extracted from each study, and finally a meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight phenotype studies (791 cases and 1158 controls) and 45 genotype studies (13 875 cases and 18 879 controls) were included in the present meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pooling of phenotype studies showed no significant association between the NAT2 acetylator status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility (rapid acetylator, OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.92-1.89, P=0.14; slow acetylator, OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.53-1.09, P=0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined ORs for rapid and slow acetylator status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in genotype studies were 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94-1.08; P=0.86) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93-1.06; P=0.86), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis by regions, no increased risks were found in Asians, Europeans, Americans, or Australasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pooling studies were also conducted on the groups of gender, specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sites, and smoking status, but no significant association in genotype distribution between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and control was found as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results of our meta-analysis suggest that there is no overall association between NAT2 polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
