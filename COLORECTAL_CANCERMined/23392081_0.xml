<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This population-based study was undertaken to identify the principal differences in disease characteristics and management that accounted for previously observed poorer survival in English compared with French patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population comprised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 1997 and 2004 in the areas covered by three population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in France and one in England (N=40 613) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the influence of clinical and treatment variables on survival, we applied multivariable excess hazard modelling based on generalised linear models with Poisson error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Poorer survival for English patients was primarily due to a larger proportion dying within the first year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After controlling for inter-country differences in the use of chemotherapy and surgical resection with curative intent, country of residence was no-longer associated with 1-year survival for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients (excess hazard ratio (EHR)=0.99 (0.92-1.01), P=0.095)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longer term (2-5 years) excess hazards of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients did not differ between France and England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that difference in management close to diagnosis of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e> is related to differences in survival observed between France and England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> efforts (collection and standardisation of additional variables such as co-morbidity) to investigate the reasons for these disparities in management between these two countries, and more generally across Europe, should be encouraged </plain></SENT>
