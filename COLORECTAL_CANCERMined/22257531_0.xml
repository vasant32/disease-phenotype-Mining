<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in India, coupled with absence of specialized units, contribute to lack of relevant data arising from the subcontinent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the data of the senior author to better define the requirements that would enable development of specialized units in a country where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> burden is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 401 consecutive colorectal resections from a prospective database of the senior author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to patient demographics and types of resections, perioperative data like intraoperative blood loss, duration of surgery, complications, re-operation rates and hospital stay were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 52 years (10-86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>279 were males and 122 were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average duration of surgery was 220.32 minutes (range 50-480 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was 12.2% (49/401) with a 1.2% (5/401) mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients having complications had an increase in their median hospital stay (from 10.5 days to 23.4 days) and the re-operation rate in them was 51% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major complications were anastomotic leaks (2.5%) and stoma related complications (2.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This largest ever series from India compares favorably with global standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a nation where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is on the rise, it is imperative that high volume centers develop specialized units to train future specialist colorectal surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This would ensure improved quality assurance and delivery of health care even to outreach, low volume centers </plain></SENT>
