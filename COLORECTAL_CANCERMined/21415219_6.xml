<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical utility of metabonomics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> remains to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment serum metabolic profiles generated by (1)H NMR spectroscopy on toxicity in patients with inoperable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> receiving single agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum was collected from 54 patients with a diagnosis of locally advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> prior to treatment with single agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1)H NMR spectroscopy was used to generate metabolic profile data for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were graded according to National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>-derived <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> predicted for higher grade toxicity over the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses revealed a "pharmacometabonomic" <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile that correlated with severity of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that metabolic profiles can delineate subpopulations susceptible to adverse events and have a potential role in the assessment of treatment viability for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients prior to commencing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
