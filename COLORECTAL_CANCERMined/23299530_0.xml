<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody with clinical benefit in previously treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with mCRC who had progressed following first-line therapy were randomised 1:1:1 to modified (m)FOLFOX6 plus cediranib (20 or 30 mg day(-1)) or bevacizumab (10 mg kg(-1) every 2 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between treatment arms.Results:A total of 210 patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis (cediranib 20 mg, n=71; cediranib 30 mg, n=73; bevacizumab, n=66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median PFS in the cediranib 20 mg, cediranib 30 mg and bevacizumab groups was 5.8, 7.2 and 7.8 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms for PFS (cediranib 20 mg vs bevacizumab: HR=1.28 (95% CI, 0.85-1.95; P=0.29); cediranib 30 mg vs bevacizumab: HR=1.17 (95% CI, 0.77-1.76; P=0.79)) or overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade â‰¥ 3 adverse events were more common with cediranib 30 mg (91.8%) vs cediranib 20 mg (81.4%) or bevacizumab (84.8%).Conclusion:There were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms for PFS or OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When combined with mFOLFOX6, the 20 mg day(-1) dose of cediranib was better tolerated than the 30 mg day(-1) dose </plain></SENT>
