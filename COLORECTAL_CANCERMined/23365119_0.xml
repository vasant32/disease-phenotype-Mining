<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Thyroid cancer</z:e> cells are also comparatively refractory to RAF inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo>, inhibition of MAPK signaling by vemurafenib is transient in thyroid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rebound in ERK in thyroid cells is accompanied by increased HER3 signaling caused by induction of HER3 transcription through decreased promoter occupancy by the transcriptional repressors CtBP1 and 2, and by autocrine secretion of neuregulin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HER kinase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49603">lapatinib</z:chebi> prevents MAPK rebound and sensitizes BRAF-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thyroid cancer</z:e> cells to RAF or MEK inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This provides a rationale for combining ERK pathway <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> with inhibitors of feedback-reactivated HER signaling in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The determinants of primary resistance to MAPK inhibitors vary between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, due to preferential upregulation of specific RTKs, and the abundance of their respective ligands </plain></SENT>
