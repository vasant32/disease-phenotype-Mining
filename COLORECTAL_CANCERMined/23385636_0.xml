<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to compare efficacy and tolerability of different endoscopic resection methods for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with non-pedunculated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> undergoing endoscopic treatments were consecutively enrolled, and their medical records were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resection methods were classified into three groups: endoscopic mucosal resection with circumferential precutting (EMR-P), endoscopic submucosal dissection with snaring (ESD-S), and endoscopic submucosal dissection alone (ESD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared en bloc resection, pathological complete resection, and complications associated with these methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 206 lesions from 203 patients were included in the study (mean size 25.2 ± 10.1 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of lesions treated with EMR-P, ESD-S, and ESD was 91 (44.2 %), 57 (27.7 %), and 58 (28.2 %), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in both the en bloc resection rates (EMR-P, 61.5 %; ESD-S, 64.9 %; ESD, 96.6 %; p = 0.001) and complete resection rates (EMR-P, 51.6 %; ESD-S, 54.4 %; ESD, 75.9 %; p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> were less frequently observed in the EMR-P group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup-analysis of lesions less than 20 mm, however, these differences were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> endoscopic resection methods, including EMR-P, ESD-S, and ESD, were effective and safe for the treatment of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Technically demanding ESD with high en bloc and complete resection rate should be reserved for the suspicious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> lesion, which requires the precise histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EMR-P with good feasibility can be considered an alternative to ESD for the lesions less than 20 mm </plain></SENT>
