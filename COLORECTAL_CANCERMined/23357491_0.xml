<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Guidelines recommend a positive strategy, which is based on symptom criteria, to diagnose patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized noninferiority trial to determine whether a positive diagnostic strategy is noninferior to a strategy of exclusion, with regard to patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 302 patients (18-50 years old) from primary care who were suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> and referred by general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> with no alarm signals were randomly assigned to groups assessed by a strategy of exclusion (analyses of blood, stool samples for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal parasites</z:e>, and sigmoidoscopies with biopsies) or a positive strategy (analyses of blood cell count and C-reactive protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was difference in change of HRQOL from baseline to 1 year between groups (on the basis of the Short Form 36 health survey, physical component summary, and noninferiority margin of 3 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were change in gastrointestinal symptoms, satisfaction with management, and use of resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings of diagnostic misclassification were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive strategy was noninferior to a strategy of exclusion (difference, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, -2.74 to 1.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive diagnostic strategy had lower direct costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each approach had similar effects on symptoms, satisfaction, and subsequent use of health resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> in primary care, use of a positive diagnostic strategy is noninferior to using a strategy of exclusion with regard to the patients' HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the current guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
