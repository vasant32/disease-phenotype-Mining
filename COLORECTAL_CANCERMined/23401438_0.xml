<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE Building on previous research documenting differences in preventive care quality between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors and noncancer controls, this study examines comorbid condition care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare database, we examined comorbid condition quality of care in patients with locoregional breast, prostate, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed in 2004 who were age ≥ 66 years at diagnosis, who had survived ≥ 3 years, and who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls were frequency matched to cases on age, sex, race, and region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quality of care was assessed from day 366 through day 1,095 postdiagnosis using published indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (n = 10) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (n = 19) condition care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of eligible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors and controls who received recommended care was compared by using Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> indicators, respectively, were then combined into single logistic regression models for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type to compare survivors' care receipt to that of controls, adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic variables and controlling for within-patient variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results The sample matched 8,661 cancer survivors to 17,322 controls (mean age, 75 years; 65% male; 85% white) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors were less likely than controls to receive appropriate care on both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.95) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.85) indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate cancer</z:hpo> survivors were more likely to receive appropriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> care (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.38) but less likely to receive quality <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors received care equivalent to controls on both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.17) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.13) indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION Because we found differences by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type, research exploring factors associated with these differences in care quality is needed </plain></SENT>
