<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we analyzed SOCS3 expression in the colon of healthy controls, as well as in a cohort of UC patients with varying degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observe that the loss of epithelial SOCS3 expression delimits the areas subject to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in UC, suggesting an important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-suppressive role of SOCS3 downregulation, early in the transformation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, methylation of the SOCS3 promotor appears to constitute an important regulatory mechanism for colonic SOCS3 expression as SOCS3 methylation status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells correlates with a disability to upregulate SOCS3 upon IL-6 stimulation, whereas forced demethylation using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> restores SOCS3 expression and inhibits IL-6-induced p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the DNA methyltransferase gene DMNT1 is prominent in dysplastic cells and correlates with low or absent SOCS3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, induction of DNMT1 expression in the chronically inflamed colon may release IL-6 signaling towards signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 from inhibition through SOCS3 increasing the propensity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
