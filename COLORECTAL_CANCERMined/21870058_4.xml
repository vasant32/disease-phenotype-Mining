<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at investigating the expression and potential role of SATB1 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-three paired samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and distant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rectal tissue were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the correlations between SATB1 expression and clinicopathological parameters were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of SATB1 were also investigated in a panel of five human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The general level of SATB1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> tissues was statistically significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of positive SATB1 protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> (44.1%) was significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (25.8%) by IHC analysis (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SATB1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was more predominant in patients with earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SATB1 expression correlated with invasive depth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (TNM) stage at both protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SATB1 expression in the poorly metastatic KM12C cells was significantly lower than the highly metastatic KM12SM and KM12L4A cells and higher than the HCT116 and SW480 cells (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results were further confirmed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that SATB1 may play an important role in the progression of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, which represents a possible new mechanism underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
