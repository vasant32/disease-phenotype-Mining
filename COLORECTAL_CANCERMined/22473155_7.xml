<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The NORDIC-VII multicenter phase III trial investigated the efficacy of cetuximab when added to bolus fluorouracil/folinic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (Nordic FLOX), administered continuously or intermittently, in previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of KRAS mutation status on treatment outcome was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard Nordic FLOX (arm A), cetuximab and FLOX (arm B), or cetuximab combined with intermittent FLOX (arm C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS), response rate, R0 resection rate, and safety were secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 571 patients randomly assigned, 566 were evaluable in intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS and BRAF mutation analyses were obtained in 498 (88%) and 457 patients (81%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were present in 39% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; 12% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of BRAF mutations was a strong negative prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the ITT population, median PFS was 7.9, 8.3, and 7.3 months for the three arms, respectively (not significantly different) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OS was almost identical for the three groups (20.4, 19.7, 20.3 months, respectively), and confirmed response rates were 41%, 49%, and 47%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, cetuximab did not provide any additional benefit compared with FLOX alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with KRAS mutations, no significant difference was detected, although a trend toward improved PFS was observed in arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The regimens were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cetuximab did not add significant benefit to the Nordic FLOX regimen in first-line treatment of mCRC </plain></SENT>
