<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known regarding characteristics associated with patient adherence to physician recommendations in community and academic based primary care settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed from 975 patients, aged â‰¥50 years, recruited from 25 primary care practices in New Jersey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chi-square and generalized estimate equation analyses determined independent correlates of receipt of and adherence to physician recommendation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients reported high screening rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More than three fourths of patients reported either screening or having received a screening recommendation (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men (P = .0425), nonsmokers (P = .0029), and patients who were highly educated (P = .0311) were more likely to receive a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients more adhere to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations were older adults (P &lt; .0001), nonsmokers (P = .0005), those who were more highly educated (P = .0365), Hispanics (P = .0325), and those who were married (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Community and academic primary care clinicians appropriately recommended screening to high-risk patients with familial risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, they less frequently recommended screening to others (ie, women and smokers) also likely to benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To further increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, clinicians must systematically recommend screening to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who may benefit </plain></SENT>
