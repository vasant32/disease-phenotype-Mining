<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression profiles represent new molecular tools that are useful to characterize the successive steps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and the prediction of recurrence or chemotherapy response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have used quantitative proteomic analysis to compare different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combination of laser microdissection, OFFGEL separation, iTRAQ labeling, and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS was used to explore the proteome of 28 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two software packages were used for identification and quantification of differentially expressed proteins: Protein Pilot and iQuantitator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on ∼1,190,702 MS/MS spectra, a total of 3138 proteins were identified, which represents the largest database of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> realized to date and demonstrates the value of our quantitative proteomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this way, individual protein expression and variation have been identified for each patient and for each colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage (stages I-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 555 proteins presenting a significant fold change were quantified in the different stages, and this differential expression correlated with immunohistochemistry results reported in the Human Protein Atlas database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To identify a candidate biomarker of the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we focused our study on secreted proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this way, we identified olfactomedin-4, which was overexpressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and in early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This early stage overexpression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in 126 paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results also indicate that OLFM4 is regulated by the Ras-NF-κB2 pathway, one of the main oncogenic pathways deregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
