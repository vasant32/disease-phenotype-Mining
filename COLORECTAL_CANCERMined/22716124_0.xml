<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries age 66-75 in 2009 in Texas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The percentage of beneficiaries up to date in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in 2009 was stratified by race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multilevel models were used to study the effect of having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> characteristics on the racial and ethnic disparities on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Medicare data from 2000 to 2009 were used to assess prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Odds of undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were more than twice as high in patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> (OR = 2.05, 95 percent CI 2.03-2.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After accounting for clustering and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> characteristics, the black-white disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates almost disappears and the Hispanic-white disparity decreases substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in the elderly are mostly explained by decreased access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> and by clustering of minorities within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> less likely to screen any of their patients </plain></SENT>
