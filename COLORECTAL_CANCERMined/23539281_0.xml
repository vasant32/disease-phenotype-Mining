<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although individualized decision making is recommended to appropriately screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in older adults, it is unclear whether physicians solicit input from older patients before making a recommendation for or against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether physicians elect to engage older patients in individualized decision making for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We surveyed a random sample of 650 US primary care physicians by mail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physicians responded to questions about three clinical vignettes involving 80-year-old female patients in good, fair, and poor health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined whether physicians reported that they would initiate a discussion with the patients about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and whether they would make a recommendation about screening or seek patient input first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 276 eligible physicians responded (52 % corrected response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether physicians indicated they would initiate a discussion about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening varied by vignette: 91 % of physicians indicated they would do so for the patient in good health and 66 % and 44 % for the patients in fair and poor health, respectively (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of physicians that would seek patient input for their screening recommendation also varied by vignette (45 % for good, 49 % for fair, and 26 % for poor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that physicians often individualize their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations for older women by electing to engage patients in discussions and seeking their input before making a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physicians were more likely to elect to engage the patients represented by the good and fair health vignette, where the potential benefits likely outweigh the potential harms, than the patient in poor health, where the potential harms likely outweigh the potential benefits </plain></SENT>
