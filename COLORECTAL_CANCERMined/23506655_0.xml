<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A Chinese herbal formula, Yi-Qi-Fu-Sheng (YQFS), has long been employed clinically to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine its effectiveness as a treatment method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the therapeutic effects of YQFS on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, as well as the underlying mechanisms, which have not previously been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: First, YQFS was extracted and chemically characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then tested the effects of YQFS on proliferation and migration by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and transwell migration assays in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were established by inoculation with HCT-116 cells, and mice received one of three oral doses (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg/day) to evaluate the effects of YQFS extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) expression in mice was evaluated by gelatin zymography assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis in vitro and by TUNEL assay in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ERK and p-ERK expression were evaluated by western blot analysis at the protein level in vitro, and by quantitative RT-PCR at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results show that YQFS significantly inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell proliferation and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle arrest at the G1- and S-phase in HCT-116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, YQFS effectively retards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor cell migration</z:e> and invasion by inhibiting metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) expression, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, YQFS had an inhibitory effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in vivo, and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through the inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that YQFS extract has an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which could be attributed to ERK1/2-dependent inhibition of MMP-2/9 expression </plain></SENT>
