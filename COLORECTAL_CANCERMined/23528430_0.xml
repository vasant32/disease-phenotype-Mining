<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resistance to monoclonal antibodies specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been attributed to the presence of activating point mutations in the proto-oncogene KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of EGFR inhibitor monotherapy in patients that have KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> has produced response rates of only 10-20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for clinical resistance remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose two possible explanations to explain these low response rates; 1) levels of resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells carrying mutated KRAS are below the sensitivity of standard direct sequencing modalities (&lt;5%) or 2) the standard practice of analyzing a single area within a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is a practice that can overlook areas with mutated KRAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a collaborative effort with the surgical and molecular pathology departments, 3 formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were obtained from the human tissue bank maintained by the Lifespan Pathology Department and/or the human tissue bank maintained by the Molecular Pathology Core of the COBRE for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three specimens previously demonstrated KRAS mutations detected by the Applied Biosystems Kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Wave system 4500 (high performance ion-pairing liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC)) was utilized to evaluate tissue for the presence of KRAS proto-oncogene mutations at codons 12 and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initially, the sensitivity of WAVE technology was compared with direct sequencing by evaluating a dilutional series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WAVE detected mutant alleles at levels of 2.5% compared to 20% performed with standard direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Samples from three patients were evaluated by WAVE technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight samples from patient 1 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In two of eight samples, no mutations were detected at concentrations as low as 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In one sample a mutation was noted by WAVE and not by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four samples from patient 2 tested positive for Exon 12/13 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of the seven samples from patient 3, five were positive for Exon 12/13 mutations and two were negative for Exon 12/13 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In these studies the analysis of three patients' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues were analyzed utilizing the WAVE technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated a greater degree of sensitivity in mutation detection when compared to standard sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These studies also demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of expression of KRAS mutations between areas of the tissue samples at a genomic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The low clinical response rates to EGFR inhibition might be explained by the variation in mutation presence, which was dependent upon the region examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> demonstrated in these studies provides another phenotypic variant that will impact clinical care </plain></SENT>
