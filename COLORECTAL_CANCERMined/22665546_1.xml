<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been described as a subsequent malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (SMN), although little is known about associated risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to quantify the long-term risk of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and identify treatment-related risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this nested case-control study, 19 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon or rectum were identified from 13,048 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> at St Jude Children's Research Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 controls (n = 148) were matched for age at primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and follow-up interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 2 controls (n = 72) were matched on primary diagnosis in addition to group 1 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exact conditional logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for chemotherapy and radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-year cumulative incidence of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standardized incidence ratio was 10.9 (95% CI, 6.6 to 17.0) compared with that in the general US population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was more likely in an irradiated segment of the colon (group 1 OR, 7.7; P = .001; group 2 OR, 15.4; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk increased by 70% with each 10-Gy increase in radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing radiation volume increased risk (group 1 OR, 1.5; P &lt; .001; group 2 OR, 1.8; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">Alkylating agent</z:chebi> exposure was associated with an 8.8-fold increased risk of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In matched analyses, radiation and alkylator exposure are associated with secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This risk is proportional to dose and volume of radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surveillance should be initiated at a young age among survivors receiving high-risk exposures </plain></SENT>
