<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether reticular hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase images of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) is a diagnostic finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinusoidal obstruction syndrome</z:e> (SOS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> who have undergone chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed EOB-MRI of 42 patients who had undergone chemotherapy before hepatic resection of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists, who were unaware of whether or not the patients had SOS, reviewed the hepatobiliary phase images to determine the presence of hypointense reticulation in the liver using a 5-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (A(z)) were calculated for each reviewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and A(z) for the diagnosis of SOS were 75%, 100% and 0.957 for reader 1 and 75%, 96.2% and 0.936 for reader 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient who received a false-positive diagnosis by one reader, there was sinusoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> on histological examination, but not diagnostic for SOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>False-negative diagnosis occurred in four patients for both readers; histology of these patients showed minimal and localised sinusoidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reticular hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase images of EOB-MRI is highly specific for the diagnosis of SOS in patients with treated colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS: Gadoxetic acid enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) can identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinusoidal obstruction syndrome</z:e> (SOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis can be achieved with high specificity and good interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SOS typically demonstrates diffuse hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase images on EOB-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EOB-MRI may be falsely negative in patients with minimal degree of SOS </plain></SENT>
