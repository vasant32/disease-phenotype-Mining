<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity is typically characterized by distal and perioral cold-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo> and dysesthesias, but other uncommon symptoms might also be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this post hoc analysis of data extracted from a prospective, multicenter study was to assess the incidence of uncommon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> neurotoxicity symptoms in patients undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred chemotherapy-naïve patients (62 males, 38 females, aged 64.7 ± 8.7 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> scheduled to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-based therapy (FOLFOX-4, FOLFOX-6, and XELOX) underwent neurologic evaluation after the 1st infusion and then after 3 and 6 months of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy (after 6th or 4th and 12th or 8th cycles, respectively, according to regimen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At evaluation, patients were asked to report the presence and characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hyperexcitability symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-two patients presented typical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> neurotoxicity in the form of cold-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo> and dysesthesias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 45/82 (54.9 %) of patients, uncommon symptoms were also present; <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> (32 %), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858563" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">jaw spasm</z:e> (26 %), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002380'>fasciculations</z:hpo> (25 %), cramps (20 %), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulty in swallowing</z:e> (18 %) were more frequently reported, while voice (4 %) and visual changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> and pseudolaryngospasm (1 %) occurred rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was disclosed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> neurotoxicity and chemotherapy regimen, cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> or patients' age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity also with uncommon manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53076">OXA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity might be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> neurotoxicity, these patients should be closely monitored to avoid this dose-limiting adverse effect </plain></SENT>
