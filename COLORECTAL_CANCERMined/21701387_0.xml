<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from an Italian case-control study, including 1953 CRC cases and 4154 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for combined categories of family history and tertiles of two a posteriori dietary patterns were derived using multiple logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with individuals without family history and in the lowest tertile category of the '<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>-rich' pattern, the ORs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.19-1.61) for the group without family history and in the highest tertile, 2.89 (95% CI: 2.30-3.64) for the one with family history and in the lowest tertile, and 4.00 (95% CI: 3.03-5.27) for the one with family history and in the highest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with individuals without family history and in the highest tertile of the 'vitamins and fiber' pattern, the ORs were 1.29 (95% CI: 1.12-1.48) for the group without family history and in the lowest tertile, 2.89 (95% CI: 2.30-3.64) for the one with family history and in the highest tertile, and 3.74 (95% CI: 2.85-4.91) for the one with family history and in the lowest tertile </plain></SENT>
