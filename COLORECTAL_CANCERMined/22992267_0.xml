<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>), the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that is widely used in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, has recently been suggested to have a suppressive effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516170" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer cell growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> chemoprevention trials, in general, the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> or of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> itself is set as the study endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> would be the most reliable endpoint, use of this endpoint would be unsuitable for chemoprevention trials, because of the relatively low occurrence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the general population and the long-term observation period that it would necessitate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is an ethical problem in conducting long-term trials to determine whether a test drug might be effective or harmful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>Aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF), defined as lesions containing crypts that are larger in diameter and stain more darkly with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> crypts, are considered as a reliable surrogate biomarker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we devised a prospective randomized controlled trial as a preliminary study prior to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> chemoprevention trial to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> against colorectal ACF formation and the safety of this drug, in patients scheduled for polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial to be conducted in patients with both colorectal ACF and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> scheduled for polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients shall be recruited for the study and the number of ACF in the rectum counted at the baseline colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Then, the participants shall be allocated randomly to either one of two groups, the <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> group and the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> group shall receive oral 900-mg <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> capsules thrice daily (total daily dose, 2.7 g per day), and those in the placebo group shall receive oral placebo capsules thrice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After one month's treatment with <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>/placebo, colonoscopic examination and polypectomy will be performed to evaluate the formation of ACF, and the cell-proliferative activity and cell-apoptotic activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa and colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This is the first study proposed to explore the effect of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> against colorectal ACF formation in humans.This trial has been registered in the University hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000008172 </plain></SENT>
