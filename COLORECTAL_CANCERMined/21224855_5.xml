<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Germline allele-specific expression (ASE) of the TGFBR1 gene has been reported as a strong risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) with an odds ratio close to 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering the potential implications of the finding, we undertook the task of validating the initial results in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Allele-specific expression was measured using the highly quantitative and robust technique of pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals from two different populations were studied, one Caucasian-dominated and the other of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with different sources of non-tumoral genetic material in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed no statistically significant differences in the degree of ASE between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and controls, considering ASE as either a quantitative or a binary trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using defined cutoff values to categorise ASE, 1.0% of blood lymphocytes from informative Israeli cases (total n=96) were ASE positive (median 1.00; range 0.76-1.31) and 2.2% of informative matched controls (total n=90) were ASE positive (median 1.00; range 0.76-1.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosae from Spanish patients (median 1.03; range: 0.68-1.43; n=75) did not show significant differences in the degree of ASE when compared with the Israeli patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that ASE of TGFBR1 does not confer an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
