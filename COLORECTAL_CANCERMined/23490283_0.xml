<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies aimed at predicting individual responsiveness to preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1559154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chemoradiation</z:e> therapy (CRT) are urgently needed, especially considering the risks associated with poorly responsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 3-step strategy for the determination of CRT sensitivity is proposed based on (1) the screening of a human genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in correlation with histopathologic <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grade (TRG); (2) clinical association analysis of 113 patients treated with preoperative CRT; and (3) a cell-based functional assay for biological validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genome-wide screening identified 9 SNPs associated with preoperative CRT responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive responses (TRG 1-3) were obtained more frequently in patients carrying the reference allele (C) of the SNP CORO2A rs1985859 than in those with the substitution allele (T) (P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of CORO2A was significantly associated with reduced early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by 27% (P=.048) and 39% (P=.023) in RKO and COLO320DM <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, respectively, as determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced radiosensitivity was confirmed by colony-forming assays in the 2 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells (P=.034 and .015, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SNP FAM101A rs7955740 was not associated with radiosensitivity in the clinical association analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, downregulation of FAM101A significantly reduced early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by 29% in RKO cells (P=.047), and it enhanced colony formation in RKO cells (P=.001) and COLO320DM cells (P=.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CRT-sensitive SNP markers were identified using a novel 3-step process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The candidate marker CORO2A rs1985859 and the putative marker FAM101A rs7955740 may be of value for the prediction of radiosensitivity to preoperative CRT, although further validation is needed in large cohorts </plain></SENT>
