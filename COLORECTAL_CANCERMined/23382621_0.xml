<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosing colorectal has been increasingly successful due to advances in technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flexible endoscopy is considered to be an effective method for early diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e>, making it a popular choice for screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, millions of people who may benefit from endoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening fail to have the procedure performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main reasons include psychological barriers due to the indignity of the procedure, fear of procedure related pain, bowel preparation discomfort, and potential need for sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an urgent need for new technologies addressing these issues clearly exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss a set of advanced endoscopic technologies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening that are either already available or close to clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, we focus on visual-inspection-only advanced flexible colonoscopes, interventional colonoscopes with alternative propulsion mechanisms, wireless capsule colonoscopy, and technologies for intraprocedural bowel cleansing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many of these devices have the potential to reduce exam related patient discomfort, obviate the need for sedation, increase diagnostic yield, reduce learning curves, improve access to screening, and possibly avert the need for a bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
