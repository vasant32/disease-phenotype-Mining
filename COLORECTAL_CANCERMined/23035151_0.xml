<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In early <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, the decision to administer chemotherapy is largely based on prognostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combined molecular/clinical EndoPredict test (EPclin) has been validated to accurately assess prognosis in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the clinical relevance of EPclin in relation to well-established clinical guidelines is assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assigned risk groups to 1702 ER-positive/HER2-negative postmenopausal women from two large phase III trials treated only with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was assigned according to National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Network-, German S3-, St Gallen guidelines and the EPclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prognostic groups were compared using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 10 years, absolute risk reductions (ARR) between the high- and low-risk groups ranged from 6.9% to 11.2% if assigned according to guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was at 18.7% for EPclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EPclin reassigned 58%-61% of women classified as high-/intermediate-risk (according to clinical guidelines) to low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women reclassified to low risk showed a 5% rate of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The EPclin score is able to predict favorable prognosis in a majority of patients that clinical guidelines would assign to intermediate or high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EPclin may reduce the indications for chemotherapy in ER-positive postmenopausal women with a limited number of clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
