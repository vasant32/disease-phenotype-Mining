<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is one of the most studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> because of its high prevalence and number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current pharmaceutical design of more efficient anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> drugs, the use of methodologies based on Chemoinformatics has played a decisive role, including Quantitative-Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, until now, there is no methodology able to predict anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> activity of compounds against more than one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line, which should constitute the principal goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to overcome this problem we develop here the first multi-target (mt) approach for the virtual screening and rational in silico discovery of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> agents against ten cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, two mt-QSAR classification models were constructed using a large and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> database of compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first model was based on linear discriminant analysis (mt-QSAR-LDA) employing fragment-based descriptors while the second model was obtained using artificial neural networks (mt-QSAR-ANN) with global 2D descriptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both models correctly classified more than 90% of active and inactive compounds in training and prediction sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some fragments were extracted from the molecules and their contributions to anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> activity were calculated using mt-QSAR-LDA model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several fragments were identified as potential substructural features responsible for the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> activity and new molecules designed from those fragments with positive contributions were suggested and correctly predicted by the two models as possible potent and versatile anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> agents </plain></SENT>
