<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this comparative observational study, two prospective cohorts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first cohort was obtained from 10 322 average risk subjects invited for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening with FIT, of which, only subjects with a positive FIT were referred for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second cohort was obtained from 3637 subjects scheduled for elective colonoscopy with a positive FIT result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same FIT and positivity threshold (OC sensor; ≥ 50 ng/mL) was used in both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> referral subjects and in FIT positive screening subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases were selected from both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome measurements were mean FIT results and FIT scores per tissue <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage (T stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were included in the present study: 28 cases obtained from the screening cohort (64% male; mean age 65 years, SD 6.5) and 90 cases obtained from the referral cohort (58% male; mean age 69 years, SD 9.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean FIT results found were higher in the referral cohort (829 ± 302 ng/mL vs 613 ± 368 ng/mL, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage (T stage) distribution was different between both populations [screening population: 13 (46%) T1, eight (29%) T2, six (21%) T3, one (4%) T4 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; referral population: 12 (13%) T1, 22 (24%) T2, 52 (58%) T3, four (4%) T4 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>], and higher T stage was significantly associated with higher FIT results (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, no significant difference in mean FIT results was observed (screening vs referral: T1 498 ± 382 ng/mL vs 725 ± 374 ng/mL, P = 0.22; T2 787 ± 303 ng/mL vs 794 ± 341 ng/mL, P = 0.79; T3 563 ± 368 ng/mL vs 870 ± 258 ng/mL, P = 0.13; T4 not available) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After correction for T stage in logistic regression analysis, no significant differences in mean FIT results were observed between both types of cohorts (P = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differences in T stage distribution largely explain differences in FIT results between screening and referral cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, FIT results should be reported according to T stage </plain></SENT>
