<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Binding of Wnt to receptors and co-receptors causes inactivation of the β-catenin destruction complex, which leads to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin to initiate Wnt-responsive gene expression after associating with TCF in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As its deregulation results in serious human diseases, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the Wnt signaling pathway serves as a promising platform for screening anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi> was selected based on its ability to inhibit the β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">Resveratrol</z:chebi>, a natural <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26115">phytoalexin</z:chebi> found in a variety of plants, possesses health-promoting properties including anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, cardioprotective and neuroprotective activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> indeed exhibited dose-dependent suppression of Wnt signaling, reduced the expression of Wnt target genes such as cyclin D1 and conductin, and inhibited the growth of Wnt-stimulated cells and Wnt-driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> functions downstream of GSK3β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> did not alter the amount of β-catenin and its distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> did not affect the accumulation and nuclear targeting of β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding analyses substantiated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> was capable of disrupting the binding between β-catenin and TCF4, contributing to the decreased Wnt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our discoveries not only reveal a novel target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> in the Wnt signaling pathway but also show the potential of therapy with harmless <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and other Wnt-related diseases </plain></SENT>
