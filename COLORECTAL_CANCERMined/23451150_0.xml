<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, we report the first detection of elevated PLA2 activities in plasma from patients with colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancers</z:e> as compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Independent sets of clinical plasma samples were obtained from two different sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first set was from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; n = 38) and healthy controls (n = 77) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PLA2 activities were analyzed by a validated quantitative fluorescent assay method and subtype PLA2 activities were defined in the presence of selective inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The natural PLA2 activity, as well as each subtype of PLA2 activity was elevated in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> group as compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PLA2 activities were increased in late stage vs. early stage cases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PLA2 activities were not influenced by sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, or body-mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Samples from the two independent sites confirmed the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma PLA2 activities had approximately 70% specificity and sensitivity to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The marker and targeting values of PLA2 activity have been suggested </plain></SENT>
