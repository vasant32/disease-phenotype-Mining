<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PC appears resistant to traditional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy, and surgery was formerly reserved for palliative purposes only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of effective treatment, the historical prognosis for these patients was extremely poor, with an invariably fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These poor outcomes likely explain why PC secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has received little attention from oncologic researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, data are lacking regarding incidence, clinical disease course, and accurate treatment evaluation for patients with PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, population-based studies have revealed that PC occurs relatively frequently among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for developing PC have been identified: right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, advanced T-stage, advanced N-stage, poor differentiation grade, and younger age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the past decade, both chemotherapeutical and surgical treatments have achieved promising results in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A chance for long-term survival or even cure may now be offered to selected patients by combining radical surgical resection with intraperitoneal instillation of heated chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This combined procedure has become known as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This editorial outlines recent advancements in the medical and surgical treatment of PC and reviews the most recent information on incidence and prognosis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given recent progress, treatment should now be considered in every patient presenting with PC </plain></SENT>
