<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to date little is known about the oncogenic mechanisms of CAFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify the microenvironmental factors involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and progression directed by CAFs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples collected from 20 patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological and morphological characterization of the samples was performed using hybridization and immunohistological assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was measured by northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, co-expression of Thy-1 (CD90) and α-SMA was identified in CAFs, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver samples were negative for α-SMA and Thy-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) incubation, the expression of α-SMA increased significantly following transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) incubation (P&lt;0.05), while platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) caused a significant suppression of α-SMA expression (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 expression was significantly lower in unstimulated fibroblasts compared to TGF-1-treated fibroblasts (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of PAI-1 transcription were significantly higher in CAFs from the patient samples compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings suggest that CAFs may be important in migration, matrix degradation, invasion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and TGF-1 may promote the activation of PAI-1 transcription in CAFs </plain></SENT>
