<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 and VEGFR2 extracellular domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the safety and efficacy of aflibercept in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCRC) who had received at least one prior palliative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventy-five patients were enrolled onto this two-stage phase II trial in two cohorts, bevacizumab naïve (n = 24) and prior bevacizumab (n = 51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aflibercept was administered at 4 mg/kg i.v. in two-week cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was a combination of objective response rate and 16-week progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the bevacizumab-naïve cohort (n = 24), the best response was stable disease for 16 weeks or more in five of 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the prior bevacizumab cohort (n = 50), one patient achieved a partial response and six patients had stable disease for 16 weeks or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median PFS in the bevacizumab-naïve and prior bevacizumab cohorts was two months [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-8.6 months] and 2.4 months (95% CI: 1.9-3.7 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) was 10.4 months (95% CI: 7.6-15.5) and 8.5 months (95% CI: 6.2-10.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients discontinued study treatment due to toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean free to VEGF-bound aflibercept ratio was 1.82, suggesting that free aflibercept was present in sufficient amount to bind endogenous VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aflibercept showed limited single-agent activity in patients with pretreated MCRC with moderate toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study of aflibercept with chemotherapy is ongoing </plain></SENT>
