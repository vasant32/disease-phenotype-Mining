<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> screening on smoking behavior is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this ancillary study of the Prostate Lung Colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Ovarian Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial were to produce risk prediction models to identify individuals at risk of relapse or continued smoking and to evaluate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-screening variables affect long-term smoking outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants completed a baseline questionnaire at trial enrollment and a supplemental questionnaire 4-14 years after enrollment, which assessed several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related variables, including family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, comorbidities, and tobacco use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict smoking status at completion of the supplemental questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The models' predictive performances were evaluated by assessing discrimination via the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) and calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Models were internally validated using bootstrap methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 31&amp;emsp14;694 former smokers on the baseline questionnaire, 1042 (3.3%) had relapsed (ie, reported being a current smoker on the supplemental questionnaire) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 6807 current smokers on the baseline questionnaire, 4439 (65.2%) reported continued smoking on the supplemental questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapse was associated with multiple demographic, medical, and tobacco-related characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model had a bootstrap median ROC AUC of 0.862 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.858 to 0.866) and a calibration slope of 1.004 (95% CI = 0.978 to 1.029), indicating excellent discrimination and calibration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors of continued smoking also included multiple demographic, medical, and tobacco-related characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This model had an ROC AUC of 0.611 (95% CI = 0.605 to 0.614) and a slope of 1.006 (95% CI = 0.962 to 1.041), indicating modest discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither the trial arm nor the lung-screening result was statistically significantly associated with smoking outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These models, if validated externally, may have public health utility in identifying individuals at risk for adverse smoking outcomes, who may benefit from relapse prevention and smoking cessation interventions </plain></SENT>
