<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: (1) Experiment: The temperature of the 5%<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> injection solution was measured at the leading edge of the infusion route when it was heated to 36°Cor 40°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) CASES: Among five patients receving XELOX therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, we examined the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular pain</z:e> by heating the L-OHP solution to 40°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Experiment: The injection temperatures were reduced to 25°C and 31°C while passing through the infusion route when L-OHP solution was heated to 36°C and 40°C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) CASE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular pain</z:e> did not occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients treated with XELOX therapy completely by heating the L-OHP solution at 40°C, including two patients who could not continue treatment caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular pain</z:e> without the heating method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The method using the heat infusion route of L-OHP at 40°C is useful for reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular pain</z:e> from L-OHP administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
