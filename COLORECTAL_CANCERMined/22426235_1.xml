<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Missense variants discovered during sequencing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility genes can be problematic for clinical interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MLH1 K618A, which results from a 2-bp alteration (AAGâ†’GCG) leading to a substitution of lysine to alanine in codon 618, has variously been interpreted as a pathogenic mutation, a variant of unknown significance, and a benign polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of MLH1 K618A in predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> by genotyping 1512 control subjects to assess its frequency in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed the literature concerning MLH1 K618A in families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measured allele frequency of the K618A variant was 0.40%, which is remarkably close to the 0.44% summarized from 2491 control subjects in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>K618A was over-represented in families with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1366 families, the allele frequency was 0.88% (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.5; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the type associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, K618A was over-represented in 1742 cases (allele frequency of 0.83) (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.2; P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MLH1 K618A is not a fully penetrant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> mutation, although it is not without effect, appearing to increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> approximately twofold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our systematic assessment approach may be useful for variants in other genes </plain></SENT>
