<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the association of two genetic polymorphisms in XRCC1 (rs1799782 and rs25487) with risk of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> study of Austria (CORSA), a total of 3091 Caucasian participants was genotyped using 5'-nuclease TaqMan assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was applied to compare individuals of the control group against three different case groups namely <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, high-risk and low-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two investigated SNPs in XRCC1 were not found to be associated with neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases versus the controls the OR was 0.60 (95%CI 0.27-1.31) for the heterozygous polymorphic genotype of SNP rs1799782 and 1.47 (95%CI 0.81-2.65) for the homozygous polymorphic genotype of SNP rs25487 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> group versus the controls the OR was 2.64 (95%CI 0.61-11.42) for the homozygous polymorphic genotype of SNP rs1799782 and 0.89 (95%CI 0.60-1.33) for SNP rs25487, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an haplotype analysis also no statistically significant association was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our finding that none of the two investigated SNPs of XRCC1 were significantly associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> is consistent with the results of a recently published meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
