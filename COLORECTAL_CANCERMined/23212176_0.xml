<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, research into the clinical utility of MMR IHC for this indication is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective chart review of 90 patients with MMR IHC completed on at least one SN from January 2005 to May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SNs included were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007097" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epitheliomas</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and basal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> with sebaceous differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 90 patients, 13 (14 %) had genetically confirmed or fulfilled clinical criteria for a diagnosis of MTS and 51 patients (57 %) presented with an <z:mp ids='MP_0009797'>abnormal MMR</z:mp> IHC result (loss of one or more MMR proteins) on at least one SN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal IHC had a sensitivity of 85 %, specificity of 48 %, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 22 % and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95 % when evaluating for MTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When personal or family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (≥2 family members with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) was taken into consideration, ignoring IHC results, sensitivity was 92 %, specificity was 99 %, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was 92 % and NPV was 99 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMR IHC on SNs when used to screen for MTS has poor diagnostic utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend that MMR IHC not be performed routinely on SNs when the patient does not have either personal or family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
