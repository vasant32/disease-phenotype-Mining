<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: According to the American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (AJCC) 7th edition, T4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> have been sub-divided into T4a and T4b, resulting in a stage II sub-classification (T3N0, T4aN0, and T4bN0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed: (a) to investigate the impact of the AJCC 7th edition stage II sub-classification on the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients who underwent surgical resection and (b) to compare the last three AJCC editions for identifying stage II patients with high-risk of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy-eight stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> out of 682 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who underwent surgical resection were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T4N0 were sub-divided in accordance with the AJCC 7th edition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 41.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier method was employed to estimate the survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OS analysis documented a significant difference between stage-sub-groups using the 6th edition; conversely, this difference was not seen if the 7th edition was applied (p = 0.03 and 0.12, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stage II DFS analysis reported a significant difference using both the AJCC 6th and 7th editions (p = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was reported on stage II DSS analysis using the AJCC 6th edition (p = 0.03); however, when the 7th edition was applied, a substantial discrepancy between survival curves was noted with T3N0 and T4aN0 displaying similar outcomes (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AJCC 7th edition is a reliable classification that might implement the identification of those stage II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients with high-risk of progression, recurrence, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
