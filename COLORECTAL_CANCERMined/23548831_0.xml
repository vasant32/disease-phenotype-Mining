<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the safety of bevacizumab in Chinese patients, a safety study was conducted in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Bevacizumab was provided by the Expanded Access Program in combination with first-line chemotherapy per investigator's choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary objective is the safety profile, particularly the targeted adverse events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, wound healing complication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second objectives include time to disease progression and overall survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with major surgical procedure performed within the 28 days of bevacizumab were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Forty patients were eligible for intent-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of objective response and disease control was 55.2 and 81.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to disease progression and overall survival were 11.9 and 22.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 2-year survival was 46.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding toxicity, 7 subjects (17.5%) had serious adverse effects related to study treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in this cohort had arterial thrombotic events and bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Bevacizumab demonstrates a similar activity and safety profile in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Life-threatening bowel complications were avoided in this study by excluding patients with major surgery within the first 28 days </plain></SENT>
