<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>History and admission findings: A 59-year-old man was admitted with an acral <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the left 3rd finger, which had developed during several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patient complained of diarrhoea.Investigations: Acral light plethysmography showed critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of digitus II and V, and impaired distal perfusion of digitus I and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex sonography revealed atherosclerotic plaques in the supraaortal vessels with stenosis of the left axillary artery which was confirmed by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no differences in the pressure of ulnar and radial arteries existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy and abdominal computed tomography revealed two colon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e>.Treatment and course: The stenosis of the left axillary artery was considered as the source of distal embolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after morphologically successful angioplasty distal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> worsened with involvement of additional fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Later in the course, diagnostic work-up of diarrhoa established the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the patient died because of intercurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>.Conclusion: Spontaneous acral <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> may develop due to embolisation or local thrombotic vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression despite successful treatment of a potential source of embolism points to a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
