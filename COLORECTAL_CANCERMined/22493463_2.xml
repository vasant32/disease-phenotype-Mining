<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening strategies can reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality, screening rates remain low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether the approach by which screening is recommended influences adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a cluster randomization design with clinic time block as the unit of randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persons at average risk for development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a racially/ethnically diverse urban setting were randomized to receive recommendation for screening by fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), colonoscopy, or their choice of FOBT or colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was completion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening within 12 months after enrollment, defined as performance of colonoscopy, or 3 FOBT cards plus colonoscopy for any positive FOBT result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary analyses evaluated sociodemographic factors associated with completion of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 997 participants were enrolled; 58% completed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening strategy they were assigned or chose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, participants who were recommended colonoscopy completed screening at a significantly lower rate (38%) than participants who were recommended FOBT (67%) (P &lt; .001) or given a choice between FOBT or colonoscopy (69%) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Latinos and Asians (primarily Chinese) completed screening more often than African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, nonwhite participants adhered more often to FOBT, while white participants adhered more often to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The common practice of universally recommending colonoscopy may reduce adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, especially among racial/ethnic minorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant variation in overall and strategy-specific adherence exists between racial/ethnic groups; however, this may be a proxy for health beliefs and/or language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that patient preferences should be considered when making <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Trial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00705731 </plain></SENT>
