<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Societal preference-weighted health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores enable comparing multidimensional health states across diseases and treatments for research and policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of living with a permanent intestinal stoma, compared with a major bowel resection, among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional multivariate linear regression analysis to explain preference-weighted HRQOL scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 640 CRC survivors (≥ 5 years) from 3 group model health maintenance organizations; ostomates and nonostomates with colorectal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were matched on gender, age (± 5 years), time since diagnosis, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site (rectum vs. colon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: SF-6D scoring system was applied to Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2); City of Hope Quality of Life-Ostomy; and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors linked to respondents' clinical data extracted from health maintenance organization files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rate was 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ostomates and nonostomates had similar sociodemographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean SF-6D score was 0.69 for ostomates, compared with 0.73 for nonostomates (P &lt; 0.001), but other factors explained this difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications of initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery, and previous year comorbidity burden, and hospital use were negatively associated with SF-6D scores, whereas household income was positively associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors' SF-6D scores were not associated with living with a permanent ostomy after other factors were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications, comorbidities, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> lowered the preference-weighted HRQOL of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors with and without ostomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research to understand and reduce late complications from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> surgeries as well as associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
