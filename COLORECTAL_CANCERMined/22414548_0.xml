<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of patients with stage T3N0 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, operated between 1997-2003 and the surgical materials for the relation between disease prognosis and p53, p21, p16, β-catenin, E-cadherin, EGFR, hMLH1, hMSH2 and TS protein expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly shorter 3-year disease free survival was observed in patients under the age of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The worst 5-year overall survival (OS) observed for patients over 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> localization and number of processed lymph nodes significantly affected prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EGFR, hMSH2 and TS expressions and the 5-fluorouracyl treatment were not found to be of prognostic value; p53 and p21 positivity had significantly worse survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When β-catenin membrane expression disappeared on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, the 5-year OS rate decreased and time to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> shortened significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Membrane β-catenin expression, processed lymph nodes number and age were detected as independent prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the evaluation of a clinicopathological profile, based on age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization, number of examined lymph nodes, p53, p21 and E-cadherin β-catenin expression appears to be useful in identifying high risk patients </plain></SENT>
