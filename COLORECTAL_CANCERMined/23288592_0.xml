<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine the introduction of laparoscopic surgery in the English National Health Service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were extracted from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data Repository on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent major resection for a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between 2006 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic procedures were identified from codes in the Hospital Episode Statistics and National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Audit Project data in the resource </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trends in the use of laparoscopic surgery and its influence on outcomes were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 58 135 resections undertaken over the study period, 10 955 (18·8 per cent) were attempted laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increased from 10·0 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 8·1 to 12·0) per cent in 2006 to 28·4 (25·4 to 31·4) per cent in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic surgery was used less in patients with advanced disease (modified Dukes' stage 'D' versus A: odds ratio (OR) 0·45, 95 per cent c.i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>0·40 to 0·50), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumours</z:e> (OR 0·71, 0·67 to 0·75), those with more co-morbidity (Charlson score 3 or more versus 0: OR 0·69, 0·58 to 0·82) or presenting as an emergency (OR 0·15, 0·13 to 0·17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 1652 laparoscopic procedures (15·1 per cent) were converted to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversion was more likely in advanced disease (modified Dukes' stage 'D' versus A: OR 1·56, 1·20 to 2·03), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumours</z:e> (OR 1·29, 1·14 to 1·46) and emergencies (OR 2·06, 1·54 to 2·76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Length of hospital stay (OR 0·65, 0·64 to 0·66), 30-day postoperative mortality (OR 0·55, 0·48 to 0·64) and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 1 year (hazard ratio 0·60, 0·55 to 0·65) were reduced in the laparoscopic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery was used more frequently in low-risk patients </plain></SENT>
