<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations of dietary intakes of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamins with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in 816 incident cases of histologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 815 controls randomly selected for the Fukuoka <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> study in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary intakes were assessed by a PC-assisted interview regarding 148 food items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical adjustment was made for body mass index, physical activity, calcium, and n-3 fatty acid intake and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">Retinol</z:chebi> intake was significantly, inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk; the odds ratio for the highest vs. lowest was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.88; P (trend) = 0.01) in women, but a modest increase in the risk was observed among men with the highest intake of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liver was the major source of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> intake and showed similar associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in men and women </plain></SENT>
