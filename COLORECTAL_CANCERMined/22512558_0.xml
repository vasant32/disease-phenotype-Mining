<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current chemotherapy regimens comprise a group of chemotherapeutic agents in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> is included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> and cardiotoxicity are limiting factors for its usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liposomal formulations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> improve its anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effects but are still insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The research in this area has lead to the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> analogues, such as ladirubicin, the leading compound of alkylcyclines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This new anticancer agent has shown promising results in vivo and in vitro, being effective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> cell lines, including those with a multidrug resistant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In phase I clinical trials, this molecule caused mild side effects and did not induce significant cardiotoxicity at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg/m(2), resulting in a peak plasma concentration (C(max)) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 Î¼M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recommended doses for phase II studies were 12 and 14 mg/m(2) in heavily and minimally pretreated/non-pretreated patients, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the improved molecular targeting efficacy of these new compounds, ongoing approaches have sought to improve drug delivery systems, to improve treatment efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of these two approaches may be a good start for the discovery of new treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
