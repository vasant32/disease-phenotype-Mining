<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for LRP16 was performed in 201 cases of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 60 cases of distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed and clinicopathological analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LRP16 expression was detected in 117 of 201 cases of the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and in 21 cases of 60 distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of LRP16 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (chi(2) = 9.999, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LRP16 protein expression was found in 43.3% (52/120) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at stage I and II, and 80.2% (65/81) of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> at stage III and IV (chi(2) =27.088, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation between LRP16 expression and clinicopathological factors was significant in differentiation (P = 0.010), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (P = 0.001), infiltrative depth (P = 0.000) and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference of median survival time between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with LRP16 expression (38.0 mo) and those without was statistically significant (105.0 mo, Log rank = 41.455, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate survival analysis revealed that LRP16 expression was correlated significantly (Cox's regression: P = 0.001, relative risk = 2.082) with shortened survival in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of LRP16 is related to the degree of differentiation, invasiveness, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and prognosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
