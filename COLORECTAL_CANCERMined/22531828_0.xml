<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the determinants of initial F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG)-PET indication following primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis among patients who underwent surgery between January 2000 and December 2007 and who were observed at a single institution for at least 2 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 530 patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection, 113 patients received at least one F-FDG-PET following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome variables included indication and time of the first F-FDG-PET following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential predictors included disease-level and patient-level characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients diagnosed later in the study period and patients with higher-stage disease were more likely to receive their first F-FDG-PET for initial staging (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.016, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower-stage disease were more likely to receive their initial F-FDG-PET for suspected recurrence on conventional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When performed more than 2 years after diagnosis, F-FDG-PET was more likely to be ordered for suspected recurrence either on the basis of conventional imaging or on the basis of patient symptoms/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers (P=0.003 and 0.031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>F-FDG-PET demonstrated disease progression in at least 50% of patients referred for each indication (P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher utilization of F-FDG-PET may be appropriate among patients referred for a number of indications including: initial staging, particularly among those with higher-stage disease; suspected recurrence on conventional imaging among patients with lower-stage disease; and suspected recurrence more than 2 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to verify these findings </plain></SENT>
