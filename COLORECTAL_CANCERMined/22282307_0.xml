<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>KRAS status assessment is mandatory in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> before therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies, as KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, KRAS genotyping may be very challenging in case of poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cellularity, particularly when major <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> is achieved in locally advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinomas</z:mp> after radiochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at identifying the most reliable strategy to detect KRAS mutations in such samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from 31 surgical specimens with major <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp>, following manual dissection, and from paired pre-treatment biopsies and analyzed by high-resolution melting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA samples displaying altered melting curve shapes were then sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples with unmodified melting curves or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> sequence were further investigated by using an allele-specific PCR assay (TheraScreen) and laser microdissection (followed by high-resolution melting and sequencing analyses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 31 post-radiochemotherapy surgical specimens, seven KRAS mutations were identified by high-resolution melting analysis/sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One additional mutation was detected by the TheraScreen assay and two mutations, including the one identified by the TheraScreen assay, were detected following laser microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 9/31 surgical specimens (29%) presented KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the manually dissected pre-treatment biopsies, 12 mutations (39%) were identified by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No additional mutations were found by using the TheraScreen assay or laser microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, in the case of post-radiochemotherapy surgical specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cellularity, pre-treatment biopsies might represent the most cost-effective option for reliable KRAS genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of more sensitive assays, such as allele-specific PCR or laser microdissection, can be envisaged but with higher costs and longer delays </plain></SENT>
