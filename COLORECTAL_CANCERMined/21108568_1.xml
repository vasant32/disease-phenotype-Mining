<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to date, no studies have reported such rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, who derive a survival advantage with this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study examined the incidence of bevacizumab-induced, clinically symptomatic, otolaryngology specialist-confirmed nasal septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> among 100 patients who had been consecutively-treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of nasal septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was 1% (95% confidence intervals: -0.95% to 2.95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This single adverse event was successfully managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the whole group, 94 had been treated with bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg every two weeks, except for four patients treated at higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of bevacizumab doses (range) was seven (1-96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitant chemotherapy had been prescribed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin, as per one of the FOLFOX regimens (44 patients); irinotecan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, leucovorin, as per the FOLFIRI regimen (13 patients); both these regimens and no other (five patients); or a different regimen (38 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nasal septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> from bevacizumab occurs infrequently among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
