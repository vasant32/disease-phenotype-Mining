<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine whether <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and related hormones are associated with incident prostate, lung, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi>-binding globulin (SHBG), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured between 2001 and 2004 in 3,635 community-dwelling men aged 70 to 88 years (mean 77 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> notifications were obtained via electronic record linkage until December 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 6.7 Â± 1.8 years, there were 297, 104, and 82 cases of prostate, colorectal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In adjusted competing risks proportional hazards models, each one SD increase in free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was associated with a 9% increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.18), but other hormones were not significantly associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were observed between hormonal parameters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher total <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the mean of 15 nmol/L, men with levels of 20 nmol/L were 1.38 times more likely to be cases (95% CI, 1.21-1.57), whereas those with levels of 30 nmol/L were 3.62 times more likely to be cases (95% CI, 2.53-5.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, though SHBG and LH were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Associations were maintained after exclusion of current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher free <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was associated with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels may also be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Further studies should investigate whether these risks apply to men receiving <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
