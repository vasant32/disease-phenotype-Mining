<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the sequential development of ACF and MDF histopathologically in the colon of rats from 5 to 40 weeks after DMH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The numbers of ACF per colon increased over time during the experiment, and were much higher than the number in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, while the number of MDF per colon remained unchanged from the early stage (the 5th week after carcinogen exposure), and approximate to those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ACF, which was much higher than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, also increased gradually in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of MDF, however, was similar to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and did not change significantly during the whole experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No lesion as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with high-grade (DHG) or <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (AC) were found in any large ACF from the 5th to 40th week histopathologically, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the large MDF showed DHG or AC features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even at 5 weeks, MDF showed features of DHG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We classified these into two forms of MDF: flat and protruded MDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 40 weeks, the number of flat MDF per colon decreased significantly compared with that at 20 weeks (p&lt;0.05), however, the number of protruded MDF per colon increased (p&lt;0.01), and the percentage of DHG in a protruded MDF lesion decreased but that of AC increased remarkably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MDF may develop into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> through the so-called 'deÂ novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>' pathway </plain></SENT>
