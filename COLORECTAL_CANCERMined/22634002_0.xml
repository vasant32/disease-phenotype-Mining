<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we investigated the role of myofibroblasts in the upregulation of S100A8/A9 as well as in the differentiation of myeloid cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the interactions among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, myofibroblasts, and inflammatory cells in the microenvironment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we used 10 CRC cell lines, 18CO cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells, which were co-cultured with each other or cultured in conditioned media (CM) of other cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of S100A8/A9 was evaluated via Western blot, immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secreted factors from the cell lines were analyzed using cytokine antibody array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry analysis was performed to analyze the differentiation markers of myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 18CO CM induced increased expression of S100A8/A9 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of S100A8/A9 was noted in inflammatory cells of the peri- and intra-tumoral areas, along with myofibroblasts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>S100A8/A9-expressing inflammatory cells also exhibited CD68 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissue, and 18CO CM induced differentiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells into myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) or M2 macrophages expressing S100A8/A9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant amounts of IL-6 and IL-8 were detected in 18CO CM, compared to those in both controls and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 CM, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrated myofibroblasts expressed IL-8 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 and IL-8 attenuated 18CO CM-induced increased expression of S100A8/A9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of S100A8/A9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrated myeloid cells could be triggered by IL-6 and IL-8 released from myofibroblasts, and myofibroblasts might induce the differentiation of myeloid cells into S100A8/9-expressing MDSCs or M2 macrophages in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
