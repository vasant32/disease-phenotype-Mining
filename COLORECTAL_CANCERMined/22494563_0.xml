<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to identify new prognostic factors in patients with PC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with PC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated by HIPEC from January 2000 to December 2007 were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extension was assessed by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153467" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Peritoneal Cancer</z:e> Index (PCI) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> was recorded using the completeness cytoreductive score (CCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical and treatment data were computed in univariate and multivariable analyses using survival as primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We carried out 51 complete procedures in 49 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean PCI was 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allocation of CCs was: CC-0 = 37, CC-1 = 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The five-year overall and progression-free survival rate were 40% and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several prognostic factors for survival were identified by univariate analysis: PCI &lt; 9 (P &lt; 0.001), CC-0 vs. CC-1 (P &lt; 0.01) and involvement of area 4 (P = 0.06), area 5 (P = 0.031), area 7 (P = 0.014), area 8 (P = 0.022), area 10 (P &lt; 0.0001), and area 11 (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only the involvement of the distal jejunum (area 10) was significant in the multivariable analysis (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the involvement of area 10 (distal jejunum of the PCI score) was an independent factor associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
