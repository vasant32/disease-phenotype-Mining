<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CLM), the presence of concomitant perihepatic/para-aortic lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (LNM) is considered a contraindication to liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the benefits of liver resection among patients with CLM + LNM by examining long-term outcomes among a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 1996 and December 2007, 61 patients with CLM and pathologically proven LNM were identified from an international multi-institutional database of 1629 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of LNM, as well as other prognostic factors, on recurrence-free and overall survival was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median overall survival was 32 months, and 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival were 86, 35, and 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients were alive and disease-free at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was associated with location of LNM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, 5-year overall survival was 30% among patients with LNM along the hepatoduodenal ligament/retropancreatic area (area 1), 14% among patients with LNM along the common hepatic artery/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> axis (area 2), and there was only one long-term survivor who experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> among patients who had CLM + para-aortic LNM (area 3) (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analyses, overall margin status (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.0), treated number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> &gt;6 (HR = 2.3) and para-aortic lymph node involvement (HR = 2.6) each remained significantly associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although overall survival in the setting of LNM is only 18%, certain subsets of patients with LNM can benefit from surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specifically, patients with CLM + LNM isolated to area 1 had a 5-year survival of approximately 30%, while long-term survival among patients with para-aortic LNM was rare </plain></SENT>
