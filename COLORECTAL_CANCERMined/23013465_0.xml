<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive MEDLINE and American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> abstract search was performed to gather <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant clinical and translational data related to tivozanib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss pre-clinical studies associated with tivozanib, and the results of a Phase I assessment in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We highlight combination studies with tivozanib, including pairings of tivozanib with cytotoxic therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A randomized discontinuation Phase II study and a randomized Phase III study assessing the activity of tivozanib in metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (mRCC) are described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: Tivozanib will face the challenge of entering an already crowded therapeutic space in mRCC-emerging combination studies and biomarker assessments may distinguish this agent among other VEGF-TKIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current review will outline the development pathway of tivozanib to date, and offer lessons learned and future opportunities </plain></SENT>
