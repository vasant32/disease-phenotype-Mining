<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGFA antibody, inhibits the developing vasculature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but resistance is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antiangiogenic therapy induces <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and we observed increased expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-regulated genes, including carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), in response to bevacizumab treatment in xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAIX expression correlates with poor prognosis in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types and with worse outcome in bevacizumab-treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo>, and recurrent malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We knocked down CAIX expression by short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (HT29) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> (U87) cell line which have high hypoxic induction of CAIX and overexpressed CAIX in HCT116 cells which has low CAIX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect on growth rate in three-dimensional (3D) culture and in vivo, and examined the effect of CAIX knockdown in combination with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAIX expression was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002865'>increased growth rate</z:mp> in spheroids and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, CAIX expression was associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that acidity inhibits CAIX activity over the pH range found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (pK = 6.84), and this may be the mechanism whereby excess acid self-limits the build-up of extracellular acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of another <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> inducible CA isoform, CAXII, was upregulated in 3D but not two-dimensional culture in response to CAIX knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAIX knockdown enhanced the effect of bevacizumab treatment, reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> rate in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This work provides evidence that inhibition of the hypoxic adaptation to antiangiogenic therapy enhances bevacizumab treatment and highlights the value of developing small molecules or antibodies which inhibit CAIX for combination therapy </plain></SENT>
