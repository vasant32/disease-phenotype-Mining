<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was withdrawn from the market after the demonstration of an increased risk of cardiovascular complications after prolonged use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it remains an interesting compound for laboratory research as an experimental COX-2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the antiproliferative activity of a novel dinitro-oxy-substituted analogue of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> (NO-rofe), potentially less cardiotoxic, has been investigated in vitro on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and compared with the action of the parent drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to the fact that COX-2 inhibition is the main characteristic of coxibs, we performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments in COX-2-overexpressing (HT-29) and COX-2-negative (SW-480) human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, to elucidate whether the observed effects were dependent on COX-2 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, experiments were performed in order to evaluate whether COX-2 pharmacological inhibition may affect beta-catenin/E-cadherin signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NO-rofe exerted a significant antiproliferative activity on COX-2 positive HT-29 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, being less effective on the COX-2 negative SW-480 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> analogue retained similar potencies with respect to COX-2 inhibition but was much more active than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> in inhibiting the growth of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, this novel compound resulted in the induction of membrane Î²-catenin/E-cadherin expression, a feature that may significantly contribute to its antiproliferative activity </plain></SENT>
