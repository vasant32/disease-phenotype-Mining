<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> rates have increased rapidly in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> includes surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) is a famous Asian tropical fruit. γ-Mangostin is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37647">xanthone</z:chebi> derivative isolated from the fruit hull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we found evidence of anti-inflammatory and anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> activities in γ-mangostin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed further studies to assess the apoptotic effects of γ-mangostin on colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells HT29. γ-Mangostin showed concentration and time-dependent cytotoxic effects on HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microscopic observation under Giemsa staining showed that γ-mangostin induced cellular swelling and the appearance of apoptotic bodies, characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HT29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, flow cytometry analysis showed an increase of hypodiploid cells in γ-mangostin-treated HT29 cells, while enhancement of intracellular <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> production was detected in the same γ-mangostin-treated cells by DCHDA assay and DiOC6(3) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the above results, γ-mangostin has demonstrated anticancer activity and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HT29 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evidence suggests that γ-mangostin could serve as a micronutrient for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> prevention and is a potential lead compound for the development of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> agents </plain></SENT>
