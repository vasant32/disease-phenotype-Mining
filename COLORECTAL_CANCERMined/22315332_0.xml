<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of these studies were to characterize the disposition of GDC-0973 in preclinical species and to determine the relationship of GDC-0973 plasma concentrations to efficacy in Colo205 mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clearance (CL) of GDC-0973 was moderate in mouse (33.5 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)), rat (37.9 ± 7.2 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)), and monkey (29.6 ± 8.5 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CL in dog was low (5.5 ± 0.3 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of distribution across species was large, 6-fold to 15-fold body water; half-lives ranged from 4 to 13 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein binding in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human was high, with percentage unbound, 1 to 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GDC-0973-related radioactivity was rapidly and extensively distributed to tissues; however, low concentrations were observed in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In rats and dogs, [(14)C]GDC-0973 was well absorbed (fraction absorbed, 70-80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of [(14)C]GDC-0973-related radioactivity was recovered in the bile of rat (74-81%) and dog (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CL and volume of distribution of GDC-0973 in human, predicted by allometry, was 2.9 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1) and 9.9 l/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The predicted half-life was 39 h </plain></SENT>
