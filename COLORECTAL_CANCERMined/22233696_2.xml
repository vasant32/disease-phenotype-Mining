<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, colonoscopic identification of SSAs has important implications for preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e>, but accurate endoscopic diagnosis is often difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to clarify which endoscopic findings are specific to SSAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The morphological, histological and molecular features of 261 specimens from 226 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surface microstructures were analyzed using magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation in BRAF and KRAS was examined by pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation of p16, IGFBP7, MLH1 and MINT1, -2, -12 and -31 was analyzed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Through retrospective analysis of a training set (n=145), we identified a novel surface microstructure, the Type II open-shape pit pattern (Type II-O), which was specific to SSAs with BRAF mutation and CIMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent prospective analysis of an independent validation set (n=116) confirmed that the Type II-O pattern is highly predictive of SSAs (sensitivity, 65.5%; specificity, 97.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation and CIMP occurred with significant frequency in Type II-O-positive serrated lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Progression of SSAs to more advanced lesions was associated with further accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation and additional morphological changes, including the Type III, IV and V pit patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the Type II-O pit pattern is a useful hallmark of the premalignant stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> with MSI and CIMP, which could serve to improve the efficacy of colonoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
