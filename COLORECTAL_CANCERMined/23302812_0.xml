<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These guidance cues have been particularly well studied in the mammalian spinal cord, but it remains unclear whether these guidance mechanisms for commissural axons are similar in the developing forebrain, in particular for the corpus callosum, the largest and most important commissure for cortical function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Netrin1 initially attracts callosal pioneering axons derived from the cingulate cortex, but surprisingly is not attractive for the neocortical callosal axons that make up the bulk of the projection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead, we show that Netrin-deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> signaling acts in a fundamentally different manner, to prevent the Slit2-mediated repulsion of precrossing axons thereby allowing them to approach and cross the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first evidence for how callosal axons integrate multiple guidance cues to navigate the midline </plain></SENT>
