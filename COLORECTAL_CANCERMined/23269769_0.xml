<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional mailed survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Alberta, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: 600 CRC survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors randomly identified through the Alberta <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry in Canada completed a mailed survey (34% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Self-reported PA, medical and demographic variables, and PA preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors indicated that they were interested and able to participate in a PA program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common PA preferences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors were to receive PA counseling from a fitness expert at a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center, receive PA information in the form of print materials, start a PA program after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, do PA at home, and walk in both the summer and winter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, oncologists and nurses were identified as preferences from whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors would like to receive PA information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chi-square analyses identified that age, education, annual family income, and current PA were the demographic variables most consistently associated with PA preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors expressed an interest in participating in a PA program and key PA preferences were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those preferences may be useful for developing and implementing successful PA interventions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> nurses are in a unique position to promote PA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, understanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivor PA preferences is essential to assist nurses in making appropriate PA recommendations or referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors' PA participation rates are low, they may have an interest in receiving PA programming and counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors have indicated a preference to receive PA information from individuals within their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> support team (e.g., fitness specialist at a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center, oncologist, nurses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The PA preferences identified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors are important for the development of successful PA interventions </plain></SENT>
