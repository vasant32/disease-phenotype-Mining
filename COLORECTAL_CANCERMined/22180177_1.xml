<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Germline nonsense and frameshift mutations in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_271'>adenomatous polyposis coli</z:mpath> (APC) gene are found in approximately 90% of individuals affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (FAP) and a genotype-phenotype relationship has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Missense mutations have also been found in a few cases, even if their role in FAP is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An association between a missense mutation, APC I1307K, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to improve the knowledge about the genetic effect of APC I1307K on the phenotype, we tried a new approach using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI/MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An APC mutation (I1307K) was found in an index case of a non-Jewish woman and her son with attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> (A-FAP) and no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate whether the presence and abundance of the ionic species are related to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or the presence of mutation, comparative analyses of 11 healthy clean-colon subjects, 59 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (stage II n=19, stage III n=23, stage IV n=17) without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and 9 FAP patients, carriers of a nonsense mutation in the APC gene, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparative analysis of serum protein profiles of the index patient and her healthy son, FAP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, and subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>preneoplastic lesions</z:mpath> showed a characteristic abundance of ionic species at m/z 905, which was not present in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were identified from MALDI/MS/MS spectra of m/z 905 belonging to the kininogen-1 precursor and the human forkhead box protein 01A (FOXO1A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FOXO1A was present in only two subjects carrying I1307K, but not in other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings seem to suggest a relationship between m/z 905, FOXO1A and the development and growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FOXO1A fragment determination in serum with MALDI/MS might be a promising approach for early detection of colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or for the development of targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
