<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a comparative proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from SW480 and SW480APC cells to examine the effects of restored APC on exosome protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A salient finding of our study was the unique expression of the Wnt <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> Dickkopf-related protein 4 (DKK4) in SW480APC, but not parental SW480 cell-derived exosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of DKK4 in SW480APC cells was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunogold electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the DKK4 gene promoter by methylation-specific PCR revealed reduced methylation in SW480APC cells, while RT-PCR demonstrated the downregulation of DNMT-3a, compared to the parental cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our discovery of exosome-mediated secretion of DKK4 opens up the possibility that exosomal DKK4 may be a mechanism used by epithelial colon cells to regulate Wnt signaling which is lost during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
