<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis is important for the diagnosis of hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC) and for the prediction of 5-FU chemotherapy efficiency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, especially in terms of therapeutic response and overall survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the MSI markers recommended by the NIH/NCI, BAT-25 has been extensively studied for its major role in MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAT-25 presents different polymorphisms in different ethnic populations and studies of its polymorphisms in the Chinese population are still very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aims: To analyze the frequency of constitutive polymorphic variation at the BAT-25 locus in Chinese from Jiangsu Province and its implication for locus MSI screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequency of allelic variation at the BAT-25 locus of cervical cells from 500 healthy women and blood from 16 healthy males was assessed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty samples were also analyzed by fragment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from blood of 94 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> was analyzed by fragment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After comparison with the sequencing results, the more frequent allele lengths were 126-127 bp, 128-129 bp, 129-130 bp, respectively consistent with the 24 poly(T) (T24), T25 and T26 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the BAT-25 locus, 516 healthy individuals had respectively 1.36%, 97.28% and 1.36% of the T24, T25 and T26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whereas for the 94 cancer patients allelic frequencies were 0.53%, 1.06%, 96.8%, 1.6% for T15, T24, T25 and T26 alleles respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixteen healthy males had only the T25 allele and heterozygous T15 was only found in 1 male patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We established the relation between fragment length and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17821">thymine</z:chebi> repeats in BAT-25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the BAT-25 locus is quasimonomorphic in Chinese from Jiangsu province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover we showed that variant alleles of BAT-25 were found more likely in blood from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients than in healthy individuals, suggesting the need to perform comparative studies between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and blood, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, as to obtain a correct MSI identification </plain></SENT>
