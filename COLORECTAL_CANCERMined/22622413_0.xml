<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is a major public health challenge in Austria and Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the participation in dedicated colonoscopy screening programs is rather low, the question of alternative methods is raised again and computed tomography (CT) colonography seems to be a gentle alternative with a very high patient acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: In recent years CT colonography (CTC) has been established besides conventional colonoscopy as a radiological method for the investigation of the entire colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From axial two-dimensional images three-dimensional images can be generated, allowing a virtual flight through the colon which is why this technique is also known as virtual colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: The technique of CTC has been improved continuously during recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the one hand the steady decrease in the layer thickness (currently ≤ 1 mm) has improved the resolution of volume data sets and on the other hand there has been significant progress in postprocessing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PERFORMANCE: Numerous studies have recently shown that the significance of CTC in the detection of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> is similar to conventional colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACHIEVEMENTS: Meanwhile CT colonography is now a routine investigation method established in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (screening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Study data now clearly show that CTC, as an alternative to conventional colonoscopy, is a powerful method for investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To achieve good results adequate preparation including fecal tagging, standardized technical procedures during the investigation and expertise in both 2D and 3D reading are essential </plain></SENT>
