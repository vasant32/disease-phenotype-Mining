<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Resistin-like molecules (RELM) are expressed in many tissues and among those, RELMβ is most abundantly expressed in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on animal studies, RELMβ is induced by high fat diets, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and intestinal microflora and may play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated whether RELMβ could be measured in human plasma and the influence of selected host and behavioral factors on RELMβ levels, including known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects for this pilot study were derived from healthy controls who participated in a population-based case-control study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Metropolitan Detroit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 45-80 years of age without history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RELMβ was present in human plasma, with levels in the range of 0.08-0.26 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower RELMβ levels were found in subjects with non-Caucasian race, lower pack-years of smoking, and higher physical activity index scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other variables such as dietary intakes, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi> and history of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were not associated with RELMβ levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The direct association of RELMβ with smoking and inverse association with physical activity, both of which are risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, indicates that RELMβ may be involved in mediating the effects of these two lifestyle factors on risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
