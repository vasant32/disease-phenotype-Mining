<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to observe the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> on the systematic immune response in the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methodology: Sixty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were enrolled from Jan 2005 to Dec 2005 from Taizhou Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were administrated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> (0.8g·d-1 or 1.2g·d-1) or saline from the day of admission to the 10th POD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous blood sample was collected and the T-, B- and NK-lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specimens were subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) response examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: The levels of CD3 and CD4 T-lymphocytes were increased significantly in both low and high dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> groups 10 days after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of CD19 B cells was also elevated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant changes were observed in the CD8, CD4/CD8 value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TIL responses in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> groups were also enhanced significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">Cimetidine</z:chebi> can alleviate systematic immunosuppression and improve the local immune function of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
