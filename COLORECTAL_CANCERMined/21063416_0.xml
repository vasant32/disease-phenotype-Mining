<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following reporting of severe diarrhoea and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 2000 mg m(-2) per day plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> every 3 weeks (CAPOX 2000) in 2006, we instituted a policy change to reduce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose to 1700 mg m(-2) per day (CAPOX 1700) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a retrospective analysis comparing toxicities encountered before and after this dose change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 400 patients treated, no significant differences were seen between the CAPOX 2000 and CAPOX 1700 in grades 3 and 4 diarrhoea (21% vs 19%; P=0.80), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (0% vs 1%; P=0.50) or grades 2-4 hand foot syndrome (16% vs 11%; P=0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grades 3 and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (9.5% vs 3.5%; P=0.03) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020433" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperbilirubinaemia</z:e> (60% vs 40%; P&lt;0.0001) were significantly reduced with CAPOX 1700 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of hospitalisation due to toxicities were not different between two groups (13% vs 11%; P=0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No clinically or statistically significant differences in gastrointestinal toxicities or hospitalisation rate were seen after reducing our routine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose from CAPOX 2000 to CAPOX 1700 </plain></SENT>
