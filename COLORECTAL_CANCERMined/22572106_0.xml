<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although systemic therapies have shown to result in survival benefit in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC), outcomes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) are poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No data are available on outcomes of current chemotherapy schedules plus targeted agents in mCRC patients with PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Previously untreated mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy in the CAIRO study and with chemotherapy and targeted therapy in the CAIRO2 study were included and retrospectively analysed according to presence or absence of PC at randomisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and occurrence of toxicity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with PC were identified in the CAIRO study and 47 patients in the CAIRO2 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median OS was decreased for patients with PC compared with patients without PC (CAIRO: 10.4 versus 17.3 months, respectively (p â‰¤ 0.001); CAIRO2: 15.2 versus 20.7 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median number of treatment cycles did not differ between patients with or without PC in both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of major toxicity was more frequent in patients with PC treated with sequential chemotherapy in the CAIRO study as compared to patients without PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was not reflected in reasons to discontinue treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the CAIRO2 study, no differences in major toxicity were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate decreased efficacy of current standard chemotherapy with and without targeted agents in mCRC patients with PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the poor outcome cannot be explained by undertreatment or increased susceptibility to toxicity, but rather by relative resistance to treatment </plain></SENT>
