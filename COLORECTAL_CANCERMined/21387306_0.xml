<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly, KRAS mutations at codons 12 and 13 have a high prognostic value for EGFR-directed antibody therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several methods are available to detect the most common mutations, some of them are commercialized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequently used techniques, allele-specific PCR or direct sequencing, are not standardized and often lack sensitivity to detect low amounts of mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in paraffin-embedded tissue-blocks leading to a high number of false-negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present a reliable, fast, cost-effective and sensitive approach for KRAS mutation detection that has a high potential for standardized large scale screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method is based on multiplexed primer extension reactions coupled to HPLC separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highly sensitive assay gives easily interpretable and reproducible results at affordable costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We describe the method and an application example for diagnosis in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
