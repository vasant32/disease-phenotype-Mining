<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patient navigation (PN) has been suggested as a way to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> health disparities; however, many models of PN exist and most have not been carefully evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to test the Ohio American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Society model of PN as it relates to reducing time to diagnostic resolution among persons with abnormal breast, cervical, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests or symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 862 patients from 18 clinics participated in this group-randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chart review documented the date of the abnormality and the date of resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis used shared frailty models to test for the effect of PN on time to resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crude HR were reported as there was no evidence of confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HRs became significant at 6 months; conditional on the random clinic effect, the resolution rate at 15 months was 65% higher in the PN arm (P = 0.012 for difference in resolution rate across arms; P = 0.009 for an increase in the HR over time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Participants with abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening tests or symptoms resolved faster if assigned to PN compared with those not assigned to PN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of PN became apparent beginning six months after detection of the abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: PN may help address health disparities by reducing time to resolution after an abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening test </plain></SENT>
