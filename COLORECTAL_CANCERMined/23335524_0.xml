<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the results of HAI of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 22 CRC patients treated with HAI of combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and 5-FU and LV was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Partial response (PR) was observed in 4 (18%) patients and stable disease (SD) in 7, with an overall disease control rate of 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7 and 11 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients treated with first-line treatment underwent subsequent liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, HAI of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, 5-FU and LV was combined with systemic administration of bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate reasonable efficacy of HAI with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, 5-FU and LV in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
