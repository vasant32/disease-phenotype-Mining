<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study aims to develop a robust gene expression classifier that can predict disease relapse in patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh frozen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue from 188 patients with stage I to IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> undergoing surgery was analyzed using Agilent 44K oligonucleotide arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 65.1 months, and the majority of patients (83.6%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nearest mean classifier was developed using a cross-validation procedure to score <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes for their association with 5-year distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An optimal set of 18 genes was identified and used to construct a prognostic classifier (ColoPrint) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signature was validated on an independent set of 206 samples from patients with stage I, II, and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signature classified 60% of patients as low risk and 40% as high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year relapse-free survival rates were 87.6% (95% CI, 81.5% to 93.7%) and 67.2% (95% CI, 55.4% to 79.0%) for low- and high-risk patients, respectively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.33 to 4.73; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the signature remained one of the most significant prognostic factors, with an HR of 2.69 (95% CI, 1.41 to 5.14; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the signature had an HR of 3.34 (P = .017) and was superior to American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> criteria in assessing the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> without prescreening for microsatellite instability (MSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ColoPrint significantly improves the prognostic accuracy of pathologic factors and MSI in patients with stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and facilitates the identification of patients with stage II disease who may be safely managed without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
