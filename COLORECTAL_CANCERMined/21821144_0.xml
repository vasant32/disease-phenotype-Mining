<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterized naturally occurring HPGDS isoenzymes, to see if HPGDS variation is associated with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used DNA heteroduplex analysis and sequencing to identify HPGDS variants among healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HPGDS isoenzymes were produced in bacteria, and their catalytic activities were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine in vivo effects, we conducted pooled case-control analyses to assess whether there is an association of the isoenzyme with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Roughly 8% of African Americans and 2% of Caucasians had a highly stable Val187lle isoenzyme (with isoleucine instead of valine at position 187) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 37°C, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> enzyme lost 15% of its activity in 1h, whereas the Val187Ile form remained &gt;95% active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 50°C, the half life of native HPGDS was 9min, compared to 42 min for Val187Ile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among African Americans with Val187Ile was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.75-1.62; 533 cases, 795 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Val187Ile HPGDS isoenzyme common among African Americans is not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other approaches will be needed to establish a role for HPGDS in occurrence of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e>, as indicated by a mouse model </plain></SENT>
