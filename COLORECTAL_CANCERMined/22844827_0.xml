<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the results achieved by simultaneous resection (SR) vs. delayed resection (DR) in patients with synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (SCRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In "Dan Setlacec" Center of General Surgery and Liver Transplantation from Fundeni Clinical Institute, between 1995 and 2010, 117 patients underwent SR and 25 patients underwent DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was compared the outcome of the patients in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also assessed if certain subgroups of patients present a better outcome after DR than after SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, the number and diameter of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and the proportion of major hepatectomies were similar in the two groups (p value &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the morbidity, mortality, disease-free and overall surrvival rates were not statistically significant different between the two groups (p value &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subgroups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e>, with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, and undergoing major hepatectomies, the morbidity, mortality and survival rates achieved by SR were similar to those achieved by DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Simultaneous resection of SCRLM is similarly safe and efficient as the delayed resection, even in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e>, with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, or undergoing major hepatectomies </plain></SENT>
