<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the trends of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its corresponding clinical presentation in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> registry patients were divided into 3 groups according to age:&lt;50, 50-75, andÂ &gt;75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed for average-risk patients &lt;50 years of age to assess clinicopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 3,599 patients between 1982 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients aged &lt;50 years increased from 6.8% in (1982-1990) to 8.5% in (2000-2010) with a decrease in the 50-75-year age group from 45.5% to 43.4% (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred eighty-eight patients were &lt;50 years of age at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are mostly symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Advanced disease at presentation could be caused by a delay in investigating these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy should be offered early to young patients presenting with warning symptoms </plain></SENT>
