<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Choice between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (OxCap) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/leucovorin (LV)/infusional 5-FU (OxFU) was by physician and patient choice and switching regimen was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared OxCap with OxFU and OxCap+cetuximab with OxFU+cetuximab retrospectively in patients and examined efficacy, toxicity profiles and the effect of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 64% of 2397 patients received OxCap(± cetuximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival, progression free survival and overall response rate were similar between OxCap and OxFU but rate of radical surgeries was higher for OxFU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression free survival was longer for OxFU+cetuximab compared with OxCap+cetuximab but other efficacy measures were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>/LV/infusional 5-FU (± cetuximab) was associated with more mucositis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> whereas OxCap(± cetuximab) caused more gastrointestinal toxicities and palmar-plantar <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 118 patients switched regimen, mainly due to toxicity; only 16% came off their second regimen due to intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (CrCl) 50-80 ml min(-1) on OxCap(± cetuximab) or OxFU+cetuximab had more dose modifications than those with better renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, OxFU and OxCap are equally effective in treating aCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the toxicity profiles differ and switching from one regimen to the other for poor tolerance is a reasonable option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with CrCl 50-80 ml min(-1) on both regimens require close toxicity monitoring </plain></SENT>
