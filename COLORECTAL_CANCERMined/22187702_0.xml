<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combination of inflammatory cytokines has an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to screen for alterations located in promoter and exons of IL-16 gene sequence, to determine the distribution of genotypes in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and healthy controls in a sample of Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The case group consisted of 260 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the control group included 405 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three IL-16 gene polymorphisms (rs4072111, rs11556218, rs4778889) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RFLP results were confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association between rs11556218 SNP in the IL-16 gene and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TG genotype of rs11556218 T/G polymorphism showed significant association with a 1.75 fold increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P=0.005; adjusted OR: 1.759; 95% CI: 1.191-2.598) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition a significant association between CC genotype of rs4778889 T/C polymorphism and decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in male subjects (P=0.045; adjusted OR: 0.192; 95% CI: 0.038-0.967) was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first report of IL-16 gene polymorphisms among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest an influence of rs11556218 T &gt; G and rs4778889 T/C polymorphisms on the altered risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
