<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the number of lymph nodes harvested in laparoscopic versus open <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery early in a surgeon's career </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the data of 80 patients operated upon with a primary diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between September 2006 and June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were from a single fellowship trained colorectal surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of laparoscopic versus open surgery, and neoadjuvant radiation were examined to assess lymph node harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the lymph nodes harvested during laparoscopic versus open surgery (17.4 vs 18.5; P=0.5920) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of lymph nodes harvested decreased with increasing American Society of Anesthesiology grade (22.4, 17.1, 19.2, 7.0 for American Society of Anesthesiology grade I, II, III, IV, respectively; P=0.0412) and with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (18.7 vs 13.2; P=0.0151) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery results in the same number of lymph nodes being harvested as in open surgery </plain></SENT>
