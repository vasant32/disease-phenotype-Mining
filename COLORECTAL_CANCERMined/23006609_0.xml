<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of CLE for discriminating colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> from non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and its contributing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The secondary aim was to compare the efficacy of endomicroscopy and chromoendoscopy for diagnosing colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A systematic review of the literature published between 2000 and 2012 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled sensitivity and specificity were compared using univariate regression analysis according to prespecified subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled relative risk was computed to compare the accuracy of endomicroscopy and chromoendoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen studies involving 719 patients and 2290 specimens were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pooled sensitivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies was 0.94 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.88-0.97], and pooled specificity was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time CLE yielded higher sensitivity (0.96 vs 0.85, P &lt; 0.001) and specificity (0.97 vs 0.82, P &lt; 0.001) than blinded CLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For real-time CLE, endoscopy-based systems had better sensitivity (0.96 vs 0.89, P &lt; 0.001) and specificity (0.99 vs 0.82, P &lt; 0.0001) than probe-based systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CLE yielded equivalent accuracy compared with magnifying virtual chromoendoscopy and magnifying pigment chromoendoscopy (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CLE is comparable to colonoscopic histopathology in diagnosing colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and is better in conjunction with conventional endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An endoscopy-based rather than a probe-based modality would be optimal in the application of CLE </plain></SENT>
