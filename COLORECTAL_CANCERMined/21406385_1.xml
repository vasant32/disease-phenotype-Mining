<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study was a retrospective morbidity study based on 2024 subjects occupationally exposed to asbestos, conducted over the period 1 January 1978 to 31 December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the dose-response relationship between occupational asbestos exposure, as a time-dependant variable, and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was performed using a Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to account for the effect of latency, we conducted the analysis with a lag of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 285 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were observed in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of pleuro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100003'>peritoneal mesothelioma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated with asbestos exposure, adjusted for age as a time-dependant variable and for sex, was correlated with exposure intensity (or average exposure level, AEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, whatever the anatomical site, did not increase with the duration of exposure to asbestos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While confirming the established relationship between asbestos exposure and pleuropulmonary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153467" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal cancers</z:e>, this study also suggests a causal relationship between asbestos exposure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
