<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The imaging potential of a new (18)F-labelled methionine derivative, S-(3-[(18)F]fluoropropyl)-D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> ((18)F-D-FPHCys), and its selectivity for amino acid transporter subtypes were investigated in vitro and by imaging of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of members of the system L (LAT isoforms 1-4 and 4F2hc) and ASCT (ASCT isoforms 1 and 2) amino acid transporter subclasses were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR in four human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> models, including A431 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, PC3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, and Colo 205 and HT-29 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first investigations for the characterization of (18)F-D-FPHCys were in vitro uptake studies by comparing it with [1-(14)C]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16643">L-methionine</z:chebi> ((14)C-MET) and in vivo by PET imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the specific involvement of LAT1 transporters in (18)F-D-FPHCys accumulation was tested by silencing LAT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription with siRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the proliferative activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> xenografts ex vivo, Ki-67 staining was used as a biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A431 cells showed the highest (18)F-D-FPHCys uptake in vitro and in vivo followed by Colo 205, PC3 and HT-29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of retention was observed with (14)C-MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(18)F-D-FPHCys retention was strongly correlated with LAT1 expression both in vitro (R(2) = 0.85) and in vivo (R(2) = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of LAT1 by siRNA inhibited (18)F-D-FPHCys uptake, demonstrating a clear dependence on this transporter for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, (18)F-D-FPHCys accumulation mirrored cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The favourable properties of (18)F-D-FPHCys make this tracer a promising imaging probe for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> as well as for the noninvasive evaluation and monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
