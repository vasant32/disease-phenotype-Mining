<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated disease of the colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the immunological responses of the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The epithelial invasion of pathogenic bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> mediated by intestinal immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the etiology of UC is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian immigrants in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased prevalence of UC also contributes to an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Environmental factors, including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and vegetable intake, whereas total fat, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36009">omega-6 fatty acids</z:chebi> and meat intake were positively associated with an increased risk of UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual dietary factors and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excess energy intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi> and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in the course of UC development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this review, the increased prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population, intestinal epithelium permeability, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
