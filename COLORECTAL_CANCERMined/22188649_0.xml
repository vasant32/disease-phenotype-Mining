<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>5-FU is processed intracellularly to yield active metabolites that compromise <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms responsible for its cytotoxicity are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the phenotypic analysis of mutant chicken B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> DT40 cells, we found that homologous recombinational repair (HRR), involving Rad54 and BRCA2, and the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway, involving Rad9 and Rad17, significantly contribute to 5-FU tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5-FU induced γH2AX nuclear foci, which were colocalized with the key HRR factor Rad51, but not with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), in a dose-dependent manner as cells accumulated in the S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Chk1 kinase by UCN-01 increased 5-FU-induced γH2AX and enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity not only in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells but also in Rad54- or BRCA2-deficient cells, suggesting that HRR and Chk1 kinase have non-overlapping roles in 5-FU tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5-FU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was significantly impaired in Rad9- or Rad17-deficient cells, and severe γH2AX nuclear foci and DSBs were formed, which was followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, inhibition of Chk1 kinase by UCN-01 increased 5-FU-induced γH2AX nuclear foci and enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity in Rad9- or Rad17-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Rad9- and Rad17-independent activation of the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway also significantly contributes to 5-FU tolerance </plain></SENT>
