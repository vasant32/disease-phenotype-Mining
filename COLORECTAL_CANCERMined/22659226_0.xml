<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine progress toward Healthy People 2010 goals for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among ethnic/racial groups, including disaggregated Latino groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multivariate logistic regressions examined associations between ethnicity/race and primary outcomes of self-reported guideline-concordant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screenings considering time trends for 65,947 respondents of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2000 to 2007 age 50-years and older from six groups (non-Latino White, non-Latino Black, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Other Latino) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also tested for modification effects by education, income, and health insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most groups approached Healthy People 2010 CRC screening rate goals, including non-Latino Whites (47%), non-Latino Blacks (42%) and Puerto Ricans (40%), while Mexicans remained disparately lower (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher education, income and insurance coverage, partially attenuated this lower likelihood, but Mexican rates remained significantly lower than non-Latino Whites for receiving endoscopy in the past 5 years {OR(95% CI)=0.68(0.59-0.77)} and having received any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening {0.70(0.62-0.79)} </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among ethnic/racial groups examined, only Mexicans met healthcare disparity criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that healthcare equity goals can be attained if resources affecting continuity of care or ability to pay for preventive services are available, and targeted populations are adequately identified </plain></SENT>
