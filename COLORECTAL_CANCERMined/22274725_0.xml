<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluated the role of marital relationship factors such as a relational perspective on the frequency of spouse discussions about screening and screening intentions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual-level factors were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight couples with both members non-adherent with screening completed measures of perceived risk, screening benefits and barriers, marital quality, relational perspective, discussion frequency, and screening intentions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Couples' attitudes about screening were interdependent and one partner's attitudes and behavior were associated with the other partner's intention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also evidence of joint effects in that intentions were associated with both one's partner's attitudes and one's own attitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal screening intentions are associated with both partners' attitudes as well as whether or not couples have discussed screening with one another </plain></SENT>
