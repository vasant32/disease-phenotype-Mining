<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a recent report, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> thickness at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> interface (TNI) was confirmed as a prognosticator for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> after adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the hepatectomy specimens with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> from <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in a single tertiary hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 23 patients could be included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following the recommendations by Maru et al., two independent pathologists, blinded to the outcome of the patients, measured the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> thickness at the TNI in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin stained representative slides of the hepatectomy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome was estimated as the time elapsed between hepatectomy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to disease (disease-specific survival; DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed a complete pathological response, 16 cases a major response, and 5 cases a minor pathological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean thickness at the TNI was 0.73mm (0.01-2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ROC analysis defined a cut-off point of 1.34mm best discriminated between patients with a good and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean thickness at the TNI for patients dying of disease was 1.99 (1.06 for survivors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the survival curves confirmed that thickness at the TNI was a significant predictor of disease-free survival (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> thickness and TNI in predicting disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that thickness of TNI is an important prognostic variable following hepatic resection of colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are necessary to confirm these retrospective results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pathology reporting of this parameter, together with the pathological response and margin, may help clinicians to make decisions regarding further therapy </plain></SENT>
