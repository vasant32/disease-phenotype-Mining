<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UV light induces precise cellular and genomic mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of ultraviolet A (UVA) (320-400 nm) was used as a generic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> to evaluate in vitro different sensitivities from lymphocytes of patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> (SM), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> (MM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis coli</z:e> (PC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA damage was evaluated by two different methods: the micronucleus (MN) assay and the Comet assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline frequency of MNs was significantly increased in lymphocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (SM, MM, PC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) when compared to healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After UV irradiation, MN frequencies were significantly increased in lymphocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, both patients and healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the MN frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups was significantly higher than in the healthy individual group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results for the induction of genomic DNA damage were obtained for the Comet assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also for the Comet assay, UVA-induced DNA damage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patient groups was significantly increased when compared to healthy individuals (SM, MM, PC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> groups: P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusively, peripheral lymphocytes from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous states</z:e> SM and PC are more sensitive to a generic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> such as UVA than lymphocytes from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This feature may be used as an essential biomarker to screen and diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous states</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in early stages </plain></SENT>
