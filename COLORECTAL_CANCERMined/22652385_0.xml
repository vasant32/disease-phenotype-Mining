<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a modified model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo>, we investigated plastic changes at the cortical level as possible mechanisms underlying the chronicity of pain sensation in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in gene expression were studied using DNA microarray which revealed that when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated animals displayed clinical neuropathic pain symptoms, including mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, approximately 900 were down-regulated in the somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the known role of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels in neuronal excitability, the study further focussed on the down-regulation of these channels as the possible molecular origin of cortical hyperexcitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantification of the magnitude of neuronal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in cortical neurons as a marker of neuronal activity revealed a 10-fold increase induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> treatment, suggesting that neurons of cortical areas involved in transmission of painful stimuli undergo a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cortical excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated, using cortical injection of lentiviral vector shRNA against Kv2.2, that down-regulation of this <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel in naive animals induced a sustained thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although the detailed mechanisms leading to this cortical excitability are still unknown, our study demonstrated that a cortical down regulation of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels could underlie pain chronicity in this model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain </plain></SENT>
