<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study were to assess the outcomes and costs of the first two biennial rounds of a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program using the immunochemical fecal occult blood test (i-FOBT) in a northern Italian province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> residents aged 50 - 69 years were invited to take part in a biennial screening program using a 1-day i-FOBT, followed by colonoscopy in positive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The i-FOBT uptake, compliance to colonoscopy, detection rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> according to age and sex, and direct cost analysis were carried out separately for the 1st and 2nd rounds of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 78 083 (1st round) and 81 619 (2nd round) individuals who were invited to screening, the participation rates were 49.7 % and 54.4 % and i-FOBT positivity rates were 6.2 % and 5.8 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were lower in the 2nd screening compared with the 1st one (1.6‰ vs. 2.5‰ for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and 15.8‰ vs. 17.9‰ for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, respectively), whereas positive predictive values for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> were similar in both rounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 165 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> detected, 52 % were Dukes' stage A and 21 % were stage B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cost indicators were slightly higher in the 1st round of screening compared with the 2nd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The direct cost per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection was similar in the two rounds (€ 1252 and € 1260, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compliance and diagnostic yield of i-FOBT screening were satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were at a very early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Program costs were reasonable and did not increase with repeat screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening could contribute to decreasing the cost of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> care by improving the stage at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
