<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify the genetic drivers of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, we applied array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to 13 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of early, localized human <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinomas</z:mp> arising in high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (so-called "malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions are small and hence the amount of DNA is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the quality of DNA is compromised due to the fragmentation as a consequence of formalin fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To overcome these problems, we optimized a newly developed isothermal whole genome amplification system (NuGEN Ovation® WGA FFPE System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Starting with 100 ng of FFPE DNA, the amplification system produced 4.01 ± 0.29 μg (mean ± standard deviation) of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The excellent quality of amplified DNA was further indicated by a high signal-to-noise ratio and a low derivative log(2) ratio spread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both, the amount of amplified DNA and aCGH performance were independent of the age of the FFPE blocks and the associated degradation of the extracted DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed losses of chromosome arms 5q and 18q in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> components of the malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> samples, while the embedded early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> revealed losses of 8p, 17p, and 18, and gains of 7, 13, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aberrations detected in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> components were invariably maintained in the embedded <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach demonstrates that using isothermally whole genome amplified FFPE DNA is technically suitable for aCGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to demonstrating the clonal origin of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> part within a malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>, the gain of chromosome arm 20q was an indicator for progression from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
