<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is one of the common <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> in humans, and the incidence rate is gradually increasing year by year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survivin and CD44v3 are ideal targets for gene therapy due to their overexpression in colorectal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies show that downregulation of survivin could promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and depress proliferation, and reduction of CD44v3 expression could inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasive capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to achieve satisfactory curative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we use survivin and CD44v3 short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (shRNA) combined transfection into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line SW480 to investigate its effects on the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, proliferation and invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ShRNA plasmids targeting survivin and CD44v3 were singly or co-transfected into SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The co-transfection group exhibited the most significant inhibitory effect on cell growth (P &lt; 0.05) and the highest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the invasive capacity in the co-transfected group was the least </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> inhibition rate of the cotransfected group in xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mice was significantly higher than other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the microvessel density of the co-transfected group was significantly decreased compared with other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest combined transfection of survivin shRNA and CD44v3 shRNA may produce a synergistic effect on gene therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
