<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to determine the relationship between HRQOL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, using nationally representative public data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 2010 BRFSS data were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals younger than age 50 years were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Missing data were imputed using the multiple imputation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to the data to determine the association between different components of HRQOL (physical HRQOL, mental HRQOL, activity limitation caused by poor mental or physical HRQOL, and general health status) and receipt of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening tests (fecal occult blood testing [FOBT] in the past year, sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years, and colonoscopy in the past 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study sample comprised 301,488 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 12% of the respondents had received FOBT in the past year, 62.6% had received sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years, or colonoscopy in the past 10 years, and 65.4% had received either of the screening tests within appropriate time frames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After controlling for demographic and health-related covariates, an inverse relationship was observed between HRQOL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening with the exception of mental HRQOL and FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship between mental HRQOL and FOBT was found to be nonsignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Policy makers should consider including HRQOL as an important parameter when designing interventions aimed at improving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates </plain></SENT>
