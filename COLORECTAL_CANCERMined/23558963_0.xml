<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acting downstream of this pathway, Yes-associated protein (YAP) was implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to explore the expression patterns and clinical significance of YAP in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated the relationship between YAP expression and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 139 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues were investigated by immunohistochemistry for the expression of YAP, cyclin D1, and β-catenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between YAP expression and clinicopathologic features was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that YAP was overexpressed in 52.5 % (73/139) cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and predominantly presented in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an excellent correlation between YAP expression and pTNM stage (p = 0.0024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>YAP expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was significantly correlated with nodal status (p = 0.0034), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> status (p = 0.0382), and cyclin D1 overexpression (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, YAP expression was associated with short overall survival (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with YAP-positive and nuclear β-catenin-positive profiles had worse overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that YAP expression was an independent prognostic indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (p = 0.0207) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that YAP overexpression contributed to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and played a pivotal role in the progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and the interaction of YAP and Wnt/β-catenin pathways needs further exploration </plain></SENT>
