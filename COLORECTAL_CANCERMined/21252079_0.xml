<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is great interest in understanding the relationship among S, T, and Z </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A principal stratification (PS) framework has been proposed by Frangakis and Rubin (2002) to study their causal associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we extend the framework to a multiple trial setting and propose a Bayesian hierarchical PS model to assess surrogacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We apply the method to data from a large collection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> trials in which S and T are binary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We obtain the trial-specific causal measures among S, T, and Z, as well as their overall population-level counterparts that are invariant across trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The method allows for information sharing across trials and reduces the nonidentifiability problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examine the frequentist properties of our model estimates and the impact of the monotonicity assumption using simulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also illustrate the challenges in evaluating surrogacy in the counterfactual framework that result from nonidentifiability </plain></SENT>
