<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the associations of prediagnosis and postdiagnosis recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting with mortality among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a cohort of adults without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at baseline in 1992-1993, we identified 2,293 participants who were diagnosed with invasive, nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> up to mid-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, before their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis, and again after their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis, participants completed detailed questionnaires that included information concerning recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a maximum follow-up of 16.1 years after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis, 846 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> died, 379 of them from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Engaging in 8.75 or more metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week of recreational physical activity (equivalent to approximately 150 minutes per week of walking) compared with fewer than 3.5 MET hours per week was associated with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (prediagnosis physical activity: relative risk [RR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.89; postdiagnosis physical activity: RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spending 6 or more hours per day of leisure time sitting compared with fewer than 3 hours per day was associated with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (prediagnosis sitting time: RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.68; postdiagnosis sitting time: RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More recreational physical activity before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis was associated with lower mortality, whereas longer leisure time spent sitting was associated with higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
