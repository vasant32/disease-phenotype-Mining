<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Stark differences exist between adult (&gt;<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e> 70) and juvenile (∼<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e> 21-34) rodents in how <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> (deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) receptors and sensitization to <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> interact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, repeated <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> upregulates <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> receptor expression selectively in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), an effect that is critical for sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> administered to juveniles downregulates VTA <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, whereas adult dcc heterozygous mice fail to sensitize when repeatedly treated with <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>, drug treatment during the juvenile period actually abolishes this adult "protective" phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We set out to determine whether adolescence (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PND</z:e> ∼35-55) is a period during which: (1) <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>-induced alterations in VTA <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> expression switch from downregulation to upregulation; (2) the "protective" phenotype of adult dcc heterozygotes against sensitization becomes evident; and (3) the adult "protective" phenotype of dcc heterozygotes can still be abolished by repeated <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repeated <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> did not significantly alter VTA <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> expression in adolescent rodents when assessed 1 week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and dcc heterozygous mice exhibited sensitization at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, but not dcc heterozygotes, exhibited sensitization when tested during adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adolescence is a time of transition for dcc heterozygotes as related to sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> may be a key factor in determining age-dependent individual differences in vulnerability to sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given that exposure to drugs of abuse during adolescence can have profound consequences for adulthood, the resilience of adult dcc heterozygous mice against adolescent exposure to <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> is particularly salient </plain></SENT>
