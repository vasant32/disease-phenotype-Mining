<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To date, there has been little investigation of the risk for drug-drug interactions involving monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present work examined the effects of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody on the plasma, tissue, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> disposition of T84.66, an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody, in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice bearing CEA-expressing human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (LS174T) xenografts were divided into control and anti-VEGF-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> reached 200-300 mm(3) in size, (125)I-T84.66 was administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg (400 μCi/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radioactivity in plasma and tissue samples was counted, and T84.66 concentrations were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Areas under the concentration vs. time curves (AUC) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In separate groups of mice, Evans Blue Dye was administered to evaluate the effect of anti-VEGF on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vascular permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The investigations did not demonstrate significant effects of anti-VEGF therapy on T84.66 pharmacokinetics in plasma or in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T84.66 plasma AUC((0-10 days)) values were 2.37 × 10(3) ± 1.54 × 10(2) and 2.56 × 10(3) ± 1.01 × 10(2) nM × day, for the control and treated groups (p = 0.148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, anti-VEGF treatment significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vascular permeability to Evans Blue Dye by 45.0 % (p = 0.0012), and anti-VEGF therapy decreased T84.66 tumor AUC((0-10 days)) by more than 60 % (7.27 × 10(2) ± 51.4 vs. 1.98 × 10(3) ± 90.1 nM × day, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that anti-VEGF therapies may lead to a substantial reduction in the delivery of monoclonal antibodies to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is interesting and important to note that this pharmacokinetic interaction occurs at the target site, and that no alterations in T84.66 disposition were visible based on assessment of plasma pharmacokinetics alone </plain></SENT>
