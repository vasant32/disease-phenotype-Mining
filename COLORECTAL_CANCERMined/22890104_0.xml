<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: It was developed by the strict translation procedure of EORTC translation guidelines, including translation, back translation, a pilot test and a cultural adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three instruments (QLQ-CR38, Quality of Life Instruments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Patients-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>, and Functional Assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Therapy-Colorectal) were used on a sample of 110 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at the time of their admission to the hospital and 1-2 days after hospitalization, and a subsample of patients was measured a third time at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The psychometric properties were evaluated by correlational analysis, multi-trait scaling analysis, factor analysis, and t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multi-trait scaling analysis and correlation analysis among domains and items of the three instruments showed good construct validity and criterion-related validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's Î± and the test-retest reliability coefficients were greater than 0.70 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains (except chemotherapy side effects, 0.44 and 0.60, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> domains had statistically significant changes after treatment with the standardized response mean ranging from 0.44 to 2.47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The simplified Chinese version of QLQ-CR38 has good validity, reliability, and responsiveness and can be used to measure the quality of life of Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
