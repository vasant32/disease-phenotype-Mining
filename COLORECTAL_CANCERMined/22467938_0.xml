<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A noninferiority (NI) trial is sometimes employed to show efficacy of a new treatment when it is unethical to randomize current patients to placebo because of the established efficacy of a standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under this framework, if the NI trial determines that the treatment advantage of the standard to the new drug (i.e. S-N) is less than the historic advantage of the standard to placebo (S-P), then the efficacy of the new treatment (N-P) is established indirectly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explicitly combine information from the NI trial with estimates from a random effects model, allowing study-to-study variability in k historic trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Existing methods under random effects, such as the synthesis method, fail to account for the variability of the true standard versus placebo effect in the NI trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our method effectively uses a prediction interval for the missing standard versus placebo effect rather than a confidence interval of the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consequences are to increase the variance of the synthesis method by incorporating a prediction variance term and to approximate the null distribution of the new statistic with a t with k-1 degrees of freedom instead of the standard <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is harder to conclude NI of the new to (predicted) placebo, compared with traditional methods, especially when k is small or when between study variability is large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the between study variances are nonzero, we demonstrate substantial Type I error rate inflation with conventional approaches; simulations suggest that the new procedure has only modest inflation, and it is very conservative when between study variances are zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An example is used to illustrate practical issues </plain></SENT>
