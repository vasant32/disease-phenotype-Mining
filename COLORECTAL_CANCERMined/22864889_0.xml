<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant number of these can be considered for repeat liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the outcomes of repeat liver resection for the treatment of recurrent colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> confined to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent repeat liver resection in a single tertiary referral hepatobiliary centre were identified from a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological variables were analysed to assess factors predictive of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 195 patients underwent repeat resection between 1993 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age was 63 years, and the median interval between first and repeat resection was 13·8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (16·9 per cent) underwent completion hemihepatectomy or extended hemihepatectomy and the remainder had non-anatomical or segmental resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate was 1·5 per cent, and the overall 30-day morbidity rate was 20·0 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 91·2, 44·3 and 29·4 per cent respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> size 5 cm or greater was the only independent predictor of overall survival (relative risk 1·71, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·08 to 2·70; P = 0·021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before resection, perioperative blood transfusion, bilobar disease, R1 resection margin and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were among factors that did not significantly influence survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Repeat hepatic resection remains the only curative option for patients presenting with recurrent colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
