<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations of the KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA oncogenes are frequently found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular occurrence of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and to study the association of these events with clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our study, DNA was extracted from 200 cases of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutation analysis was performed by PCR and pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using statistical methods, we analyzed the relationships between the gene mutations and clinicopathological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS point mutations were detected in 63/200 patients (31.5%), with codon 12 mutations in 52/200 patients (26%), codon 13 mutations in 10/200 patients (5%) and codon 12.13 bi-mutations in 1/200 patients (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The V600E mutations of BRAF were detected in 14/200 patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PIK3CA point mutations (exon 9, exon 20) were detected in 25/200 (12.5%) patients, exon 9 mutatons in 12/200 patients (6%) and exon 20 mutations in 13/200 (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggested that both KRAS and BRAF mutations are exclusive, but KRAS and PIK3CA mutations are coexistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mutational status of BRAF did not correlate with Dukes' staging, histological type, age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, strong associations were found between KRAS, PIK3CA mutations and Dukes' staging (staging D, 12/25, 48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Notably, our data indicated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with KRAS and PIK3CA bi-mutations are more likely to develop into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
