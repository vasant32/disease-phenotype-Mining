<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Re-sequencing was used to comprehensively annotate the 17kb region of strong linkage disequilibrium encompassing rs4444235 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through bioinformatic analyses using H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3, and DNase-I hypersensitivity chromatin signatures and evolutionary conservation we identified seven candidate disease-causing single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to six regions within the 17-kb region predicted to have regulatory potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reporter gene studies of these regions demonstrated that the element to which rs4444235 maps acts as an allele-specific transcriptional enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific expression studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines heterozygous for rs4444235 showed significantly increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) associated with the risk allele (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence for a functional basis for the non-coding risk variant rs4444235 at 14q22.2 and emphasizes the importance of genetic variation in the BMP pathway genes as determinants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
