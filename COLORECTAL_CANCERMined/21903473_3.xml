<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether combination treatment is better than the sequential administration of the same drugs in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients (1:1 ratio) with advanced, measurable, non-resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and WHO performance status 0-2 to receive either first-line treatment with bolus (400 mg/m(2)) and infusional (2400 mg/m(2)) fluorouracil plus leucovorin (400 mg/m(2)) (simplified LV5FU2 regimen), second-line LV5FU2 plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (100 mg/m(2)) (FOLFOX6), and third-line LV5FU2 plus irinotecan (180 mg/m(2)) (FOLFIRI) or first-line FOLFOX6 and second-line FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was administered every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was done centrally using minimisation (minimisation factors were WHO performance status, previous adjuvant chemotherapy, number of disease sites, and centre) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival after two lines of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were by intention-to-treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00126256 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 205 patients were randomly assigned to the sequential group and 205 to the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>161 (79%) patients in the sequential group and 161 (79%) in the combination group died during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival after two lines was 10·5 months (95% CI 9·6-11·5) in the sequential group and 10·3 months (9·0-11·9) in the combination group (hazard ratio 0·95, 95% CI 0·77-1·16; p=0·61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> caused by toxic effects of treatment occurred in the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During first-line chemotherapy, significantly fewer severe (grade 3-4) haematological adverse events (12 events in 203 patients in sequential group vs 83 events in 203 patients in combination group; p&lt;0·0001) and non-haematological adverse events (26 events vs 186 events; p&lt;0·0001) occurred in the sequential group than in the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Upfront combination chemotherapy is more toxic and is not more effective than the sequential use of the same cytotoxic drugs in patients with advanced, non-resectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
