<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic phospholipase A(2)α (cPLA(2)α) up-regulation has been reported in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, thus we aimed to elucidate its role in the proliferation of the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line, HT-29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EGF caused a rapid activation of cPLA(2)α which coincided with a significant increase in cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of cPLA(2)α activity by pyrrophenone or by antisense oligonucleotide against cPLA(2)α (AS) or inhibition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)) production by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> resulted with inhibition of cell proliferation, that was restored by addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secreted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) activated both protein kinase A (PKA) and PKB/Akt pathways via the EP2 and EP4 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Either, the PKA inhibitor (H-89) or the PKB/Akt inhibitor (Ly294002) caused a partial inhibition of cell proliferation which was restored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But, inhibited proliferation in the presence of both inhibitors could not be restored by addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AS or H-89, but not Ly294002, inhibited CREB activation, suggesting that CREB activation is mediated by PKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AS or Ly294002, but not H-89, decreased PKB/Akt activation as well as the nuclear localization of β-catenin and cyclin D1 and increased the plasma membrane localization of β-catenin with E-cadherin, suggesting that these processes are regulated by the PKB pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Caco-2 cells exhibited cPLA(2)α dependent proliferation via activation of both PKA and PKB/Akt pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings suggest that the regulation of HT-29 proliferation is mediated by cPLA(2)α-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)via EP induces CREB phosphorylation by the PKA pathway and regulates β-catenin and cyclin D1 cellular localization by PKB/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
