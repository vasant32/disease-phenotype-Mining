<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurotrophin receptors were initially identified in neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were recently detected in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in association with invasiveness, but the function of these tyrosine kinase receptors was not previously investigated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: We report herein that human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines synthesize the neural growth factor Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) under stress conditions (serum starvation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells expressed high- (TrkB) and low-affinity (p75(NTR)) receptors at the plasma membrane, whereas TrkA and TrkC, two other high affinity receptors for NGF and NT-3, respectively, were undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that BDNF induced cell proliferation and had an anti-apoptotic effect mediated through TrkB, as assessed by K252a, a Trk pharmacologic inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It suppressed both cell proliferation and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells that do not express TrkA nor TrkC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In parallel to the increase of BDNF secretion, sortilin, a protein acting as a neurotrophin transporter as well as a co-receptor for p75(NTR), was increased in the cytoplasm of primary and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, which suggests that sortilin could regulate neurotrophin transport in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, pro-BDNF, also detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, was co-expressed with p75(NTR) at the cell membrane and co-localized with sortilin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to BDNF, exogenous pro-BDNF induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which suggests that a counterbalance mechanism is involved in the control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell survival, through sortilin as the co-receptor for p75(NTR), the high affinity receptor for pro-neurotrophins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, we show that BDNF and TrkB transcripts (and not p75(NTR)) are overexpressed in the patients' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by comparison with their adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, notably in advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results highlight that BDNF and TrkB are essential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell growth and survival in vitro and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This autocrine loop could be of major importance to define new targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
