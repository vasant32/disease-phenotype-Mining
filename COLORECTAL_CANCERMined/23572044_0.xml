<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analysed for a cohort of participants from the general practice research database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Empirical estimates informed a Markov model that included five long-term conditions (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simulations compared an intervention promoting physical activity in healthy adults with standard care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intervention effect on physical activity was from a meta-analysis of randomised trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual cost of intervention, in the base case, was one family practice consultation per participant year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was net health benefit in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cohort of 262,704 healthy participants entered the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intervention was associated with an increase in life years lived free from physical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With 5 years intervention the increase was 52 (95 % interval -11 to 115) per 1,000 participants entering the model (probability increased 91.9 %); with 10 years intervention the increase was 102 (42-164) per 1,000 (probability 99.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Net health benefits at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY were 3.2 (-11.1 to 16.9) QALYs per 1,000 participants with 5 years intervention (probability cost-effective 64.7 %) and 5.0 (-9.5 to 19.3) with 10 years intervention (probability cost-effective 72.4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A universal strategy to promote physical activity in primary care has the potential to increase life years lived free from physical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is only weak evidence that a universal intervention strategy might prove cost-effective </plain></SENT>
