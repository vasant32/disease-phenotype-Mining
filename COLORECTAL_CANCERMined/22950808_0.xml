<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lower concentrations of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and elevated concentrations of insulin or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> have been associated with an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However few studies have evaluated IGFBP-1 and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in relation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath>, the only known precursor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between November 2001 and December 2002, we examined associations between circulating concentrations of insulin, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, IGFBP-1 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> among 190 individuals with one or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> and 488 with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> using logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individuals with the highest concentrations of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were more likely to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-4.0) than those with the lowest concentrations; associations that appeared to be stronger in men (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.7-10.9) than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with high insulin concentrations also had a higher risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.7-7.4), whereas higher levels of IGFBP-1 were associated with a reduced risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in men only (OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with higher C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels (&gt;1(st) Q) were at increased risk for lower <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-7.1), an association that remained strong in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men (OR = 6.3, 95% CI 1.0-36.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of IGFBP-1 in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals were associated with a reduced risk of low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Associations between these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> index in overweight and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals, suggest that the mechanism by which C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> could induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> may include its anti-apoptotic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and IGF hormones predict <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> risk, and that outcomes associated with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> maybe modified by gender </plain></SENT>
