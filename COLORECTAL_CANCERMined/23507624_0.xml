<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) release due to sympathetic activation leads to a Th2 deviation via the beta-2 adrenergic receptor Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β-2AR) and could increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study intends to determine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (ISO; beta-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> (PRO; beta-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) on the production of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytokine levels have been examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The β-2AR expression on lymphocyte subsets was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, TILs were isolated from fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue and patient PBMCs were obtained just prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells were cultured in medium for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, cells were stimulated with 10 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) alone or in the presence of either 1 µmol/L of PRO or 1 µmol/L ISO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concentration of cytokines in the supernatants was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three-color flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of β-2AR on the lymphocyte subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed via paired or independent t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17 were elevated after PHA-stimulation of PBMCs and TILs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the elevation of IFN-γ and IL-17 production by TILs in response to PHA was significantly lower than PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the presence of ISO, the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, but this reduction was very low in TILs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the effects of PRO on cytokine production were, at least partially, comparable to those of ISO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Depressed levels of β-2AR expression were demonstrated on CD4+IFN-γ+ and CD4+IL-17+ lymphocytes in patients' PBMCs and TILs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the effects of ISO and PRO on cytokine production by TILs and determined β-2AR expression on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>ISO failed to induce a shift toward the expected Th2 cytokine profile in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients' TILs, which might be due to the downregulation of β-2AR expression on TILs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in this study, PRO induced a shift to a Th2 profile in PBMCs </plain></SENT>
