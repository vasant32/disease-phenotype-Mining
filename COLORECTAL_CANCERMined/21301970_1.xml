<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although often proposed as a means to reduce the harmful consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spill, water lavage has yet to be systematically evaluated in relevant in vitro and in vivo models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the mechanisms and utility of a single water lavage to improve the sequelae of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spill during laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> cell susceptibility to water-induced osmotic lysis was characterized in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reproducible model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spill was established to recapitulate water or saline lavage during laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volumes calculated from noninvasive imaging were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volumes and survival of mice treated with water, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, or sham laparotomy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant osmotic lysis of cultured murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells was observed after a brief exposure to water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to saline or sham laparotomy, water lavage demonstrated superior clinical outcomes with a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and concomitant improvement in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of water lavage during oncologic surgeries to reduce the sequelae of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> spill is justified and strongly supported by our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data from our study raise several concerns regarding the mechanisms and efficacy of saline lavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the use of water lavage during laparotomy would be anticipated to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031142" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peritoneal disease</z:e> burden with minimal toxicity or cost </plain></SENT>
