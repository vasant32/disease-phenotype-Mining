<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used purified, recombinant proteins to evaluate the functional impacts of the R228H, E488G, V511A and G587R PGHS-2 polymorphisms on COX activity, fatty acid selectivity and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PGHS-2, COX activity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi> was ∼20% lower in 488G and ∼20% higher in 511A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variants showed time-dependent inhibition by the COX-2-specific inhibitor (coxib) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi>, but 488G and 511A had 30-60% higher residual COX activity; 511A also showed up to 70% higher residual activity with other time-dependent inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 488G and 511A differed significantly from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> in Vmax values with the two fatty acids: 488G showed ∼20% less and 511A showed ∼20% more discrimination against eicosapentaenoic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Vmax value for eicosapentaenoate was not affected in 228H or 587R, nor were the Km values or the COX activation efficiency (with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32395">arachidonate</z:chebi>) significantly altered in any variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the E488G and V511A PGHS-2 polymorphisms may predict who will most likely benefit from interventions with some <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> or n-3 fatty acids </plain></SENT>
