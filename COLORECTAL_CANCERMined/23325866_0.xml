<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Series of nested case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: General practices in the United Kingdom contributing to the QResearch primary care database (660) and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) (643) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged â‰¥ 50 with a diagnosis of a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> in 1997-2011, each matched with up to five controls by age, sex, practice, and calendar year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios for incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> (colorectal, oesophageal, gastric) and use of bisphosphonates, adjusted for smoking status, ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 20,106 and 19,035 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases, 5364 and 5135 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> cases, and 3155 and 3157 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> were identified from QResearch and CPRD, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall bisphosphonate use (at least one prescription) was not associated with risk of colorectal, oesophageal, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> in either database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for QResearch and CPRD were 0.97 (0.79 to 1.18) and 1.18 (0.97 to 1.43) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e>; 1.12 (0.87 to 1.44) and 0.79 (0.62 to 1.01) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>; and 1.03 (0.94 to 1.14) and 1.10 (1.00 to 1.22) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses showed no difference between types of bisphosphonate for risk of oesophageal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2567">alendronate</z:chebi> use was associated with an increased risk (1.47, 1.11 to 1.95; P=0.008), but only in data from the QResearch database and without any association with duration and with no definitive confirmation from sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series of population based case-control studies in two large primary care databases, exposure to bisphosphonates was not associated with an increased risk of common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
