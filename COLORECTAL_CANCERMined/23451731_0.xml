<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, results from these studies have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to review and summarize the evidence provided by longitudinal studies on the association between BP use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive literature search for articles published up to October 2012 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to performing a meta-analysis, the studies were evaluated for publication bias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative risk (RR) or odds ratios (OR) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six reports (4 case-control studies and two cohort studies), published between 2010 and 2012 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of an association between any use of BP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk using fixed-effects model (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.85), and the random-effects model (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.71, 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we did not observe any evidence of a trend with increasing duration of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that there is evidence of an association between any use of BP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
