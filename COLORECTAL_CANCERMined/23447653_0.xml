<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretherapeutic assessment consists of hepatic angiography and (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin ((99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) perfusion scintigraphy to estimate the liver-to-lung shunt and exclude extrahepatic (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the predictive value of intratumoral (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred four patients with chemotherapy-refractory liver-dominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were treated with (90)Y radioembolization between December 2006 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients underwent angiographic assessment and perfusion scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> before lobar (90)Y radioembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For inclusion, patients must have undergone pretherapeutic and follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (6 wk and 3 mo after radioembolization, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of intratumoral (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake was rated, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were classified according to changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter on both an individual and a patient basis using Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> (RECIST) 1.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response at both time points, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake, and catheter position were then statistically analyzed in a linear and generalized linear mixed model at a significance level of 0.05 (P value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with a total of 435 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (mean number of lesions ± SD, 6.6 ± 2.8; mean lesion size ± SD, 33.8 ± 21.2 mm; lesion size range, 10-154 mm) were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the patient-based analysis, 3 patients had partial response, 49 stable disease, and 6 progressive disease after 6 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 3 mo, 5 patients showed partial response, 26 stable disease, and 17 progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no association of patient-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response with overall (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake (P = 0.172) or with catheter position (P = 0.6456) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an interaction effect of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake and catheter position in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response was not found (P = 0.512) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in lesion-based analysis according to RECIST 1.1 there was no association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response with degree of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake, catheter position, or interaction of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake and catheter position (P = 0.339, 0.593, and 0.658, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Response to (90)Y radioembolization was found to be independent of the degree of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, therapy should not be withheld from patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> lacking intratumoral (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
