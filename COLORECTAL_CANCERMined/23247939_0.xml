<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Guidelines from the United Kingdom and the United States on risk stratification after polypectomy differ, as do recommended surveillance intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare risk for advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at 1-year colonoscopy among patients cross-classified by U.S. and U.K. surveillance guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Pooled analysis of 4 prospective studies between 1984 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic and private clinics in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 3226 postpolypectomy patients with 6- to 18-month follow-up colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Rates of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> â‰¥1 cm, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, &gt;25% villous architecture, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancer</z:e>) at 1 year, compared across U.S. and U.K. risk categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was detected 1 year after polypectomy in 3.8% (95% CI, 2.7% to 4.9%) of lower-risk patients and 11.2% (CI, 9.8% to 12.6%) of higher-risk patients by U.S. criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to U.K. criteria, 4.4% (CI, 3.3% to 5.4%) of low-risk patients, 9.9% (CI, 8.3% to 11.5%) of intermediate-risk patients, and 18.7% (CI, 14.8% to 22.5%) of high-risk patients presented with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; U.K. high-risk patients comprised 12.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> U.S. lower-risk patients were low-risk by U.K. criteria; however, more patients were classified as low-risk, because the U.K. guidelines do not consider histologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher-risk U.S. patients were distributed across the 3 U.K. categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 26.3% were reclassified by the U.K. criteria to a higher-risk category and 7.0% to a lower-risk category, with a net 19.0% benefiting from detection 2 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, substitution of U.K. for U.S. guidelines resulted in an estimated 0.03 additional colonoscopy every 5 years per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Patients were enrolled 15 to 20 years ago, and quality measures for colonoscopy were unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients lacking follow-up colonoscopy or with surveillance colonoscopy after 6 to 18 months and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or insufficient baseline <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> characteristics were excluded (2076 of 5302) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Application of the U.K. guidelines in the United States could identify a subset of high-risk patients who may warrant a 1-year clearing colonoscopy without substantially increasing rates of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
