<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) may relieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> to permit elective resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> presenting as an emergency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been concerns regarding the oncological consequences of this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated outcomes in patients with potentially curable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with a SEMS as a bridge to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in whom a SEMS procedure was attempted between January 2004 and August 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Palliative SEMS procedures were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes for SEMS insertion and subsequent surgery were recorded with a focus on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SEMS insertion was attempted and achieved in 34 patients, of whom 30 were discharged after successful relief of obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, five patients needed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> surgery within 18 days owing to insufficient relief of obstruction (1), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (3) or caecal (1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, with one postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remainder underwent elective surgery with no postoperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 28 of 34 patients were stoma free after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 34 patients was 74 (95 per cent confidence interval 53 to 86) per cent after a median follow-up of 33Â·7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A curative outcome was achieved in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although associated with significant short-term problems, a SEMS can be useful in converting an emergency into an elective situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No adverse oncological consequences were identified </plain></SENT>
