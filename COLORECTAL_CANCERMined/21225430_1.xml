<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasia</z:hpo> cells exfoliated from colorectal epithelium have dysfunctional apoptotic mechanisms, thus it is possible to identify high-molecular weight DNA fragments in feces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective single-center study was performed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of fecal-based DNA integrity versus immunological fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) and calprotectin for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Feces were collected from 204 subjects and DNA integrity was quantified by quantitative-denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (QdHPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calprotectin and iFOBT were assessed using commercial kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic performance was calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 192 fecal specimens were analyzed and 12 samples were excluded due to DNA degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found long DNA (L-DNA) occurrence in feces with a sensitivity of 86% (n = 24/28) and a specificity of 81% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To minimize false-positive cases of the developed test, area under the curve of ROC was evaluated such that the specificity was increased to 92% with decreased sensitivity to 79%, p = 0.0001 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>iFOBT was positive in 51% (n = 14/27) while calprotectin was positive in 75% (n = 18/27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of iFOBT and L-DNA identified a greater number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 95%, p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination also improved the sensitivity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, particularly high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (33%, p = 0.0015) as opposed to a single evaluation assay (17-21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the usefulness of fecal DNA integrity assay by QdHPLC as a non-invasive, easy-to-perform, and reproducible method with a high level of sensitivity in detecting individuals with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combination of iFOBT and L-DNA improves the sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection </plain></SENT>
