<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clarifying whether there is a biological difference between the two groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> or their primaries could have important clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic review was performed using the following resources: MEDLINE from PubMed (1950 to present), Embase, Cochrane and the Web of Knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review demonstrated that the majority of studies found differences in molecular marker expression between colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and their respective primaries in both the synchronous and metachronous groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies investigating genetic aberrations demonstrated that the majority of changes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> were 'maintained' in the colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A limited number of studies compared the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> of the synchronous and metachronous groups and generally demonstrated no differences in marker expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there were conflicting results, the colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in the synchronous and metachronous groups demonstrated some differences in keeping with a more aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> subtype in the synchronous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review suggests that biological differences may exist between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of the synchronous and metachronous groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether there are biological differences between the primaries of the synchronous and metachronous groups remains undetermined due to the limited number of studies available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future research is required to determine whether differences exist between the two groups and should include comparisons of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
