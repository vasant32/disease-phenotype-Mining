<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High coverage of the target population represents the most important factor in determining their success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This systematic review aimed at assessing the effectiveness of population-based screening programs in increasing coverage compared to spontaneous access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic databases and national and regional websites were searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies on interventions aimed at increasing screening participation published between 1999 and 2009; for those published before, we consulted the Jepson et al. review (2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared spontaneous access (including no intervention) vs population-based screening programs actively inviting the target population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the latter, we compared GP-based vs invitation letter-based interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The invitation letter vs no intervention showed significantly more participation (RR=1.60 95%CI 1.33-1.92; RR=1.52 95%CI 1.28-1.82; RR=1.15 95%CI 1.12-1.19, for breast, cervical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screenings, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GP-based interventions, although more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, showed a significant effect when compared with no intervention for breast (RR=1.74 95%CI 1.25-2.43), but not for cervical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between invitation letter-based and GP-based organization (RR=0.99 95%CI 0.94-1.05; RR=1.08 95%CI 0.99-1.17, for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Population-based programs are more effective than spontaneous screening in obtaining higher testing uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both invitation letter-based and GP-based programs are effective </plain></SENT>
