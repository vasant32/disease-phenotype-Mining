<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though several biomarkers are in use in diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, they are marred by limited specificity and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) gene is a member of the human tissue kallikrein family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because prostate specific antigen (PSA), the best biomarker for detecting and monitoring <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, is a member of this family, many other members, including KLK10, have been widely examined as novel biomarkers for different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, KLK10 has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker for <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinoma</z:mp>, while its methylation on exon 3 has been proposed as a prognostic marker for early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyse KLK10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and examine its prognostic value and potential clinical application as a novel molecular tissue biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 190 colorectal samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from pulverised tissues and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KLK10 was amplified by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B2M was used as a reference gene and HT-29 cells as positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KLK10 expression was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> of advanced TNM and Duke's stage showed high KLK10 expression status (P=0.036; P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with high KLK10 expression had a shorter disease-free and overall survival rates (P=0.014; P=0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KLK10 may serve as a new marker of unfavourable prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
