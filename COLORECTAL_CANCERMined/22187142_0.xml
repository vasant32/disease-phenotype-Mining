<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> detected on repeat colonoscopy in relation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) frequency reported during the previous baseline examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2003 until December 2008, patients had a colonoscopy with an ACF study using a magnifying colonoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distal 20 cm section of colon was sprayed with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">Methylene Blue</z:chebi> to ascertain the ACF frequency, the independent variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into low and high ACF count using the median as the cut point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected from consenting patients included age, gender, height, weight, ethnicity, smoking history, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), and personal history of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A follow-up colonoscopy was performed at an interval as dictated by clinical surveillance guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was surveillance detected advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (SDAN) detected on repeat colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic Regression was used to calculate risk of SDAN on repeat colonoscopy in relation to baseline ACF count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 74 patients had a baseline ACF exam and a repeat surveillance colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median ACF was six and thus a high ACF count was &gt;6 ACF and a low ACF count was â‰¤6 ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed with SDAN were more likely to have had a high ACF number at baseline compared to patients without these lesions at follow-up (adjusted odds ratio = 12.27; 95% confidence interval: 2.00-75.25) controlling for age, sex, smoking, history of prior <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and time interval to surveillance exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A sub analysis of our results demonstrated that this relationship was observed in 48 patients who were undergoing a surveillance colonoscopy for a previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and not those receiving surveillance for a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased number of ACF in the distal colorectum was independently associated with substantial risk for future advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This relationship was observed in patients undergoing surveillance for previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, ACF may serve as potential biomarkers in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> to help identify patients who may need additional surveillance </plain></SENT>
