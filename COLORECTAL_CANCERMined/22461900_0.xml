<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The 7th edition of AJCC staging manual implicitly states that only T1 and T2 lesions that lack regional lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> but have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposit(s) will be classified in addition as N1c, though it is not consistent in that pN1c is also an option for pT3/T4a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the staging table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in this TNM classification, how to classify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits (TDs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (LNM) and TDs simultaneously is still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of counting TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in TNM classification and to identify its prognostic value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, 513 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with LNM were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We proposed a novel pN (npN) category in which TDs were counted as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-specific survival according to the npN or pN category was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Harrell's C statistic was used to test the predictive capacity of the prognostic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that the TD was a significant prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses uniformly indicated that the npN category was significantly correlated with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of Harrell's C statistical analysis demonstrated that the npN category exhibited a superior predictive capacity compared to the pN category of the 7th edition TNM classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we also found no significant prognostic differences in patients with or without TD in the same npN categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The counting of TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification system is potentially superior to the classification in the 7th edition of the TNM staging system to assess prognosis and survival for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
