<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated a spiritually based approach to increasing Health Belief Model-based pre-screening outcomes in a Community Health Advisor-led intervention conducted in African American churches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen urban churches were randomized to receive either the spiritually based intervention or a nonspiritual comparison of the same structure and core <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trained Community Health Advisors led a series of two educational sessions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The educational sessions were delivered over a 1-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants (N = 316) completed a baseline survey at enrollment and a follow-up survey one month after the first session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both interventions resulted in significant pre/post increases in knowledge, perceived benefits of screening, and decreases in perceived barriers to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among women, the spiritually based intervention resulted in significantly greater increases in perceived benefits of screening relative to the nonspiritual comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding was marginal in the sample as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, perceived benefits to screening were associated with behavioral intention for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in this population, the spiritually based was generally as effective as the nonspiritual (secular) communication </plain></SENT>
