<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dose of 180 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 was administered to 6 patients by 60 min hepatic intra-arterial infusion (HAI) via a surgically implanted Port-a-CathÂ® system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from 0 to 360 min after start of HAI, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 plus metabolites were analysed by a selective reversed phase HPLC method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the extent to which SN-38 is generated after HAI of irinotecan given at a low dose of 180 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second investigation, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 was administered via conventional intravenous infusion (dose 180 mg/m(2), 60 min infusion time, 11 patients) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 plus metabolites were quantified using identical analytical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to i.v. infusion, the pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 and SN-38 were altered by HAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean c(max) of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 after HAI was reduced by 37%, whereas the mean c(max) of SN-38 increased by 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HAI resulted in a desired, increased metabolic conversion of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 into SN-38 and might improve the regional availability of the pharmacologic active metabolite SN-38 at the site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of the metabolites SN-38 glucuronide and APC remained unaffected by the route of administration </plain></SENT>
