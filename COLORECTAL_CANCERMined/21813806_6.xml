<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A higher <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake is associated with a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in observational studies, but recent evidence suggests that excessive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> supplementation may increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in some individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mandatory <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> fortification of grain products in the United States may have unintended negative consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, including 8.5 y of postfortification follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We examined the association between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study-a US cohort study of 525,488 individuals aged 50-71 y initiated in 1995-1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary, supplemental, and total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intakes were calculated for the pre- and postfortification periods (before and after 1 July 1997) based on a baseline food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRs and 95% CIs were calculated by using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up through 31 December 2006 (mean follow-up: 9.1 y), 7212 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the postfortification analysis (6484 cases), a higher total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake was associated with a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (HR for ≥900 compared with &lt;200 μg/d: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest intakes specifically from supplements (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.92) or from diet (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.97) were also protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pattern of associations was similar for the prefortification period, and no significant differences between time periods were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort study that included 8.5 y of postfortification follow-up, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake was associated with a decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence may take ≥10 y, additional follow-up time is needed to fully examine the effect of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> fortification </plain></SENT>
