<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional polymorphism MKK4 -1304T&gt;G has been showed to be protective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that genetic variants in the MKK4 promoter were associated with the risk of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two common polymorphisms in MKK4, -1304T&gt;G and -1044A&gt;T were genotyped in two independent case-control panels of Eastern and Southern Chinese populations, totally containing 1237 NPC and 1328 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that compared to the most common -1304TT genotype, carriers of variant genotypes (-1304TG+GG) were associated with a significantly reduced risk for NPC in total subjects (adjusted OR = 0.78; 95%CI = 0.67-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further stratification analysis showed that the protective effect was more pronounced in EBV negative status (adjusted OR = 0.51; 95%CI = 0.41-0.68) but restrained in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> (adjusted OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 0.88-1.26), and that the -1304GG variant genotypes interacted with EBV negative status on reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant association was observed between the -1044A&gt;T polymorphism and risk of NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the protective role of genetic variant MKK4 -1304T&gt;G is restrained in NPC with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate the role of EBV and MKK4 -1304 T&gt;G interaction as a causative factor for the NPC </plain></SENT>
