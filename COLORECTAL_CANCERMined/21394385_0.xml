<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The IC53 gene was reported to be upregulated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the expression level of IC53 is positively correlated with the grade and depth of invasion in <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injection of IC53 stably transfected HCT-116 cells into athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice promoted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of IC53 increased cell invasive growth, which could be dramatically prevented by knocking down IC53 with siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of IC53 on cell-invasive growth were mediated by upregulation of integrins, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphorylation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2737 in the IC53 gene created a potential microRNA379 target site, and microRNA379 expression inhibited IC53 translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 222 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the C/C rs2737 genotype was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (median age 63.0 versus 55.3 years, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the C/C rs2737 genotype was much lower in patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> below the age of 45 years than in individuals over age 45 years (10.8% versus 26.6%, P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that IC53 is a positive mediator for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> progression, and IC53-rs2737 may serve as protection from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
