<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five thousand patients who had received treatment for breast, prostate, lung, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at the L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec were solicited by mail to take part in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 1,984 (39.7%) agreed to complete a battery of questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 22.6% of the patients were currently consuming hypnotic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with a greater utilization of hypnotic medication were older age, greater difficulties initiating sleep, more stressful life events experienced in the past 6 months, higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, past or current psychological difficulties, poorer role functioning, less severe urinary symptoms, greater use of opioids, and past or current chemotherapy treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with those of previous studies conducted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients in showing high rates of hypnotic medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this study identified several factors that might help identify persons at risk of using this type of medication and, therefore, to experience the potential negative effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="35717">hypnotics</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
