<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cohort study investigated the frequency of radiological abnormalities at the site of a closed diverting loop ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in whom an ileostomy was raised and later closed during a 5-year period formed the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surveillance computed tomography (CT) was undertaken the images were scrutinized and graded as to defined anatomical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine patients had an ileostomy, of which 92 were diverting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine (64%) were closed at various intervals (median time to closure 6 (2-22) months and 43 underwent a surveillance CT at 1-3 (median 2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 year an abnormality (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or defect) at the site of closure was seen in 16 (37%) CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were more frequent with increasing duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> was detected at 2 years but there was no deterioration in the abdominal wall at 3 years when compared with that at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormalities in the abdominal wall at the site of a closed diverting ileostomy are common but true <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The routine use of prophylactic mesh at ileostomy closure may be unnecessary </plain></SENT>
