<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, high densities of TILs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> are associated with good prognosis independent of other prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic role of TILs in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lesions is unknown, as is their role in response or resistance to conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the association of TIL densities at the invasive margin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> with response to chemotherapy and progression-free survival in a set of 101 large section samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-resolution automated microscopy on complete tissue sections was used to objectively generate cell densities for CD3, CD8, granzyme B, or FOXP3 positive immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A predictive scoring system using TIL densities was developed in a training set and tested successfully in an independent validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TIL densities at the invasive margin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> allowed the prediction of response to chemotherapy with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of high density values with longer progression-free survival under chemotherapy was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these findings extend the impact of the local immune response on the clinical course from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> also to metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because detailed quantification of TILs in metastatic lesions revealed a strong association with chemotherapy efficacy and prognosis, we suggest that the developed scoring system may be used as a predictive tool for response to chemotherapy in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
