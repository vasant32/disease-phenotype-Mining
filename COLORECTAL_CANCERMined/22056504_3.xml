<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The increasing prevalence of adolescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> affects adult health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of adolescent overweight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence in a large cohort of males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Body mass index (BMI) was measured in 1.1 million Jewish Israeli males who underwent a general health examination at ages 16 to 19 between 1967 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overweight was defined as BMI ≥ 85th percentile of the standard U.S. distribution in adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> was identified by linkage with the Israel National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry up to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 17.6 ± 10.9 years, reflecting 19.5 million person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards modeling was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of adolescent overweight increased from 9.9% to 16.8% in the first 10 and last 10 annual examination cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colon (n = 445) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (n = 193) cases were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overweight predicted an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> [HR = 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.02, P = 0.002] but not of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (HR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.38-1.73, P = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk was greatest for nonmucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon (HR = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.26-2.23, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of BMI ≥ 85th percentile with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was even more pronounced in analyses that were restricted to men followed until at least 40 years of age [N = 367,478; HR = 1.75 (95% CI, 1.33-2.3, P &lt; 0.001)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent overweight is substantially associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> incidence in young to middle-aged adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: These long-term sequelae add to the urgency to seriously address increasing childhood and adolescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with its attendant increasing population impact </plain></SENT>
