<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy is indicated as adjuvant treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> as well as hypoxic and inflammatory lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory effect of HBO2 could reduce colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 48 Wistar rats were randomly divided into the following groups: * G1 - control; * G2 - HBO2 treatment; * G3 - 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) injection only; * G4 - DMH injection and HBO2 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These groups were further randomly divided into two subgroups: a. euthanasia at six weeks; and. b. euthanasia at 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals belonging to G2 and G4 were subjected to 15 HBO2 sessions, performed every 24 hours at 2.0 atm absolute pressure, 90 minutes each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was induced via intraperitoneal injection of DMH in G3 and G4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> index (ACFi), the cell nuclear antigen index (PCNA) and the cyclooxygenase-2 index (iCOX-2) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After DMH administration, ACFi increased and was higher in subgroups euthanized at six weeks than in those sacrificed at 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HBO2 alone (G2) did not affect ACFi (p &gt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger increases of PCNA were detected in G2 versus G3 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison between G4 and control group mice revealed no differences in PCNA (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>COX-2 was overexpressed in G3 (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to G4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: COX-2 expression was "induced" by DMH and reverted to a "wild"-type level of expression upon exposure to HBO2 </plain></SENT>
