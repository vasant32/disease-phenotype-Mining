<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">Pyridoxine</z:chebi> is frequently used to treat <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> (HFS), although the evidence of benefit is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a randomised placebo-controlled trial to determine whether <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi> could avoid the need for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose modifications and improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 106 patients planned for palliative single-agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (53 in each arm, 65%/35% colorectal/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>) were randomised to receive either concomitant <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi> (50 mg po) or matching placebo three times daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with placebo, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi> use was associated with an increased rate of avoiding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose modifications (37% vs 23%, relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.29, 1.20, P=0.15) and fewer grade 3/4 HFS-related adverse events (9% vs 17%, odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.15-1.6, P=0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">pyridoxine</z:chebi> did not improve response rate or progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="16709">Pyridoxine</z:chebi> may reduce the need for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> dose modifications and the incidence of severe HFS, but does not impact on antitumour effect </plain></SENT>
