<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial community that can reach levels as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These microorganisms are essential to a host's well-being in terms of nutrition and mucosa immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, numerous studies have also implicated members of the colonic microbiota in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> involves a genetic component where damaged DNA and genetic instability initiates a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, environmental factors can also contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, considering the constant exposure of the colonic mucosa to the microbiome and/or its metabolites, the mucosa has long been proposed to contribute to colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanistic details of these associations remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, due to technical and conceptual advances, progress in characterizing the taxonomic composition, metabolic capacity, and immunomodulatory activity of human gut microbiota have been made, thereby elucidating its role in human health and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the use of experimental animal models and clinical/epidemiological studies of environmental etiological factors has identified a correlation between gut microbiota composition and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bacteria continuously stimulate activated immunity in the gut mucosa and also contribute to the metabolism of bile and food components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the highest levels of carcinogen production are also associated with gut anaerobic bacteria and can be lowered with live lactobacilli supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this review, evidence regarding the relationship between microbiota and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> will be discussed, as well as the role for microbial manipulation in affecting disease development </plain></SENT>
