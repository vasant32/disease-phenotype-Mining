<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e>, the 30-day relative survival rose from 86% in 1977-1982 to 90% in 1995-1999, and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> it rose from 90% to 94% (I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from regional hospital discharge registries show that the overall 30-day mortality rates of colonic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> remained stable at about 11% and 4-5%, respectively, during 1985-2004 (II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratifying for urgency of surgery, but not for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> site, the 30-day mortality rate was 6.2% after elective surgery and 22.1% after emergency surgery in the period 2001-2008 according to DCCG data (17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the 30-day mortality was about twice as high in Denmark as in Norway, Sweden and Scotland, even if the data for these countries are older than the Danish data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates after palliative surgery are three times higher than the rates following curative surgery (115) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stage distribution at the time of diagnosis is more unfavourable in Denmark than in the other Nordic countries (114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of survival among countries is, however, encumbered by several methodological issues related to completeness, and data quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries, among others, biases the survival estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Like most western populations, the Danish population is ageing and the proportion of elderly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients aged &gt;75 years has therefore risen from 37% in 1977-1982 to 42% in 1995-1999 (III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disparity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment between elderly and younger patients exists on a number of counts, e.g., the former's curative resection rate is lower, their emergency presentation rate is higher and they are moreover more likely to present with later-stage disease than are younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in Denmark the curative resection rate among elderly patients aged &gt;75 years rose from 36% in 1977-1982 to 49% in 1995-1999 (III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This trend was paralleled by an increase in 30-day and 6-month relative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients aged &gt;70 years have a 30-day mortality rate of 13.1%, but their younger counterparts' mortality rate is only 3.5% (17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A mortality rate at least two to three times higher among the elderly than among younger patients has been reported repeatedly in various populations (95,96,116,127,128,130,131,135,136,144,145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In Denmark there is an inverse relationship between the comorbidity level and the resection rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the period 1995-2006, surgical treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> and severe comorbidity became progressively more aggressive, whereas surgical treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> apparently became more cautious or differentiated (VI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the overall 30-day mortality rate after resectional surgery remained stable at about 8% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> and at about 6% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Almost every fourth patient had severe comorbidity as determined by an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> of III or more and their 30-day mortality rate was at least 18% in 2001-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Any reduction in their short-term mortality will therefore have a substantial impact on the overall mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Despite the impact of comorbidity on postoperative mortality, the distinct seasonal variation seen in mortality from cardiovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e>, with excess mortality in the winter months, has not been observed in postoperative mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (VII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> was non-significantly higher in July than in other months of the year (VII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Evidence reveals a volume-outcome relationship regarding postoperative mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> (IV) and the most recent literature suggests that it probably also is so in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, volume may be a surrogate marker or proxy for other important structural factors such as quality and capacity of intensive care units, the availability of other clinical services like cardiac care units, multiple medical specialties, multidisciplinary infrastructure and nurse staffing, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality after emergency surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> was as high as 22% in 2001-2005 and mortality was significantly associated with the postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Patients developing medical complications had a mortality rate of 57.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days after surgery were age ≥ 71 years, male gender, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade ≥ III, palliative outcome, free or iatrogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, splenectomy, intraoperative surgical adverse events and postoperative medical complications (VIII) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate, however, may reach 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Even so, the mortality rate within 30 days after a SEMS attempt and later surgery may, irrespective of its timing, by very low (3%) relative to the mortality seen after emergency surgery (IX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The 5-year relative survival improved by 9% for both colonic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> from 1977-1982 to 1995-1999 (I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Further improvement has been observed and in 2004-2006, the 5-year relative survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> was 52% (95% CI 51-54) for men and 57% (95% CI 55-58) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> the corresponding percentages were 55% (95% CI 53-57) and 57% (95% CI 55-59) (202) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Overall, from 1977 until 2006, 1-year and 5-year survival increased almost 0.5-1% annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival has improved more in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> and survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surpassed that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> in the 2000s (202,204) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients aged &gt;75 years experienced a marked 13-16% increase in relative survival from 1977-1982 to 1995-1999, i.e., a period during which the rate of curative surgery increased pronouncedly among the elderly (III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The survival improvement among their younger counterparts in that period only reached 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was only excessive in the elderly during the first two years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In 1995-2006, about 30-43% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients had moderate and severe comorbidity as determined by a Charlson Comorbidity score of 1-2 and 3+, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>These comorbid patients had a long-term survival inferior to that of patients with no comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e>, the 5-year survival in 1998-2000 was 43% in patients with no comorbidity and only 20% in patients with severe comorbidity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Evidence repeatedly demonstrates a volume-outcome effect on long-term survival from colonic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> with improved survival being significantly associated with increasing hospital caseload and surgeon's education/specialty (V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In addition, the most recent evidence reveals that surgeon caseload may have a stronger impact on long-term survival than hospital volume which reflects the complexity in the interaction between hospital caseload and surgeon caseload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A total therapeutic delay ≥ 60 day has been shown to have a negative impact on the long-term survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, but not from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, given that stage is an intermediate step in the causal pathway between delay and survival (X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Neither provider delay ≥ 60 days, nor hospital delays ≥ 30 days or ≥ 60 days had any prognostic impact on long-term survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> is associated with an inferior long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> curative surgery in Denmark is 39% (16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, the use of SEMS as bridge to elective curative surgery makes it possible to achieve 3-year survival rates similar to those of 75% seen after elective curative surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> (IX) - despite an unexpectedly high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate </plain></SENT>
