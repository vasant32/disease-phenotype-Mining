<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the time-saving aspects of NBI techniques have not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study compared interpretation times between NBI and MCE techniques in distinguishing between neoplastic and non-neoplastic small colorectal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January and March 2010, 693 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the first lesion was detected by conventional white-light observation, the patient was randomly assigned to undergo a sequence of NBI and MCE observations (group A: NBI-MCE, group B: MCE-NBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time to diagnosis with each modality (NBI, from changing to NBI until diagnosis; MCE, from the start of indigo carmine solution spraying until diagnosis) was recorded by an independent observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the first modality used in each group (NBI or MCE) were assessed by referring to the histopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with 137 lesions were randomized to group A, and 80 patients with 163 lesions to group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median interpretation times were 12 s (interquartile range [IQR]: 7-19 s) in group A, and 17 s (IQR: 12-24 s) in group B, the difference being significant (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between NBI and MCE in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NBI reduces the interpretation times for distinguishing between neoplastic and non-neoplastic small lesions during colonoscopies, without loss of diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
