<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study identified silibinin, for the first time, as one such natural agent, having dual efficacy against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, silibinin rapidly induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> SW480 cells due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation with a concomitant dissipation of mitchondrial potential (ΔΨm) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release leading to mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as a biological effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, with increased exposure to silibinin, cytoplasmic vacuolization intensified within the cells followed by sequestration of the organelles, which inhibits the further release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this decrease in apoptotic response correlated with increased autophagic events as evidenced by tracking the dynamics of LC3-II within the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic studies revealed that silibinin strongly inhibited PIK3CA-AKT-MTOR but activated MAP2K1/2-MAPK1/3 pathways for its biological effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corroborating these effects, endoplasmic reticulum stress was generated and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake inhibition as well as energy restriction were induced by silibinin, thus, mimicking starvation-like conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, the cellular damage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells by silibinin was severe and irreparable due to sustained interference in essential cellular processes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> metabolism, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and protein synthesis, suggesting that silibinin harbors a deadly 'double-edged sword' against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells thereby further advocating its clinical effectiveness against this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
