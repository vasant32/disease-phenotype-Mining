<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pitx3, Otx2, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> were immunohistochemically localized in the upper brainstem of adult humans and mice and protein expression assessed using relative intensity measures and online microarray data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pitx3 was present and highly expressed in most <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, in our elderly subjects no Otx2 immunoreactivity was detected in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons, although Otx2 gene expression was found in younger cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhanced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> gene expression occurred in the substantia nigra, and higher amounts of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> protein characterized vulnerable ventral nigral <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data show that, at the age when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> typically occurs, there are no significant differences in the expression of transcription factors in brainstem <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons, but those most vulnerable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> rely more on the trophic factor receptor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> than other brainstem <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons </plain></SENT>
