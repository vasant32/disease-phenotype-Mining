<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hand-foot syndrome</z:e> (HFS) is a common adverse event that can be induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.) based chemotherapy can cause overexpression of COX-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and healthy tissue, which finally induced HFS in hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on this, we believed that a selected COX-2 inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals LLC) could ease HFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We designed a prospective clinical study to test the hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 2008 to January 2010, 110 patients with stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in the study and divided into 4 groups by random, but 9 patients did not finish at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were sixteen patients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> group, and fifteen patients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients were in XELOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatine</z:chebi>) group, and thirty-six patients in XELOX+ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 101 patients finished chemotherapy and follow-up interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The group that had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> had a significantly reduced frequency of  &gt;grade 1 hand-foot syndrome (29 vs. 72% P &lt; 0.001), and &gt;grade 2 (11.76% vs. 30% P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients experienced grade 3 HFS in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> group and only 1 patient had grade 3 HFS in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 5 patients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> group who refused to go on chemotherapy because of HFS, but there was none in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: From the result of this study, we could learn that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> could reduce HFS that was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So we recommend that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> can be used in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
