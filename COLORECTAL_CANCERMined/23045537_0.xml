<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of lay patient navigators on time to resolution and completion of follow-up testing among patients with abnormal screening tests in a medically underserved patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Denver Health, the safety-net health care system serving Denver, is one of 10 performance sites participating in the Patient Navigation Research Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 993 eligible subjects with abnormal screening tests randomized to navigation and no-navigation (control) arms and analyzed, 628 had abnormal breast screens (66 abnormal clinical breast examinations, 304 BIRADS 0, 200 BIRADS 3, 58 BIRADS 4 or 5) whereas 235 had abnormal colorectal and 130 had abnormal prostate screens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Time to resolution was significantly shorter in the navigated group (stratified log rank test, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient navigation improved diagnostic resolution for patients presenting with mammographic BIRADS 3 (P = 0.0003) and BIRADS 0 (P = 0.09), but not BIRADS 4/5 or abnormal breast examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Navigation shortened the time for both colorectal (P = 0.0017) and prostate screening resolution (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participant demographics included 72% minority, 49% with annual household income less than $10,000, and 36% uninsured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patient navigation positively impacts time to resolution of abnormal screening tests for breast, colorectal, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> in a medically underserved population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: By shortening the time to and increasing the proportion of patients with diagnostic resolution patient navigation could reduce disparities in stage at diagnosis and improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> outcomes </plain></SENT>
