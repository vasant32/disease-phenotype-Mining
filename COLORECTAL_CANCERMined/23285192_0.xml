<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While these drugs offer hope for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, their transient effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1658953" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor vasculature</z:e> is difficult to assess in clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel endoscopic imaging technology that enables histological examination of the gastrointestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of using CLE to image the vascular network in fresh biopsies of human colorectal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we have imaged <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant biopsy tissue samples and compared the vascular network parameters obtained with CLE with established histopathology techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh non-fixed biopsy samples of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant colorectal mucosa were stained with fluorescently labeled anti-CD31 antibodies and imaged by CLE using a dedicated endomicroscopy system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding biopsy samples underwent immunohistochemical staining for CD31, assessing the microvessel density (MVD) and vascular areas for comparison with CLE data, which were measured offline using specific software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The vessels were imaged by CLE in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average diameter of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels was 8.5±0.9 µm whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples it was 13.5±0.7 µm (p = 0.0049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular density was 188.7±24.9 vessels/mm(2) in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue vs. 242.4±16.1 vessels/mm(2) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples (p = 0.1201) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the immunohistochemistry samples, the MVD was 211.2±42.9/mm(2) and 351.3±39.6/mm(2) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant mucosa, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The vascular area was 2.9±0.5% of total tissue area for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and 8.5±2.1% for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective imaging of blood vessels with CLE is feasible in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> colorectal tissue by using fluorescently labeled antibodies targeted against an endothelial marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The method could be translated into the clinical setting for monitoring of anti-angiogenic therapy </plain></SENT>
