<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore conducting genome-scale methylation studies will enhance our understanding of the epigenetic etiology behind <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> by providing reliable biomarkers for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To discover novel hypermethylated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by genome-wide search, we first defined a subset of genes epigenetically reactivated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells after treatment with a demethylating agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, we identified another subset of genes with relatively down-regulated expression patterns in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing-adjacent regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 29Â genes obtained by cross-comparison of the two gene-sets, we subsequently selected, through stepwise subtraction processes, two novel genes, GABRA1 and LAMA2, as methylation targets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For clinical validation pyrosequencing was used to assess methylation in 134 matched tissue samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aberrant methylation at target CpG sites in GABRA1 and LAMA2 was observed with high frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues (92.5% and 80.6%, respectively), while less frequently in matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues (33.6% for GABRA1 and 13.4% for LAMA2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> were not significantly correlated with clinico-pathological features including age, sex, survival and TNM stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that ectopic overexpression of GABRA1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines resulted in strong inhibition of cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that two novel hypermethylated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, GABRA1 and LAMA2, may have roles in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and could be potential biomarkers for the screening and the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
