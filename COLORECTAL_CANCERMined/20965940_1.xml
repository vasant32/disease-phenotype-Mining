<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The phase I part assessed the maximum tolerated dose of FOLFIRI to determine the recommended doses of irinotecan and infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The doses were escalated from 150 to 180 mg/m(2) (irinotecan) and 2000 to 2400 mg/m(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1*6 and *28, and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan were observationally examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the phase II part, patients without the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1*28 allele received FOLFIRI at the recommended dose to evaluate safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 15 patients in the phase I part, dose-limiting toxicity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>) occurred in one patient who received 150 mg/m(2) irinotecan and 2400 mg/m(2) infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The respective recommended doses were 180 and 2400 mg/m(2) for irinotecan and infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, without reaching the maximum tolerated dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients received FOLFIRI at the recommended doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred in 44%, and Grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This phase I/II study demonstrates that the recommended doses of irinotecan and infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> in FOLFIRI for Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who do not possess the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1*28 allele are 180 and 2400 mg/m(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicities occurring at the recommended doses are manageable in these patients </plain></SENT>
