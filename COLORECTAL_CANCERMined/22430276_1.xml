<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Hepatic resection of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> is increasing, but evidence for the impact of surgery on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to describe comprehensively the impact of liver surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> on PROs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients selected for hepatic resection completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 and Quality of Life Questionnaire-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver Metastases</z:e> C21 before and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For functional scales, mean scores with 95% CIs were calculated at each time point, with differences in scores of at least 10 points considered clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses to symptom scales and items were categorized as minimal or severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportions and 95% CIs for each symptom category were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hepatic surgery was planned in 241 patients but abandoned in nine because of unresectable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 58 complications (25.2%), and 32 patients (14.9%) with disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Questionnaire compliance was excellent (&gt; 95% at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After surgery, most functional aspects of health decreased, and the proportions of patients with severe symptoms increased; role function deteriorated significantly, and 30% of patients reported severe activity/vigor problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional scales recovered by 6 months and were maintained at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative symptoms returned to baseline levels at 12 months, but 32.1% of patients reported severe problems with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> and 11.9% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings provide new evidence regarding outcomes of liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that patients be reassured that surgery has a minimal and short-lived detrimental impact on health </plain></SENT>
