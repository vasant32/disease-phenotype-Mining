<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e>, the debate continues over the efficacy of primary resection compared to chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to define the optimal management for asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients receiving elective surgery (n = 17) were compared to patients receiving chemotherapy only (n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data concerning patients' demographics, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, comorbidities, performance status, Child-Pugh score, extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, size of primary, and other secondary locations were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality after chemotherapy was lower than that after surgical resection (19.3% versus 29.4%; not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with &gt;75% hepatic involvement, mortality at 1 month was higher after receiving surgical treatment than after chemotherapy alone (50% versus 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with &lt;75% hepatic involvement, 30-day mortality was similar in both groups (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality in patients with Stage T3 was lower in those receiving chemotherapy (16.7% versus 30%; not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after elective surgery (2.1) was significantly higher than in patients receiving chemotherapy only (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that in palliative treatment of asymptomatic unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e>, the overall risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly higher after elective surgery compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in the literature, there is no substantial difference between these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New studies are required to better evaluate outcomes </plain></SENT>
