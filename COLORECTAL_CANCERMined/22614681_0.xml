<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As only patients with a major histopatholocial response benefit from this preoperative therapy, several <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> grading systems have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, currently no accepted comprehensive grading system for clinical use is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the impact of four histological regression grading systems in the neoadjuvant therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, 85 patients with locally advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological regression grading was evaluated using four classification systems: (1) grading system by the Japanese society of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, (2) grading system by Junker-Müller, (3) grading system by Dworak, (4) Cologne grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The four classification systems were analyzed for their prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following significant correlations were detected between the four classification systems and the ypTNM categories: (1) patients with a ypT3/4 category had significantly more often a worse histopathologic response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four grading systems (p = 0.001); (2) a ypN0 category was significantly correlated with good histopathologic response only in the Cologne grading system; (3) in the Junker-Müller and Dworak grading systems, a ypM0 category was significantly correlated with a good histopathologic response (p = 0.046; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, none of the used classification systems had a prognostic impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Currently, none of the analyzed histological regression grading systems is effective for clinical use </plain></SENT>
