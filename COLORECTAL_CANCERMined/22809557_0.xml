<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the practical feasibility to develop evidence on drug use and cost-effectiveness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Feasibility was examined using three Dutch case studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each case study investigated the degree of appropriate drug use and its incremental cost-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed data were retrospectively collected from hospital records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 391, 316 and 139 patients with stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> were included in 19, 29 and 42 hospitals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The methods used in the case studies were feasible to develop evidence on some aspects of drug use including types of treatments used, dosages, dose modifications and healthcare costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspects such as baseline patient characteristics, reasons to start or stop a treatment and treatment effects were less feasible because of missing values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite difficulties to correct for confounding by indication, it was possible to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness by synthesising evidence in two of the three case studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is possible to generate evidence about drug use and cost-effectiveness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practice to facilitate informed decision-making by both payers and physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This can improve quality of care and enhance the efficient allocation of resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal approach differs between drugs and their indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Generating high-quality evidence requires active interdisciplinary collaboration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patient registries can facilitate data collection but cannot resolve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In most circumstances it is inevitable to use data-synthesis to obtain valid incremental cost-effectiveness estimates, but for some indications it will not be feasible to derive a valid and precise estimate </plain></SENT>
