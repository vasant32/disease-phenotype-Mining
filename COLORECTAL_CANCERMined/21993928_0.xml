<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection of large lateral spreading <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> currently are technically limited by complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and disturbed large procedural sites, leading to incomplete resection and secondary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further technical improvements are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors previously demonstrated the effectiveness of a focused water jet for elevation of the lamina submucosa in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the first time, the clinical application of selective tissue elevation by pressure (STEP) for the treatment of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> as a prospective single-arm human trial is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This trial evaluated 59 patients who had primary colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with diameters exceeding 12 mm classified as 0-IIa or 0-IIb according to Paris classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A submucosal cushion was created with a flexible water jet applicator using the Helix HydroJet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was subsequently resected with a mucosal resection snare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The resected specimens were assessed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 59 patients underwent resection of 70 lesions with a maximum diameter of 80 mm (mean, 27 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Submucosal elevation with the water jet dissector was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and locations from the pectinate line to the ileocecal valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 70 lesions, 64 (91%) were resected completely in one session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the resected specimens were found to be <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (n = 2, 3%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with high-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (n = 24, 34%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with low-grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (n = 38, 54%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (n = 6, 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hemostasis during the resection was necessary in 24 cases (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This first clinical trial to analyze STEP technique demonstrated that STEP used to elevate large mucosal lesions in any location is feasible and facilitates EMR for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
