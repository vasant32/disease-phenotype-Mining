<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonpolypoid colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> might be a major contributor to the occurrence of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this case - control study was to compare the endoscopic appearance of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> and control individuals at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>.Patients and methods: The endoscopists at the Maastricht University Medical Center were first given training to ensure familiarity with the appearance and classification of nonpolypoid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> and patients at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent elective colonoscopy at the Center were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonpolypoid lesions were defined as lesions with a height of less than half the diameter, and advanced histology was defined as the presence of high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>.Results: A total of 59 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (mean age 48.7 years, 47.5 % men) and 590 matched controls (mean age 50.2 years, 47.5 % men) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were significantly more likely to be nonpolypoid than they were in controls: 43.3 % vs. 16.9 % (OR 3.60, 95 %CI 1.90 - 6.83; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was particularly true for proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>: 58.1 % vs. 16.3 % (OR 6.93, 95 %CI 2.92 - 16.40; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> containing advanced histology were more often nonpolypoid in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> than in controls (4/5, 80.0 % vs. 5/17, 29.4 %; P = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were also more often nonpolypoid in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> than in controls: 49.2 % vs. 20.4 % (OR 3.57, 95 %CI 1.91 - 6.68; P &lt; 0.001).Conclusions: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are more likely to have a nonpolypoid shape than those from average risk patients, especially in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that proficiency in recognition and endoscopic resection of nonpolypoid colorectal lesions are needed to ensure colonoscopic prevention against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in this high risk population </plain></SENT>
