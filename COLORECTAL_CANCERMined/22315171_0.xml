<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The samples of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> from 200 Chinese patients with follow-up were analyzed for the expression of CD133 and FHIT proteins by immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD133 was highly expressed in up to 42.0%(84/200) of this group of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 was significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (P=0.0001) and in adenomatous mucosas (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD133 positively corresponds to histological grade, clinical stage, regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024232" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic metastasis</z:e>, and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean overall survival time was shorter in patients with CD133 high expression than in those with CD133 low expression (P00.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 was inversely correlative with that of FHIT (r=-0.464, P=0.0001) in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD133 was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expression of CD133 may be inversely correlated with the expression of FHIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that CD133 may play an important role in the evolution of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and be considered as a potential marker for the prognosis </plain></SENT>
