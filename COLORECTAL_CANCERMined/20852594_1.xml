<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 126 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> was investigated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis to combine 13 routinely assessed clinicopathologic features and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five molecular markers recently suggested by Jass' classification to distinguish four molecular subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was assessed by a Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A clear separation into three prognostically significant groups was identified: cluster A and cluster C were associated with good prognosis and cluster B with poor prognosis (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic and molecular features of cluster A and cluster B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were strongly concordant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> profiles characterized by microsatellite instability or by <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathologic features of cluster C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were suggestive of a less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> than cluster B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetically, they appeared intermediate between cluster A and cluster B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, as they were mainly microsatellite stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showing high levels of both MGMT methylation and loss of heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>Chromosomal instability</z:mp> was significantly lower in cluster C than in cluster B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A more accurate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> classification should combine the prognostic power of clinicopathologic parameters with molecular biomarkers that provide information regarding the natural history of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical clustering seems to be a useful, promising and powerful tool for further translational studies and should lead us to define a diagnostic and prognostic signature for different <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
