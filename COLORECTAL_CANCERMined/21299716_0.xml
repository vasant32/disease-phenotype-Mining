<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed mechanisms regulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell activity have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that both full-length (f-Ad) and globular adiponectin (g-Ad) inhibited cell growth in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-containing medium, whereas it supported cell survival in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-deprived medium, with an increase in AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter effect of adiponectin in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation was significantly inhibited by adding autophagy inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi>, 3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> or a combination of pepstatin A and E-64d, suggesting that the effect of supporting cell growth was dependent, at least in part, on the induction of autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of autophagy was confirmed morphologically using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) fusion proteins under a fluorescence microscope using stably transfected DLD-1 cells expressing GFP-LC3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that adiponectin increased the expression of LC3-1, LC3-2, phosphorylated AMPKα and PPARα but decreased that of phosphorylated mTOR, insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1, phosphorylated serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-deprived medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that adiponectin supports cell survival in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation through enhancement of the autophagic machinery by AMPKα and PPARα activation and IGF-1/PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bimodal effects of adiponectin are thought to be clinically important in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
