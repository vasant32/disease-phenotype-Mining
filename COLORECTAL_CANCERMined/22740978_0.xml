<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the clinical significance of the concentration ratios of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> (SN-38G) and SN-38 in the plasma in predicting <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 gene were enrolled and treated with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 as part of the FOLFIRI regimen [<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 and fluorouracil (5-FU)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood was taken exactly 15 min following a 2-h continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of SN-38, SN-38G and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 were determined by a modified high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median, maximum and minimum values of plasma SN-38G/SN-38 ratios were 4.25, 7.09 and 1.03, respectively, indicating that UGT activities are variable among patients with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> UGT1A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma SN-38G/SN-38 ratios decreased with an increase in the trial numbers of chemotherapy (r=0.741, p=0.000669), suggesting that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 treatment suppresses UGT activity, and the low plasma SN-38G/SN-38 ratios resulted in the induction of greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in this analysis, 2 clearly separated regression lines were observed between plasma SN-38G/SN-38 ratios and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, UGT activity involved in SN-38 metabolism is variable among patients with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> UGT1A1 gene, and each <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 treatment suppresses UGT activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-point determination of the plasma SN-38G/SN-38 ratio may provide indications for the prediction of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and adjustment of the optimal dose, although further studies are required </plain></SENT>
