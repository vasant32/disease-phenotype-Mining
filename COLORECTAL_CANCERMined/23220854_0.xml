<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But until now, although above studies suggested that EGFR and Her2 may serve as effective biomarkers for targeted therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, the information on these biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is still limited in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) on the lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (LNM) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), develop LNM-associated biomarkers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Differences in EGFR and Her2 expression between primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with LNM (LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and without LNM (non-LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were assessed in a total of 126 Chinese colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> samples using quantitative real-time PCR analysis and western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confirmation assay with immunohistochemistry (IHC) study was applied in the same samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship to clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of candidate biomarkers was also examined in the same samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EGFR and Her2 were significantly upregulated in LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to non-LNM <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were confirmed in the immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of EGFR and Her2 were significantly associated with LNM (P &lt; 0.001), advanced TNM stage (P &lt; 0.001), increased 5-year recurrence rate (P &lt; 0.001) and decreased 5-year overall survival rate (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that EGFR and Her2 expression were useful independent prognostic factor for recurrence and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EGFR and Her2 might serve as a potential biomarker for LNM and a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of EGFR or Her2 is a potential predict factor to the poor outcome in clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
