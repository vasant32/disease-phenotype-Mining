<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with a total of 31 lesions were included in the comparison of TCEUS vs. MRI and nine patients with a total of 19 lesions were included in the comparison of ICEUS vs. MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI examinations were performed before TCEUS and ICEUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis was performed lesion by lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and accuracy were calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On comparing TCEUS with MRI, sensitivity differed significantly, with values of 87% and 100%, respectively (p value &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison of ICEUS with MRI, however, showed no significant difference in sensitivity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> or accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transabdominal and intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound have no added value in the preoperative evaluation of patients with CRLM undergoing extensive gadobenate dimeglumine liver MRI </plain></SENT>
