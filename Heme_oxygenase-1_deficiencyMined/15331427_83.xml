<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the specific role of HO-1 in modulating the immune response, we examined the differences in immune phenotype between HO-1 knockout (HO-1(-/-)) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (HO-1(+/+)) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous findings, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were observed in HO-1(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lymph nodes of HO-1-deficient mice demonstrated a relative paucity of CD3- and B220-positive cells, but no such abnormalities were observed in the thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of isolated splenocytes demonstrated no differences in the proportions of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes or monocytes/macrophages between the HO-1(-/-) and HO-1(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher baseline serum IgM levels were observed in HO-1(-/-) versus HO-1(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> or anti-CD3/anti-CD28, HO-1(-/-) splenocytes secreted disproportionately higher levels of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines as compared to those from HO-1(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate significant differences in the immune phenotype between the HO-1(-/-) and the HO-1(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absence of HO-1 correlates with a Th1-weighted shift in cytokine responses suggesting a general pro-inflammatory tendency associated with HO-1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
