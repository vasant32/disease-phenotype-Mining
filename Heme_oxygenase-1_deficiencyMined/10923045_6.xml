<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a family affected by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) deficiency [Yachie et al., 1999] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband was a compound heterozygote for a complete loss of exon 2 (the maternal allele) and a two-nucleotide deletion within exon 3 (the paternal allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe a large genomic deletion (1730 bp) including entire exon 2 in this family as a specific mechanism generating exon-2 absence observed in the HO-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the deletion junction demonstrated fusion of a 5' portion of Alu-Sx element with a 3' portion of Alu-Sq element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The junction contained sequences with high homology to the recombinogenic Alu "core" sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These structural features of the HO-1 gene suggest homologous recombination associated with Alu element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study presents the initial characterization of the HO-1 gene defect causing a human case of HO-1 deficiency and provides the molecular basis for understanding this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
