<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In preliminary studies, we observed that the absence of HO-1 in aortic allograft recipients resulted in 100% mortality within 4 days due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, recipients normally expressing HO-1 showed 100% graft patency and survival for more than 56 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abdominal aortic transplants were performed using Balb/cJ mice as donors and either HO-1(+/+) or HO-1(-/-) (C57BL/6xFVB) mice as recipients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of recipients with CORM-2, a CO-releasing molecule (10 mg/kg of body weight intravenously), 1 hour prior and 1, 3, and 6 days after transplantation, significantly improved survival (62% at &gt;56 days, P &lt; 0.001) compared with HO-1(-/-) recipients treated with inactive CORM-2 (median survival 1 day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological analyses revealed that CO treatment markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0009549'>reduced platelet aggregation</z:mp> within the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adoptive transfer of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> platelets to HO-1(-/-) recipients also conferred protection and increased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic transplants from either HO-1(-/-) or HO-1(+/+) C57BL/6 donors into HO-1(+/+) (Balb/cJ) mice did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, surviving more than 56 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate an important role for systemic HO-1/CO for protection against vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in murine aortic allotransplantation </plain></SENT>
