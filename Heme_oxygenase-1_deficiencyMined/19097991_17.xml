<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, circulating levels of HMGB1 are increased, but in a delayed fashion compared with early <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To counteract the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> of endotoxemia, a secondary anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> ensues in an attempt to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One such cytoprotective gene that is induced during endotoxemia is <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HO-1, and its products of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> metabolism, possess anti-inflammatory and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties to counter the damaging effects of endotoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we wanted to determine whether tissue and circulating levels of HMGB1 are increased further in the absence of HO-1 during endotoxemia, and whether this increase may contribute to the pathobiology of endotoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001861'>Lung inflammation</z:mp>, HMGB1 protein levels, and expression of HMGB1 in inflammatory cells were increased in HO-1(-/-) mice compared with HO-1+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the administration of LPS, tissue levels of HMGB1 were not increased further in HO-1(-/-) mice; however, circulating levels of HMGB1 were higher when compared with HO-1+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HO-1(-/-) mice treated with a <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi>-releasing molecule or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> showed a reduction in plasma HMGB1, which was associated with a marked improvement in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HO-1(-/-) mice given HMGB1-neutralizing antibody showed improvement in survival compared with control antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that exaggerated circulating levels of HMGB1 contribute to endotoxin-induced mortality in the absence of HO-1 </plain></SENT>
