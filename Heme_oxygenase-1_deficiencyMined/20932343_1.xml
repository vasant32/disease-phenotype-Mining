<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HO-1 isoform is both inducible and cyto-protective during <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and lung injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about its precise role and function in lung development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that HO-1 is required for mouse postnatal lung alveolar development and that vascular expression of HO-1 is essential and protective during postnatal alveolar development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neonatal lung development in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and HO-1 mutant mice was evaluated by histological and molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these newborn mice were treated with postnatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (Dex) till postnatal 14 days, and evaluated for lung development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> littermates, HO-1 mutant mice exhibited disrupted lung alveolar structure including simplification, disorganization and reduced secondary crest formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These defects in alveolar development were more pronounced when these mice were challenged with Dex treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of both vascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial markers were also further decreased in HO-1 mutants after Dex treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These experiments demonstrate that HO-1 is required in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lung development and that HO-1 disruption and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> exposure are additive in the disruption of postnatal lung growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We speculate that HO-1 is involved in postnatal lung development through modulation of pulmonary vascular development </plain></SENT>
