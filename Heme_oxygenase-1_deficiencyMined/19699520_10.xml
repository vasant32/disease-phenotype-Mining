<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficiencies in HO-1, the inducible isoform, have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy disorders</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo>, and pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify if a deficiency in HO-1 affects placental development using a mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When HO-1 heterozygote (Het, HO-1(+/-)) mice were cross-bred, an extremely low birth rate in homozygote (Mut, HO-1(-/-)) offspring (2.4%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001935'>small litter sizes</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Placentas and fetuses from Het cross-breedings were relatively smaller and weighed less than those from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) cross-breedings at E12.5 and E15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Het placentas had significantly less HO-1 mRNA and protein levels than WT placentas, but no significant differences in placental HO activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, HO-2, the constituitive HO isoform, as well as iNOS and eNOS expression were significantly upregulated in Het placentas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed that the junctional zone (JZ) of Het placentas were markedly thinner than those of WT placentas and appeared to be due to an increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that HO-1-expressing cells were located primarily in the JZ of Het placentas, specifically in the spongiotrophoblast layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, diastolic blood pressures and plasma soluble VEGFR-1 (sFlt-1) levels were significantly elevated in pregnant Het mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a partial deficiency in HO-1 is associated with morphological changes in the placenta and elevations in maternal diastolic blood pressure and plasma sFlt-1 levels, despite a compensatory increase in HO-2 expression </plain></SENT>
