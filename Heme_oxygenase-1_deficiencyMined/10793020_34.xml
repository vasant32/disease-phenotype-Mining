<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It consists of three isoforms: an inducible form (HO-1), a constitutive form (HO-2), and the third isoform (HO-3), with properties similar to HO-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is limited evidence to suggest that the induction of HO-1 may have anti-inflammatory effects in an in vivo model of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-mediated renal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We experienced the first human case of HO-1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo>, with biochemical evidence of renal tubular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We obtained three consecutive renal specimens: two from renal biopsies at 2 and 5 years of age and the third from autopsy at 6 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had systemic vascular endothelial-cell injury with massive intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serum was loaded with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> and a large amount of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-conjugated haptoglobin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high concentration of haptoglobin was also detectable in urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mesangial proliferation or change in glomerular capillary-wall thickness was relatively mild to moderate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination showed widespread endothelial detachment and subendothelial deposits of an unidentifiable material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was striking that tubulointerstitial injury, with tubular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and inflammatory cell infiltration, advanced progressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tubular epithelial cells were injured, and massive deposition of iron and haptoglobin was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bowman's capsules were dilated significantly, probably secondary to the collapse of atrophic tubuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to show that HO-1 has critical roles in vivo in protecting renal tubuli, in addition to vascular endothelium, from oxidative injury </plain></SENT>
