<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enzyme <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1), through its known anti-inflammatory activity, is a candidate for a functional role in Treg activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1-deficient (hmox-1(-/-)) mice in order to assess the role of HO-1 in mouse Treg development and function under physiologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of CD25+ and Foxp3+ Treg was similar in hmox-1(-/-) and hmox-1(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More importantly, CD4+ CD25+ Treg purified from either hmox-1(-/-) or hmox-1(+/+) mice were equally efficient in controlling the proliferation in vitro and the expansion in vivo of CD4+ CD25- T cells, whether or not these responder cells expressed HO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, induction of expression of HO-1 in vivo did not affect Treg suppressor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As shown before, expression of HO-1 was higher in Treg than in naive T cells; however, naturally activated Foxp3- T cells displayed equal amount of HO-1 mRNA as Treg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we conclude that under physiological conditions in mice, Treg development, maintenance and function are independent of HO-1 activity </plain></SENT>
