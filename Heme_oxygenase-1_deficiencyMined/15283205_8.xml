<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene targeted mutant, knockout. or transgenic mice are widely used in the laboratory investigation of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a simple and reproducible "lumen digestion" technique to isolate aortic endothelial cells from mice that would be useful for researchers in endothelial cell biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, homozygote, or heterozygote <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 null mice from which the aorta is isolated and removed under anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After cauterizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the branches, both ends of the aorta are cannulated using an Intramedic PE-20 tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After flushing the aorta with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the lumen is repeatedly instilled (five times) with 50 microL 0.25% trypsin in PBS, incubated for 2 min, and flushed with PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outflow is collected in endothelial cell media with 20% fetal bovine serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After centrifugation, the endothelial cells in the pellet are resuspended in media and plated in a 24-well tissue culture dish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following culture for 2 to 3 weeks, the cells demonstrate typical cobblestone appearance, stain positive for the endothelial marker CD31, and are capable of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following challenge with oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 deficient endothelial cells demonstrate increased susceptibility to cell injury </plain></SENT>
