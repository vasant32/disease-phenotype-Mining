<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient is a six-year-old boy with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He has been suffering from persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> characterized by marked erythrocyte fragmentation and intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, with paradoxical increase of serum haptoglobin and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal coagulation</z:e>/fibrinolysis system, associated with elevated thrombomodulin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, indicated the presence of severe, persistent endothelial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of renal glomeruli revealed detachment of endothelium, with subendothelial deposition of an unidentified material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>Iron deposition</z:mpath> was noted in renal and hepatic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of hepatic tissue and immunoblotting of a <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi>-stimulated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) revealed complete absence of HO-1 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An LCL derived from the patient was extremely sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50385">hemin</z:chebi>-induced cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the patient's HO-1 gene revealed complete loss of exon-2 of the maternal allele and a two-nucleotide deletion within exon3 of the paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>Growth retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath>, and vulnerability to stressful injury are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> characteristics observed in recently described HO-1 targeted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study presents not only the first human case of HO-1 deficiency but may also provide clues to the key roles played by this important enzyme in vivo </plain></SENT>
