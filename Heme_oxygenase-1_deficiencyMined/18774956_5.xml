<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This enzyme also appears to be responsible for the resolution of inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a patient with HO-1 deficiency, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and dysregulation of body iron homeostasis, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and liver and kidney <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp>, are evidenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we postulated that HO-1 is critical in the regulation of ferroportin, the major cellular iron exporter, and hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis central in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our current experiments in human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 monocytic cells indicate a HO-1-induced iron-mediated surface-ferroportin expression, consistent with the role of HO-1 in iron recycling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we observed low hepcidin levels in the HO-1-deficient patient, despite the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp>, both inducers of hepcidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, we observed highly increased soluble transferrin receptor levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the decreased hepcidin levels in HO-1 deficiency reflect the increased need for iron in the bone marrow due to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells, we demonstrate that HO-activity did not have a direct modulating effect on expression of HAMP, the gene that encodes for hepcidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we argue that the decreased iron recycling may, in part, have contributed to the low hepcidin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that dysregulation of iron homeostasis in HO-1 deficiency is the result of both defective iron recycling and erythroid activity-associated inhibition of hepcidin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study therefore shows a crucial role for HO-1 in maintaining body iron balance </plain></SENT>
