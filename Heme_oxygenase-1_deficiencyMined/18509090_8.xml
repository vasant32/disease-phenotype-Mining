<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These diametrically opposed processes are likely to be regulated by genes that mediate cellular adaptation to physiologic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we show that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the inducible isozyme of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> degradation, is a key regulator of these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking one allele of HO-1 (HO-1(+/-)) showed accelerated hematopoietic recovery from myelotoxic injury, and HO-1(+/-) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> repopulated lethally irradiated recipients with more rapid kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, HO-1(+/-) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> were ineffective in radioprotection and serial repopulation of myeloablated recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perturbations in key stem cell regulators were observed in HO-1(+/-) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> and hematopoietic progenitors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e>), which may explain the disrupted response of HO-1(+/-) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control of stem cell stress response by HO-1 presents opportunities for metabolic manipulation of stem cell-based therapies </plain></SENT>
