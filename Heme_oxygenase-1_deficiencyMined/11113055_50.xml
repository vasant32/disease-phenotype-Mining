<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A disease process characterized by decreases in vascular tone and increases in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036981" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endotoxic shock</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HO-1 is markedly induced in multiple organs after the administration of endotoxin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> [LPS]) to mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the role of HO-1 in endotoxemia, we administered LPS to mice that were <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), or homozygous null (-/-) for targeted disruption of HO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LPS produced a similar induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein in HO-1(+/+) and HO-1(+/-) mice, whereas HO-1(-/-) mice showed no HO-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four hours after LPS, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, SBP was significantly higher in HO-1(-/-) mice (121+/-5 mm Hg) after 24 hours, compared with HO-1(+/+) (96+/-7 mm Hg) and HO-1(+/-) (89+/-13 mm Hg) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A sustained increase in endothelin-1 contributed to this SBP response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even though SBP was higher, mortality was increased in HO-1(-/-) mice, and they exhibited hepatic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> that was not present in HO-1(+/+) and HO-1(+/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The end-organ damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in HO-1(-/-) mice was related to increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the increased mortality during endotoxemia in HO-1(-/-) mice is related to increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and end-organ (renal and hepatic) damage, not to refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
