A total of 51 patients with the subclavian steal-syndrome (SSS) were examined for the clinical picture comparatively to the angiography and ultrasound dopplerography (USDG) data. The clinical manifestations of cerebral circulatory disorders were studied not only in the isolated SSS but also in its different variants realized in association with concomitant lesions of the other branches of the aortic arch. Rarely occurring variants of the SSS were revealed; some of them were discovered for the first time. The types of collateral circulation to compensate for arm blood supply in the SSS were specified using the authors' material. The studies have confirmed that USDG is a fairly informative method of diagnosing the SSS.
