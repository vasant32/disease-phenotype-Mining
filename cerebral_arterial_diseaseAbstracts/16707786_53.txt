Systemic administration of anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) antibodies results in reduced parenchymal amyloid but increased vascular amyloid and microhemorrhage in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. Here, we evaluate the effects of reducing effector interactions of the antibody via deglycosylation. Mice aged 20 months were treated weekly for 4 months and tested behaviorally before they were killed. APP transgenic mice receiving either anti-Abeta (2H6) or deglycosylated anti-Abeta (de-2H6) showed significant improvement in radial arm water maze performance compared with mice receiving a control antibody. Both groups receiving anti-Abeta antibodies showed significant reductions in total Abeta immunochemistry and Congo red. Significantly fewer vascular amyloid deposits and microhemorrhages were observed in mice administered the de-2H6 antibody compared with those receiving unmodified 2H6 antibody. Deglycosylated anti-Abeta antibodies may be preferable to unmodified IgG because they retain the cognition-enhancing and amyloid-reducing properties of anti-Abeta immunotherapy, while greatly attenuating the increased vascular amyloid deposition and microhemorrhage observed with unmodified IgG.
