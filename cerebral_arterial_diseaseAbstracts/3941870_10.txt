The radiologic findings in three cases of meningovascular syphilis are presented. Angiography demonstrated varying degrees of narrowing and ectasia of the supraclinoid carotid, basilar, and proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries, as well as distal branches. Computed tomography (CT) showed multifocal infarction with variable enhancement. Similarly, in the one case studied with magnetic resonance (MR), several regions of high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences were found, which were compatible with foci of ischemia. Although the radiologic findings are nonspecific, the diagnosis of meningovascular syphilis should be considered in patients with vasculitis of uncertain etiology.
