A case of coccidioidal meningitis with cerebral arteritis in a nonendemic area is reported. Interesting clinical features were the difficulties in clinical diagnosis, hydrocephalus, and neurological deficits. An autopsy revealed chronic basal meningitis, cerebral arteritis, cerebral infarcts, hydrocephalus, and an old solitary pulmonary granuloma all due to Coccidioides immitis. The rare occurrence of cerebral arteritis due to C. immitis and clinicopathological correlations are discussed.
