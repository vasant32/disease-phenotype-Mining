Bilateral paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic infarcts are infrequently reported in adults, and to our knowledge, has never been reported in a child. The presumed etiology is an occlusion of the artery of Percheron, an uncommon vascular variation, in which a single common trunk from one of the P1 segments of the posterior cerebral artery provides bilateral irrigation to the paramedian thalami and midbrain. Bilateral paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic infarcts in adults are associated with symptoms of decreased arousal, vertical gaze paresis, mood changes, and memory difficulties. Although some improvement of these symptoms does occur, complete recovery is rare. We present here a full-term male neonate, whose right-hand sided clonic seizures on day-of-life 2 prompted neuroimaging, which revealed bilateral paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic infarcts, suggestive of an occlusion of the artery of Percheron.
