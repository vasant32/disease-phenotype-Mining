Using the 2000 National Inpatient Sample, this study examined the patterns of disparities regarding acute care outcomes of ischemic stroke among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific-Islander patients. The data from 13,316 patients with carotid artery-related stroke and 33,149 patients with cerebral artery occlusion were examined. Although racial disparities associated with carotid artery occlusion and cerebral artery occlusion varied, overall, as compared with Caucasians, minorities suffered greater neurologic impairment and had poorer outcomes. For example, among patients with carotid artery occlusion, 62.5% of Caucasian patients had paralysis, compared with 71.2% of African Americans, 69.1% of Hispanics, and 74.0% of Asian patients. Poorer outcomes among African Americans and Hispanics coexisted with higher frequencies of cerebral artery disease in these populations, suggesting possible etiologic factors related to diabetes and high cholesterol levels. Etiologic factors contributing to disparities in the Asian population remain to be determined.
