In the investigation of atherosclerosis, cholesterol and its fractions, triglycerides and glucose are more tested than phospholipids. We were interested by this category of lipids in Senegalese suffering from cerebrovascular disease. We did not find differences between healthy and non healthy subjects for the total phospholipids; but the high density lipoprotein phospholipids were significantly lowered in non healthy subjects. This decrease might explain in part, the atherosclerosis strike. Practicians should pay more attention in this lipidic parameter, using the reference values established in Senegalese.
