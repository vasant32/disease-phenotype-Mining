Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy has recently been shown to be caused by a point mutation in the cystatin C gene. To determine the chromosomal localization of the gene, 20 human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and a full-length cystatin C cDNA probe were used. Southern blot analysis of BamHI digested cell hybrid DNA revealed that the probe recognizes a 10.6 kb human specific fragment and that this fragment cosegregates with human chromosome 20. Therefore, the human cystatin C gene (CST3) was assigned to chromosome 20.
