Varicella-zoster virus infection has been implicated in a broad range of neurologic complications. In Hispanic immigrants, primary varicella often appears in adolescents and young adults.

An association between varicella infection and vasculitis is increasingly being described and should be considered in the evaluation of stroke in young adults.
