We report our experience with intraoperative digital subtraction neuroangiography to demonstrate its application as a diagnostic and therapeutic technique. Intraoperative neuroangiography was performed on 53 occasions in 43 patients using a portable imaging system. Thirty-two procedures were performed for diagnostic purposes after resection of arteriovenous malformations, clipping of aneurysms, or carotid endarterectomy. Unexpected problems were disclosed in seven cases and were surgically remedied immediately in four. In addition, angiography was used as a therapeutic tool in 21 cases to facilitate intraoperative embolization of a vascular lesion or to enable the angioplasty of a vessel inaccessible without direct surgical exposure. We found that by allowing a combined interventional neuroangiographic and neurosurgical approach, intraoperative angiography opened new avenues for treatment of intracranial vascular abnormalities.
