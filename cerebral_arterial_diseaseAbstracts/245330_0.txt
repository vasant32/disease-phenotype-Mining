A patient with the volitional type of facial palsy showed in the arteriography an obstruction of the middle cerebral artery without affecting the thalamostriatal arteries. As laughing and weeping are motivated in the cerebral trunc they must have been projected through the mesopallium (which includes the thalamus) to the facial nuclei. These two behaviour elements did not show any modification on the paretic side, indicating so, that they are phylogenetic old elements, normally modified by the volitional influence. The original weeping expresses an appeal to the companion, the original laughing the readiness of affilation.
