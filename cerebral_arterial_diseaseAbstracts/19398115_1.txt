BACKGROUND: Homocysteine (Hcy) has been recognized as a risk factor for atherosclerosis. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) on MRI has been regarded as a hallmark for cerebral small vascular disease. The study is to investigate the relationship between plasma Hcy level and WMH on a hospital-based cohort of Taiwanese stroke patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 352 consecutive stroke patients (64.7+/-11.2 years) were included. Severity of WMH was semi-quantitatively evaluated with a scoring system. The top WMH score tertile was defined as severe white matter change (sv-WMH). Associations between Hcy tertile levels and sv-WMH were examined, adjusting for demographics and atherosclerosis risk factors. Subjects in the top Hcy tertile (>10.25 micromol/L) had higher WMH scores and prevalence of sv-WMH than those in the middle and in the bottom tertile. The adjusted odds ratio of having sv-WMH was 2.04 (95% confidence interval 1.20-3.47, p=0.008) for the top Hcy level tertile than for the lower two tertiles combined. CONCLUSION: Hcy is a risk factor for cerebral white matter lesion in stroke patients. Even mild hyperhomocysteinemia can significantly increase severity of cerebral microangiopathy.
