A 54-year-old female presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a small middle cerebral artery aneurysm, found to be thrombosed at surgery and not visualized on the preoperative angiograms. One major branch of the middle cerebral artery was found to be occluded near the trifurcation. The lumen of the branch proximal to the occlusion had appeared as the aneurysmal opacification on the preoperative angiograms.
