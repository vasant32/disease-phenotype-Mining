On the basis of examining 72 patients 14 of whom later died it has been concluded that the most substantial differences of large and giant aneurysms of cerebral arteries from small ones consist in development of focal neurological symptoms and intracranial hypertension: this is due to both compression of the brain structures and disturbance of the cerebral circulation caused by aneurysms more than 2 cm long. The intracranial hypertension is the most frequent in aneurysms over 3 cm long, especially, if those aneurysms are localized in the vicinity of cerebral liquor ducts. Patients with arterial aneurysms exceeding 2 cm develop hemorrhagic complications in 2/3 of the cases. While using modern treatment methods (stereotaxic and intravascular) one should take into account the peculiarities of the structure of large and giant aneurysms in the brain.
