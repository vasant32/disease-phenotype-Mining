The histopathology of Sneddon's syndrome (livedo racemosa generalisata and cerebrovascular defects) is characterized by a thickened intima with subsequent narrowing of the lumen of ascending arterioles in the upper subcutaneous tissue and deep dermis. Ultrastructurally, migrating medial smooth muscle cells with plenty of intermediate filaments colonize the subendothelial intimal space ("intima proliferation").
