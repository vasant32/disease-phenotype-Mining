Major pitfalls in Doppler investigations are presented based on 340 evaluated cerebral Doppler examinations in infants. Substantial pitfalls may result from: A. Physics of sound waves and Doppler instruments (errors due to high pass filter cut off, aliasing, rapid image update). B. Quality and adjustment of the Doppler instrument (errors due to low sensitivity, inappropriate adjustment of Doppler controls, inadequate wall filter). C. Examination technique (errors due to an unfavourable angle of incidence or due to transducer-induced pressure: decrease predominantly in diastolic flow velocity-increase in maximum flow velocity in the straight sinus). D. Hemodynamics (errors due to spatial or temporal variations of the flow profile, pulsatility, non-uniform distribution of cerebral blood flow/CBF). E. Cerebral vascular anatomy (errors due to an unfavourable probe position as related to the three-dimensional arrangement of vessels, inadequate separation of closely adjacent vessels). F. Interpretation (flow velocity or Resistance Index/RI is taken to equal CBF, RI is taken to equal peripheral vascular resistance, one artery is taken to represent the cerebral circulation). Pitfalls may be avoided by using adequate means (low wall filter adjustment, high Doppler frequency, critical assessment of velocity spectra) to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring.
