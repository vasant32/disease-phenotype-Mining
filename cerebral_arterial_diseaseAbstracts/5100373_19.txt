Phenoxybenzamine was injected into the carotid artery of 23 patients after operations on their cerebral arterial aneurysms. Rapid improvement was seen in three cases with pronounced neurological disability. The other 20 were treated prophylactically in an attempt to prevent the onset of spasm. These results would appear to indicate that intracarotid phenoxybenzamine may be of value in the treatment of cerebral arterial spasm, provided that it is given before irreversible infarction of the brain has occurred. Until more is known about its action it would be best to give the drug only after operation.
