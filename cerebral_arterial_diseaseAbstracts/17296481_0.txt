Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) involve the sudden and brief loss of cerebral or ocular function, due to ischemic causes, with complete recovery at the moment of examination. TIAs, too often trivialized, require specialized emergency management. The risk of cerebral infarction within 7 days after TIA can reach 35%. All transient neurological signs are not TIAs. The principal causes of TIAs are atherosclerosis, cerebral arteriolopathy, and emboligenic heart disease. Treatment by platelet aggregation inhibitors (aspirin 160-300 mg) should begin immediately and be adjusted according to test results.
