BVR was 77 years old when he sustained a large posterior cerebral artery territory infarct. Medical, cognitive and functional data collected on four occasions over 10 years initially revealed circumscribed neurological signs, no functional or cognitive deficits. BVR became significantly impaired only after two other strokes, 3 years before death. On brain MRI, the lesions involved large portions of the right occipital and temporal cortices, the right thalamus, and the left cerebellum, as well as thinning of the corpus callosum. Postmortem investigations revealed additional recent vascular lesions in the occipital region. This case study underscores the importance of comprehensive assessment methods combining neurological, neuroimaging and cognitive tools.
