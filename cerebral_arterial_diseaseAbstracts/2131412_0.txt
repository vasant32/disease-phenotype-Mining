On the basis of neurological, psychological and computed tomographic examinations of the head late consequences are presented of classical exclusion of middle cerebral artery aneurysm. It was demonstrated that compression of the brain with a spatula and the extent of shifting apart of the walls of the lateral fissure of the brain during the operation may lead to ischaemic changes in the temporal lobe near the lateral fissure. These changes may cause impairment of mental efficiency late after the operation. It was shown also that during the operations for aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery at the site of its division the approach by forcing apart the fissure over the site of division would be less damaging than the approach along the trunk of the artery.
