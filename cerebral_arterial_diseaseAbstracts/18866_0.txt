The content of the lactic acid (LA) and pyruvic acid (PA) was determined pre- and postoperatively in the arterial blood and CSF of 31 patients with intracranial aneurysms. A considerable elevation of the concentration of LA and PA was noted along with an increasing LA/PA in the CSF of patients with symptoms of ischaemic damage of the brain. During surgery under fluothane narcosis these patients also demonstrated a distinct elevation of the LA level along with an increasing LA/PA ratio. In the CSF the growing content of glycolysis metabolites was not accompanied by LA/PA changes. The employment of artificial hypotension had no important effect upon the changes of these parameters in the CSF.
