Inclined lateral projections prove useful in defining aneurysms situated about the circle of Willis. For these projections, the x-ray tube and film changer are positioned as for a true lateral projection. The MCA lateral projection (patient's head inclined away from the side of injection) is valuable in investigating aneurysms of the internal carotid artery, posterior communicating artery and middle cerebral artery trifurcation. The ACA lateral projection (head inclined toward the side of injection) may be used to define aneurysms in the region of the anterior communicating artery.
