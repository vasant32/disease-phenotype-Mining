Intracranial vertebral endarterectomy was performed on six patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency in whom medical therapy failed. The patients underwent operations for stenotic plaque in the intracranial vertebral artery with the opposite vertebral artery being occluded, hypoplastic, or severely stenosed. In four of the patients, the stenosis was mainly proximal to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). In this group, after endarterectomy, the vertebral artery was patent in two patients, and their symptoms resolved; in one patient the endarterectomy occluded, but the patient's symptoms improved; and in one patient the endarterectomy was unsuccessful, and he continued to have symptoms. In one patient, the plaque was at the origin of the PICA. The operation appeared technically to be successful, but the patient developed a cerebellar infarction and died. In one patient the stenosis was distal to the PICA. During endarterectomy, the plaque was found to invade the posterior wall of the vertebral artery. The vertebral artery was ligated, and the patient developed a Wallenburg syndrome. The results of superficial temporal artery to superior cerebellar artery anastomosis are better than those for intracranial vertebral endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic intracranial vertebral artery stenosis. The use of intracranial vertebral endarterectomy should be limited to patients who have disabling symptoms despite medical therapy, a focal lesion proximal to the PICA, and a patent posterior circulation collateral or bypass.
