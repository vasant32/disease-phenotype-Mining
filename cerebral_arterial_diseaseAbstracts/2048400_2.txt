Outcome was studied prospectively in 28 consecutive patients with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). They comprise a subgroup of 101 consecutive patients with TIA or stroke less than or equal to 75 years of age, admitted within 72 h after the stroke. Cerebral angiography and CT-scan were performed within 1-2 days of admission. CT-scan was repeated 6 months later. Functional status on admission, 3 and 6 months after the stroke was evaluated using the Rankin disability scale (score 1-2: independent of others care, score 3-5: dependent on others care). The degree of hemiparesis was measured using the Medical Research Council's score. Thirteen had infarcts with a diameter less than or equal to 3 cm (mean 2.5 +/- 0.9 cm); 15 had infarcts greater than 3 cm (mean 6.3 +/- 1.4 cm); 10 had trunk occlusions; 18 had branch occlusions. MCA occlusions with large infarcts and severe hemiparesis on admission carried a poor outcome. Eleven (85%) of 13 patients with the case in only 1 (7%) of the 15 with infarcts greater than 3 cm, the remaining 14 (93%) had either died (40%) or were dependent (53%) (p less than 0.00005). Eleven (85%) of 13 patients with mild hemiparesis on admission were independent, while 13 (87%) of 15 with moderate or severe hemiparesis on admission had either died (40%) or were dependent on others' care (47%) 6 months after the stroke (p less than 0.0004). Type of occlusion (branch trunk) was a poor predictor of outcome.
