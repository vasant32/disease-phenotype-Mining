The best surgical approach for the treatment of patients with severe cerebral artery disease and simultaneous serious coronary artery disease remains controversial. In this report, we present a case of a 65-year-old man admitted to the hospital with unstable angina. Triple coronary artery obstructive disease and severe right internal carotid artery stenosis in the retroparotid region were diagnosed. A combined, simultaneous surgical procedure was performed. A lesion located in the retroparotid space required an approach by a presternocleidomastoid cervicotomy extended distally. Venous grafting of the internal carotid artery was performed. After carotid reconstruction, the three coronary arteries were revascularized without extracorporeal circulation. The patient showed a satisfactory postoperative outcome.
