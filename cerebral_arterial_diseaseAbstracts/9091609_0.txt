We report a case of agenesis of the internal carotid artery which was revealed by a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography showed a ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery and unilateral absence of the left internal carotid artery. Both the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries were perfused from the right carotid artery via the anterior communicating artery. Absence of the left carotid canal was proved on bone CT. Such an association is discussed. An hemodynamic stress on a congenital defect of the cerebral arterial wall could be the origin of the aneurysm development.
