The authors present a patient with striking angiographic findings of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cerebral vasculitis. Although lupus is often cited as part of the differential diagnosis for angiographically apparent cerebral vasculitis, true SLE cerebral vasculitis is rare in pathological and radiological series. The clinical spectrum and pathological findings of CNS lupus with particular attention to cerebral vasculitis are briefly discussed.
