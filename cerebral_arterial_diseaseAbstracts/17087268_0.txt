We report 2 cases of multiple aneurysms (AN) associated with main trunk artery occlusion. CASE 1: A 52-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with dysarthria and weakness of the right side of the body. Computed tomography (CT) showed cerebral infarction in the left corona radiata. MR angiography and conventional angiography showed occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and saccular aneurysms (ANs) at the origin of the anterior communicating artery (A-com) and bifurcation of the right MCA. Subsequent 123I-IMP-single photon emission tomography (SPECT) revealed marked reduction of cerebral blood flow and disturbed reactivity to acetazolamide in the left cerebral hemisphere. Superficial temporal artery (STA)-MCA anastomosis was performed to improve cerebral blood flow and reduce hemodynamic stress for AN of the A-com and right MCA. At 5 months after the first operation, neck clipping was performed successfully for the non-ruptured A-com AN and right MCA AN. CASE 2: A 65-year-old male was admitted to our hospital. CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 3D-computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and cerebral angiography showed basilar top AN, A-com AN and right MCA AN associated with right internal carotid artery occlusion. Right ACA and MCA territories were visualized from the A-com artery and posterior cerebral artery. STA-MCA anastomosis was performed to improve cerebral blood flow and reduce hemodynamic stress for ANs. In the same operation, successful neck clipping was performed for BA top AN and right MCA AN. In such cases as these, particularly in ischemic cases associated with main trunk artery occlusion, it was important to consider surgery for AN after STA-MCA anastomosis in anticipation of improved cerebral blood flow and reduce hemodynamic stress for AN.
