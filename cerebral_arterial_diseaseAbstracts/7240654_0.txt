99 non diabetic patients whose ocular examination showed characterized retinal arteriolosclerosis, with or without arterial hypertension, or macular alterations (senile degeneration, non aphakic retinal-vitreous interlayer syndrome, colloid degeneration) have been submitted to an cervico-encephalic vascular ultrasonographic Doppler examination. 25 to 56% revealed latent cerebral arteriopathy sometimes with arterial stenoses, peculiarly carotidal. Other 58, apparently healthy and likewise aged, tested in the same way, revealed only 12% notable arteriopathy.
