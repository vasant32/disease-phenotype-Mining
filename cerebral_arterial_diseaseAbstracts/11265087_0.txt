The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that severe multipedicular lesions involving supraaortic trunks cause compromised cerebral hemodynamics with nonhemispheric symptoms (NHS) that can be relieved by surgical treatment. A total of 11 patients were prospectively included in the study. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral blood flow reactivity (CBFR) were measured by acetazolamide single photon emission computed tomoscintigraphy scans (SPECT) before and after surgery. Seven patients presented with isolated NHS and four presented with NHS associated with hemispheric symptoms. Lesions consisted of either high-grade (>75%) bilateral carotid artery stenosis associated with vertebral or subclavian artery lesions or high-grade (>75%) bilateral vertebral or subclavian artery stenosis associated with medium-grade (>50%) carotid lesions. All patients presented with a functional circle of Willis with no significant intracranial arterial lesions and no corticosubcortical atrophy. A total of 15 procedures were performed for revascularization of 19 arteries. The cumulative morbidity/mortality rate was nil. All revascularizations were patent on postoperative controls. Results from this study show that multipedicular lesions lead to hemodynamic changes affecting hemispheric and vertebrobasilar territories. Surgical treatment can improve or normalize cerebral hemodynamic abnormalities and relieve NHS.
