A 20-year-old female experienced temporary unintentional mirror writing associated with low perfusion of the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries. When she was 17 years old, she had developed multiple idiopathic intracerebral hemorrhages and right hemiparesis. At the age of 20, she had a generalized convulsion for which she was transferred to our department. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance images of the brain were obtained, but no fresh abnormal lesion could be detected. The following day, after she had recovered from postictal symptoms, she wrote mirror image words, and her mirror writing then gradually improved within one week. Single photon emission CT showed low perfusion of both anterior cerebral arteries. We concluded that bilateral vascular insufficiency to the supplementary motor areas and corpus callosum caused mirror writing in this case.
