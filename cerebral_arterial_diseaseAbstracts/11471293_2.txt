PURPOSE: To evaluate TOF 3D magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial arteries in patients with vasculitis or vasculitis-like benign angiopathy of the central nervous system (CNS). METHOD: The results of MRA in 20 patients with clinically and radiographically proven vasculitis (17/20) or vasculitis-like benign angiopathy (3/20) of the CNS were retrospectively analysed. Patients with hyperintense lesions of more than 3 mm on T2-weighted MRI images were included in this trial. An inflammatory, embolic, neurodegenerative or metastatic origin of these lesions was excluded by extensive clinical studies. For the MR-examination a TOF 3D FISP sequence was used on a 1.5 T imager. RESULTS: MRA showed characteristic changes for vasculitis or angiopathy in 15 of 20 patients (75%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients suspected of having a vasculitis or vasculitis-like angiopathy, MRA is recommended as a non-invasive modality. If the results of MRI and extensive clinical studies are carefully correlated, MRA may substitute conventional angiography in cases with typical vascular changes.
