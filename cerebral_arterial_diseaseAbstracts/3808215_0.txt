Case 1. A seven-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital shortly after developing right hemiplegia and motor aphasia during rope-jumping play. Neither cervical trauma nor signs of cervical and pharyngeal inflammation were present. The physical examination was negative. The carotid angiogram on the day of admission gave poor visualization of the middle cerebral artery group, although the computerized tomographic finding was not remarkable. His neurological status gradually got better, while the routine laboratory studies gave only a slight increase of ESR (26 mm/hour) and positive CRP(I+). There were no particular findings of CSF from lumbar tap or of serological studies. The second computerized tomographic scan 42 hours after clinical onset showed a wide low dense area with obscure margin in the left parieto-temporal region, which was enhanced variously with intravenous contrast media. In about ten days his clinical state was remarkably improved. The second carotid angiogram one month after admission showed a poor filling of the middle cerebral artery territory and beaded appearance of the artery. The patient was discharged on the 46th day with a minimum right hemiparesis. Case 2. A ten-year-old boy was admitted with complaint of right hemiparesis and motor aphasia developing at night. The physical examination was negative. The laboratory studies were also negative. The computerized tomographic scan five days after onset showed a low dense area in size of 2 x 1.5 x 2 cm in the region of the left Nucleus lentiformis. No enhancement effect was seen. The left carotid angiogram on the same day revealed stenotic lesions at the M1 and the posterior temporal artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
