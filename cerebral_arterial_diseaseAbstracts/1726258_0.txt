A 53-year-old male complained of frequent left motor-sensory transient ischemic attack for 4 months. On admission, he demonstrated mild right hemiparesis, dysarthria, and right hemisensory disturbance of all modalities. Cerebral angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery just above the origin of the ophthalmic artery and a stenotic lesion at the horizontal segment of the right middle cerebral artery. Renal angiography showed severe stenosis of the right renal artery. Systolic blood pressure was over 200 mmHg and marked circadian variation of blood pressure was noted. Serum renin was 4.0 ng/ml/hr. Four months after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis, left carotid angiography showed good patency of the bypass and the ischemic symptoms completely disappeared. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed increased cerebral blood flow (CBF), especially in the left hemisphere after surgery. Six months after the bypass surgery, he complained of mild right hemiparesis again. Shortly after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for renal arterial stenosis, his hemiparesis was improved and the systolic blood pressure stabilized to 150-170 mmHg. SPECT showed the CBF had also recovered in both hemispheres. The improvement in ischemic symptoms and increased CBF after PTA were probably related to stabilization of the systemic blood pressure or inhibition of serum renin-angiotensin.
