The authors analyse the course of the immediate postoperative period in 27 patients with ruptured arterial aneurysms of the cerebral vessels. The dynamics of the local cerebral blood flow and electric resistance of the brain matter were examined for a comprehensive study of changes in cerebral circulation and metabolism. Intracranial pressure (ventricular and subdural) and mechanical resistance of the brain matter were measured with the M-34 mingograph. Such combination of the examination methods and the findings of neurological examination made it possible to study over time the pathological processes which are interconnected (circulation-metabolism-edema and swelling of the brain) and determine the course of the postoperative period. A dependence between the preoperative condition of patients and the course of the immediate postoperative period was revealed, adequate methods for correction of the pathological reactions are suggested, and the specific features of a complex clinico-physiological control in this category of patients and the informativeness of the different methods of examination are discussed.
