BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) MR imaging is a technique for depicting cerebral perfusion without contrast enhancement. Our purpose was to determine whether quantification at FAIR imaging can be used to assess regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a manner similar to [iodine 123]-iodoamphetamin ((123)I-IMP) single photon emission CT (SPECT). METHODS: Nine patients with internal carotid or major cerebral arterial stenosis underwent (123)I-IMP SPECT and FAIR imaging (single section, different TIs, 1.5 T) at rest and after acetazolamide (Diamox) stress. FAIR and (123)I-IMP rCBF values were compared and correlated. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to detect hypoperfused segments on FAIR images. RESULTS: rCBF values of normally perfused segments were 41.53 and 51.91 mL/100 g/min for pre- and post-acetazolamide (123)I-IMP studies, respectively. Corresponding values for pre- and post-acetazolamide FAIR images, respectively, were 46.64 and 59.60 mL/100 g/min with a TI of 1200 milliseconds and 53.23 and 68.17 mL/100 g/min with a TI of 1400 milliseconds. (123)I-IMP and FAIR results were significantly correlated, with both pre- and post-acetazolamide images. Sensitivity (86%) in detecting hypoperfused segments was significantly higher with post-acetazolamide images (TI, 1400 milliseconds), and specificity (82-85%) and accuracy (80-82%) were higher with all pre- and post-acetazolamide images (all TIs). CONCLUSIONS: The significant correlation, high specificity and accuracy in detecting hypoperfused segments, similar increases in flow on both post-acetazolamide images, and absence of the need for contrast enhancement suggest that FAIR imaging, like nuclear medicine study, is complementary to routine MR imaging in the assessment of cerebral perfusion.
