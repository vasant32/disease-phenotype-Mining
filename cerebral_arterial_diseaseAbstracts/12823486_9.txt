We studied the correlation between the potential causes of stroke (TOAST etiological groups) and the involvement of different vascular territories seen on computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with ischemic stroke. Information from consecutive patients with a first-ever stroke have been prospectively coded and entered into a computerized data bank (Perugia Stroke Registry). A population of 1,719 patients were evaluated: 1,284 patients (74.7%) had ischemic stroke. Large artery disease was the main cause of entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarcts (40.9%), superficial MCA territory infarcts (35.7%), and watershed infarcts (68.2%). The highest presence of emboligenic heart disease was found in the entire MCA territory infarcts (28.8%) or superficial (29.4%) supratentorial infarcts and in cerebellar infarcts (36.8%). Small artery disease was the most common presumed cause of deep MCA infarcts (75.0%) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarcts (52.1%). In conclusion: stroke location could depend on its etiology. Lacunar infarcts are the most prevalent (36.7%), being mostly localized in the deep MCA territory; large artery disease includes more than two-thirds of watershed infarcts; the most prevalent territories involved in cardioembolic stroke are the entire MCA and posterior fossa.
