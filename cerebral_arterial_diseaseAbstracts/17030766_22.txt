The WASID trial showed no advantage of warfarin over aspirin for preventing the primary endpoint of ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage, or vascular death. In analyses of selected subgroups, there was no definite benefit from warfarin. Warfarin reduced the risk of the primary endpoint among patients with basilar artery stenosis, but there was no reduction in stroke in the basilar artery territory or benefit for vertebral artery stenosis or posterior circulation disease in general.
