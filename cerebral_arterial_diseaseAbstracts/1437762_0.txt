Pathogenesis of vasospasms following subarachnoid haemorrhage and possible therapeutic efficacy of nimodipine (calcium channel blocking agent) are discussed. The authors present their own experience in the treatment of 209 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage with nimodipine. Collected clinical results suggest the necessity of the combined treatment of vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage with nimodipine, hypervolemia, and hypertensive agents.
