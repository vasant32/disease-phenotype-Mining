A 64-year-old male patient had two episodes of transient ischemic attack and a cerebral infarction. Cerebral angiography showed 50% stenosis at the junction of left internal carotid artery and 90% stenosis at left mid-cerebral artery (MCA). Coronary angiography showed two vessel disease with arteriosclerotic change and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. To prevent intraoperative cerebral infarction, we used brain protect solution just before starting ECC, set perfusion flow around 3 l/min/m2, monitored the flow of left MCA using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and the saturation of left internal jugular vein (SjO2) continuously. PaCO2 was controlled around 45 mmHg. TCD showed good pulsatile flow, and SjO2 was kept over 60%. The patient recovered consciousness 2 hours after operation in the intensive care unit without paresthesia. We thought the number of open-heart cases with cerebrovascular disease increased, and pulsatile low of ECC by intraaortic balloon pumping and the monitoring of SjO2 are useful for the cases.
