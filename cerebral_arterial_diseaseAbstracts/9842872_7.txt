BACKGROUND: Osteolipomas are distinguished from other intracranial lipomas by their arrangement of central adipose and peripheral osseous tissues and by characteristically arising in the suprasellar/interpeduncular region. METHODS: We report computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pathology findings from this 34-year-old man who underwent surgical removal of this benign lesion. RESULTS: This case displays the distinctive histopathology that has been reported in 13 of 31 (42%) lipomas in this region. In contrast, ossification of lipomas at other intracranial sites is relatively rare. CONCLUSIONS: Ossification should be expected in many suprasellar/interpeduncular lipomas, and osteolipoma should be included in the radiologic differential diagnosis of fat-intensity masses with calcification in this region.
