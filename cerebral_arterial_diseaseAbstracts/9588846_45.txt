Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) leads to brain cell death. However, quantitation of injured brain cells and inflammatory cells after MCAo has not been determined in the rat. Transient (2 h) MCAo was therefore induced in male Wistar rats by means of an intraluminal monofilament. Immunohistochemical and histochemical procedures performed at 46 h after MCAo were used to identify specific cellular populations in ischemic and control rats (n = 11). In the ischemic core of the lesion, approximately 24.7% of cells disappeared. Forty-four point eight percent of parenchymal cells consisted of intact (13.0%) or reversibly injured swollen (7.6%) and scalloped/shrunken dark (24.2%) cells. The percentage of irreversibly damaged cells was 55.2%, and included 49.9% necrotic cells (10.5% red and 39.4% ghost) and 5.4% apoptotic cells. In the inner boundary zone of the lesion, 15.9% of cells disappeared. Viable cells constituted 62.0% of all remaining cells. Neutrophils and macrophages were localized to this area. In the outer boundary zone of the lesion, 9.0% of cells disappeared. Viable cells constituted 91.6% of all remaining cells. The ratio of apoptotic to necrotic cells was 1:9, 1:6, 1:13 in the ischemic core, inner and outer boundary zones, respectively. Our data suggest the presence of three zones within the ischemic lesion: the core, and inner and outer boundaries. At 46 h after 2 h of MCAo the ischemic lesion is highly heterogeneous containing relatively large percentages of morphologically intact cells, suggesting the possibility of an extended window of therapeutic opportunity.
