125 patients with migraine were studied by determining the intracerebral blood flow by means of Doppler cranial neurosonography. The findings confirm the presence of certain nonsystematic vascular defects involved in the pathologic response of the synaptic factors of the cerebral blood flow, thus demonstrating the validity of the multiple pathologic arterial segments and the possibility of response to various therapies. The study classifies migraines based on Doppler cerebrovascular neurosonography.
