The morphological facts are represented, to see hearing alterations as a possible consequence of vertebro-basilar insufficiency. The conception: "vertebro-basilar insufficiency" is defined. Compared to vestibular disturbances cochlear disturbances in vertebro-basilar insufficiency are extremely rare. Always we find sensorineural hearing loss or complete unilateral deafness, most combined with tinnitus. All publications we got reported, only 4 from otologists. The conception "sudden deafness" is defined by differential diagnosis. The vertebro-basilar insufficiency, secured by arteriographical or neurological examinations, is not the same as a syndrome of cervical spine with effects to the vertebro-basilar artery system, except the pathogenesis of this syndrom is evident. But this evidence is not given till now.
