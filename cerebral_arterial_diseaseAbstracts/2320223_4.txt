The authors describe a rare case of multiple peripheral aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery found in association with a midline cerebellar arteriovenous malformation. Successful trapping of the aneurysms and excision of the arteriovenous malformation was accomplished with an excellent clinical result. The literature concerning aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, cerebellar arteriovenous malformations, and combined intracranial vascular abnormalities is discussed.
