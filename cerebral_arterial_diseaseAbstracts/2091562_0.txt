We report a case of acute confusional state (ACS) resulted from bilateral occlusion of anterior cerebral artery. This case is outstanding because development of ACS was caused by a focal lesion, without the presentation of focal neurologic signs. Then, cerebrovascular disease must be included in differential diagnosis of ACS, despite the lack of clinically detectable deficit.
