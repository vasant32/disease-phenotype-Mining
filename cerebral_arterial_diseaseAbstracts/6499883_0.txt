In this study 23 cases of immune vasculitis with predominance of neurological symptoms were analysed. Besides patient history and neurological examination, myelotomy is the most relevant means of diagnosis in immune vasculitis. For this reason myelotomy should be integrated in routine diagnostic methods if the diagnosis immune vasculitis is discussed. Other laboratory parameters have no great relevance in the diagnosis of immune vasculitis. A higher specificity of antibody tests, especially in the case of ANA, might be able to replace myelotomy in the diagnosis of immune vasculitis. The relevance of laboratory parameters in the diagnosis of immune vasculitis in neurological patients was examined.
