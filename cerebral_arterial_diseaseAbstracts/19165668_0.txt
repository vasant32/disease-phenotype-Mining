OBJECTIVE: To present an emerging clinical entity which may mimic another common entity. METHODS: A 31 year-old woman complained of sudden severe headache and collapsed. She had delivered by Cesarean section one week previously. She had a normal antenatal history and did not have any evidence of hypertension. RESULTS: Clinical examination revealed her to be in altered sensorium, GCS E2V2M5 with reduced movements on the left side. CT scan showed a large right putaminal hematoma with mass effect and midline shift. MRI also showed the hematoma but the MRV was normal. Despite antiedema measures and hyperventilation, the patient continued to deteriorate and so underwent right hemicraniectomy. MRA was done postoperatively and showed diffuse spasm of both middle cerebral arteries. A diagnosis of postpartum cerebral angiopathy was made and she was put on methylprednisolone and other antiedema measures were continued. With this she improved significantly. At one year she had residual hemiparesis but had returned to work. Four-vessel angiogram repeated 1 year later showed no arterial spasm. She later had cranioplasty to cover the defect. CONCLUSIONS: This case is presented to show that in a postpartum patient, if she presents with putaminal hematoma, postpartum angiopathy needs to be suspected and appropriate investigations and treatment, including steroids, should be given as the overall prognosis is good.
