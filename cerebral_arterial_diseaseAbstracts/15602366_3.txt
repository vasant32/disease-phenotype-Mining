BACKGROUND: Postpartum is known to be an important risk factor for stroke. Bromocriptine may induce cerebral angiopathy. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 26-year-old postpartum woman who presented with headaches, seizures, hypertension and acute renal failure eight days after the beginning of a treatment with bromocriptine prescribed for lactation suppression. Brain MRI and MR angiogram excluded cortical vein thrombosis and revealed multiple abnormal areas of increased signal in the cortex with segmental arterial narrowings of intracranial vasculitis. The patient completely recovered within one week after drug withdrawal. Biological and radiological abnormalities were also reversible. Following the chronology bromocriptine was most likely responsible for this adverse cerebral and systemic event. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of bromocripine-related postpartum cerebral angiopathy, a rarely described but serious complication of bromocriptine used to prevent postpartum breast engorgement.
