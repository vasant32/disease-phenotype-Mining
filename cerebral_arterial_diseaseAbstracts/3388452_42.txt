Intracarotid urokinase infusion therapy was performed on 22 patients with evolving cerebral infarction due to acute thromboembolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Mean time from onset of symptoms to start of infusion and mean dosage of urokinase were 4.5 hours and 927,000 units, respectively. Immediate recanalization was achieved in 10 patients (45%) after urokinase therapy. In patients with successful recanalization, rapid amelioration of symptoms followed the restoration of blood flow. Thrombolytic recanalization was associated with reduction of neurologic deficits and of computed tomography-demonstrable infarction volume. The reduction of infarction volume and functional outcome correlated highly with the degree of reflow. Hemorrhagic transformation of infarction occurred in four patients and controllable extracranial bleeding in three patients. These results support the safety and efficacy of urokinase therapy for acute thromboembolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.
