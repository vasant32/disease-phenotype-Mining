Angioplasty and stenting in symptomatic intracranial stenosis is technically possible and may reduce the risk of stroke in patients with symptomatic arterial stenosis. We report a patient with P1 segment stenosis of posterior cerebral artery treated successfully with angioplasty and stenting with a favorable outcome. He had 5 years of clinical and imaging follow-up and no in-stent stenosis or new ischemic event was observed.
