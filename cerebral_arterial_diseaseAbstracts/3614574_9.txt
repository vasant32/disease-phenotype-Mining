Four women, aged 39 to 46 years, were urgently admitted to our neurosurgical unit after strokes. On admission, all appeared moribund, presenting with deep coma, pupils bilaterally dilated and fixed, decerebrate posture, and markedly abnormal respiratory patterns. Computed tomography revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with an associated large intracerebral hematoma and pronounced shift of midline structures in all four cases. Because of the clinical appearance, the patients were given urea and were operated without preceding angiography. The origin of the hemorrhage was identified as a middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation berry aneurysm in one patient and giant MCA aneurysms in the other three. The hematomas were evacuated, and the aneurysms were occluded. All four patients received intravenous nimodipine, none showed any sign of delayed ischemic deterioration, and all regained full consciousness within a few days. One patient died 3 weeks later from a pulmonary embolus. Three patients are presently at home with moderate focal neurological deficits and moderate to marked cognitive impairment. The psychosocial readjustment was very good in a patient with a left giant aneurysm, satisfactory in a patient with a right giant aneurysm, and unsatisfactory in a patient with a right berry aneurysm. The indications, ethical considerations, and technical aspects of operating on seemingly moribund patients who probably harbor a ruptured MCA aneurysm are discussed.
