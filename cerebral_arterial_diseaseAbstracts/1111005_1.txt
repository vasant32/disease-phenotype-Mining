Sequential brain scans were performed at various time intervals of up to four hours after injection of 99mTc pertechnetate in 108 patients who had previously undergone "routine" one-hour brain scans which were considered normal or equivocal. Forty-six patients were proved to have a discrete morphologic brain lesion. Pathologic processes were demonstrated by the sequential scanning technique in all but 6 cases. In nearly a third of these 46 patients (28%), careful observation of the progressive and subtle changes in radioactivity in the whole sequential scan series was necessary for detection of the lesions: they could not be appreciated on any single static scan when viewed independently.
