Chickenpox and herpes zoster ophthalmicus are caused by the same virus. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus can be followed by contralateral hemiparesis, which is thought to be caused by spread of varicella-zoster virus to blood vessels contiguous to the trigeminal nerve and its branches. We report what we believe to be the first case of a patient with chickenpox followed by hemiparesis in whom there was angiographic evidence of an associated vasculitis similar to that found with herpes zoster ophthalmicus.
