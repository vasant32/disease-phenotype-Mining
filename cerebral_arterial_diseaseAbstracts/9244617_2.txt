INTRODUCTION: Dolichoectasia of the intracranial arteries may give rise to ischaemic or haemorragic pathology and to compression phenomena. Joint dolichoectasia of the whole circle of Willis, in both the anterior and basilar portions extending to the main basal arteries is an unusual finding. CLINICAL CASE: We describe a 76 year old man who presented with vertigo with vertically downward nystagmus. On neuroimaging studies there was aneurysmal dilation of the left vertebral, basilar and both carotid arteries (in their supra-clinoid portion) and of both medial cerebral arteries. Transcraneal Doppler showed marked reduction in flow rate with normal morphology and pulsation. CONCLUSION: The combination of non-invasive techniques allows full, reliable evaluation of the swollen arteries and possible complications.
