 OBJECTIVE: To review notable aneurysm cases that required complex decision making from a single institution and to examine available literature when relevant to highlight evidence-based paradigms for treatment of complex aneurysms. METHODS: Case illustrations were used to highlight topics in complex aneurysm treatments. Reviews of the literature were conducted to evaluate the evidence for available treatment models. RESULTS: Current modalities for treating complex aneurysms involve endovascular and microsurgical tools. CONCLUSIONS: Innovations in both arms of the cerebrovascular field will continue to advance the field and provide novel approaches to these complex lesions.
