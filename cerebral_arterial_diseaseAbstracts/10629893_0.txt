Ten cases with chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease which presented cerebral arterial occlusion without showing extended high intensity area on their brain MRI T2 weighted imaging, were evaluated by MRI Perfusion-weighted imaging (PI) and correlated SPECT (123 I-IMP). Each average of PI parameter indicated misery perfusion, and was mostly detected by time to peak and rMTT imaging.
