We report two cases of asymptomatic occlusion of the main trunk of the cerebral artery associated with subcortical hemorrhage in the area fed by collateral circulation. The first patient, a 51-year-old female who had suffered from untreated hypertension for 20 years, was hospitalized in a state of coma. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a subcortical hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe as well as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Cerebral angiography disclosed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at its origin. The region normally supplied by the right anterior (ACA) and middle cerebral (MCA) arteries was supplied instead by the posterior cerebral artery via leptomeningeal anastomosis. The hematoma was removed and the patient was discharged 1 month later. The second patient was a 54-year-old female who had suffered from uncontrollable hypertension for 27 years and was hospitalized after sudden development of stupor, right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. CT demonstrated a subcortical hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe. Cerebral angiography disclosed occlusion of the left MCA at its origin. The area normally fed by the left MCA was supplied instead by the ACA by way of leptomeningeal anastomosis. One month after operation the patient was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation of right hemiparesis. Both of these middle-aged women had long-standing hypertension. The hemorrhages were thought to result from rupture of the leptomeningeal anastomosis, which had developed as collateral vessels. It is probable that the relatively weak leptomeningeal anastomosis could no longer withstand the increased blood flow brought on by the hypertension.
