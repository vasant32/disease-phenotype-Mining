Disturbances of calculation were studied in 76 patients with arterio-venous aneurysms, located in the left and right hemisphere. An analysis of errors made by the patients in the process of calculation makes it possible to assume that in the organization of calculation functions, both hemispheres are involved, but the different stages of it have different morphological and functional bases. It was demonstrated that the right hemisphere provides the proceeding of the most automatized links during calculation.
