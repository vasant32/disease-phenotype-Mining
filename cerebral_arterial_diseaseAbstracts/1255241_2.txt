Cerebral angiography, performed after a seizure in a patient with a life-long history of typical hemiplegic migraine, disclosed markedly dolichoectatic anterior and middle cerebral arteries. No abnormality of the adjacent capillary or venous structures was present. A positive brain scan was attributed to ischemia induced by vasospasm rather than to the corresponding large tortuous anterior and middle cerebral arteries. There were no permanent sequelae and the patient has been free of seizures on Dilantin and phenobarbital over a 3-year follow-up period. Angiographic demonstration or description of a similar ectatic set of anterior and middle cerebral arteries could not be found in the literature. The concurrence of seizures and hemiplegic migraine adds to the peculiarity of this case.
