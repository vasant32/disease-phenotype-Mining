AIM: A new data acquisition system for transcranial 3 D-ultrasonography was used. The present study examines the evaluation of intracranial cerebral arteries by 3 D-ultrasound and echo contrast agents in comparison to cerebral angiography. METHODS: Ten patients, who underwent diagnostic cerebral angiography, were examined without knowledge of the angiographic results. Data acquisition through the transtemporal acoustic bone window was performed with a magnetic sensor system to track the spatial orientation of the ultrasound probe while scanning the volume of interest. We used a transcranial duplex system with power mode and stored a 3 D-data set before injection of transpulmonary stable contrast medium and afterwards. RESULTS: Ipsilateral to the transducer anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 90%, middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 90%, three or more branches of MCA in 60% and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in 40% were analysed without injecting an echo contrast agent. After the contrast injection ACA, MCA, branches of MCA and PCA in 100% were visible. In 70% of cases the posterior and anterior communicating arteries were visualised only by means of a contrast agent. CONCLUSION: Application of a transpulmonary stable ultrasound contrast agent in combination with 3 D transcranial duplex ultrasonography significantly enhances the visualisation of intracranial arteries.
