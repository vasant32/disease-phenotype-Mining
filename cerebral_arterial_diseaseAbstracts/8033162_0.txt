Three cases of middle cerebral artery occlusion in children are reported. The origin of M1 was the site of occlusion in two cases, while occlusion 1 cm after the origin of M1 was found in the third. The possible etiological diagnosis was infectious arteritis in the first two cases, cranial trauma in the third. In no case were serious contralateral motor deficits detected in follow-up examinations. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography showed complete regression of arterial lesions in the second case. The authors conclude that middle cerebral artery occlusion may have a benign clinical course in children; surgical revascularization is indicated only in highly selected cases.
