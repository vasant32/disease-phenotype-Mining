Arterial thrombo-embolism is an unusual complication in inflammatory bowel disease in adults and children. Cerebral arterial disease has been reported on only a few occasions. There are only two previous case reports of arterial disease occurring in a child with Crohn disease. However in both instances the arterial disease was part of a generalised Takayasu arteritis which resulted in multi-organ involvement. This report describes a 14-year-old boy who developed seizures before a histological diagnosis of Crohn disease was made. These seizures were the result of a vascular lesion which was confined to the right middle cerebral artery. CONCLUSION. Crohn disease as well as ulcerative colitis should be considered as a possible cause of cerebrovascular accidents in children.
