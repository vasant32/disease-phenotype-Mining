A 49-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of severe headache and dizziness which had occurred suddenly one day before admission. There was no past history contributory to cerebral hemorrhage but was family history of cerebrovascular accidents in his father and brother. Neurological examination revealed left homonymous hemianopsia, mild left hemiparesis, and left side hemi-neglect in simultaneous stimuli on bilateral extremities. Laboratory data including peripheral blood cells, coagulation tests, and serum chemistry were unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI demonstrated large lobar hematoma in the right parieto-occipito-temporal region. Cystatin C level in the CSF samples taken on the 39th and 59 th days (38 and 27 ng/ml respectively) were low, compared with the normal value (greater than 100 ng/ml). These findings suggest that the lobar cerebral hemorrhage of the present case might have been caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy with cystatin C deposits.
