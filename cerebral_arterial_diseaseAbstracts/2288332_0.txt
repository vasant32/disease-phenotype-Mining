The abrupt flow of blood in the meninges or in the brain after fissure or rupture of an arterial aneurysm still remains a medico-surgical emergency which includes the mobilisation of important technical and financial means which justifies itself by the reduction of the occurrence of a more severe accident and to give the patient its best chances. The cure of a cerebral aneurysm and its intracranial consequences must not be dissociated from its clinical context. Surgical indication must take into account the cause of the vascular lesion, the background on which it has evoked, its natural outcome which is characterised by rebleeding and vasospasm. Surgical cure of intracranial aneurysm is one of the great achievement of modern surgery. A better understanding of the malformation, the improvement of neuro-anesthesia and intensive care, and the use of pre-operatoire adjuvants have considerably improved the surgical results over the years. At the moment, alternative treatment start to emerge such as selective vascular catheterism with ejectable balloon which become more feasible and seductive.
