Cerebral artery stenosis (CAS) has the same pathogenesis as coronary artery disease (CAD), but the coexistence of these two diseases has been rarely reported. To detect coexistent CAS in CAD patients, we conducted a study of simultaneous coronary and cerebral angiography. Of the 663 consecutive newly diagnosed CAD patients who had not yet been explored to have CAS, 80 were admitted to undergo angiography of bilateral carotid and vertebral system during the same procedure. We defined significant vascular stenosis, either located intracranially or extracranially, as the lesions of diameter stenosis more than 50%. Association between carotid or vertebral stenosis and their potential risk factors were also analyzed. Of our patients, 18 (22.5%) had significant extracranial vascular stenosis, 14 (17.5%) suffered from intracranial stenosis, and 20 (25%) had both. Only 28 patients (35%) had no significant intracranial or extracranial stenosis. None of the demographic parameters as hypertension or diabetes showed significant differences between the cerebral patent group and the CAS group, except for the number of coronary stenotic vessels (1.71 +/- 0.81 versus 2.69 +/- 0.64, P < 0.001). The number of coronary stenotic vessels is correlated well to the number of cerebral stenotic lesions (r = 0.562, P < 0.001). Besides, 8 of the cerebral stenotic patients and 2 of the cerebral patent patients had ischemic stroke previously. We conclude the CAS is coexistent in more than half of the CAD patients in this study. Our study also implies a proportional increase in the severity of CAS to CAD severity.
