With computed tomography, dilated tortuous carotid and/or basilar arteries appear as tubular, fusiform or ring-shaped densities on the non-enhanced scan, or they may only be apparent after iodine injection. They can be differentiated by their shape and anatomic location. They may be multiple and are mostly seen in patients with a long history of atherosclerosis and hypertension.
