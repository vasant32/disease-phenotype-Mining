We investigated the effects of AT-877, a Ca2+ antagonist, on rat middle-cerebral artery occlusion. All rats had 6-h ischemia, and treated animals received either 3 or 10 mg/kg AT-877 s.c. just after the occlusion. Control animals received an equal volume of the vehicle. Prior to sacrifice, significant changes in the decrease of blood pressure and the increase of plasma glucose were observed in the treated rats. Although the infarct size tended to decrease, this decrease was not significant. Only when the blood pressure- or plasma glucose-matched subgroups were compared, the infarct volume decreased significantly in the drug-treated animals. Thus, AT-877 failed to reduce ischemic brain damage unless the blood pressure or plasma glucose were controlled.
