Cerebral arterial occlusion, occurring during monozygotic twin pregnancies, is a well known entity, specially when one twin is stillborn or macerated. Most of the authors consider that the aetiology is either embolization from the dead fetus or intravascular coagulation causing embolization in the surviving co-twin via placental vascular connections. Some data suggest an infectious endarteritis on the basis of angiographic and histological findings. Clinical features may appear several weeks after birth. CT scan and pathological findings depend on the date of the arterial occlusion. Four recent cases are described, two of them concerning monozygotic twin pregnancies. Pathological, CI scan, clinical features and pathogenesis are discussed taking account of the others data in the literature.
