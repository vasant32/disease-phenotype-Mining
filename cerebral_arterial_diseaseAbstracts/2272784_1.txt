A 67-year-old man presented four recurrent, alternating facial palsies, two right abducens palsies and eventually a right extrinsic third nerve palsy due to brain-stem infarction in a 37-year time-span. Neuroradiological examinations showed hydrocephalus and an elongated, tortuous, ectasic basilar artery. This patient presented in his lifetime the whole clinical spectrum of the dolichoectasic basilar artery complications.
