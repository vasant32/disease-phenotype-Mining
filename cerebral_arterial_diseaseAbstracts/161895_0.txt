The clinical and angiographic findings in a 23-year-old patient with hyperlipoproteinaemia type IV are described. The patient had suffered repeated, transitory attacks of focal cerebral ischaemia. During angiography, occlusion of a branch of the left middle cerebral artery occurred. This was followed by severe neurological deficit, which, however, recovered completely after three days. The pathogenesis of the angiographic findings and of this complication are discussed.
