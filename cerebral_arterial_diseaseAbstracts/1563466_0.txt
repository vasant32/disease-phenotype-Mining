A 55-year-old previously healthy woman developed disseminated neurological symptoms together with an organic psychosis over a period of several months. The symptoms progressed continuously despite all therapeutic attempts, and finally the patient died in a state of tetraparesis and coma. Brain biopsy showed necrosis and gliosis of the white matter, but no vasculitic changes. Autopsy revealed numerous necroses of the cerebral cortex and white matter. Signs of inflammation were absent throughout the whole brain. The adventitia of the brain-supplying arteries, especially both carotid arteries, showed a marked cellular infiltrate that consisted mainly of plasma cells and foam cells. The findings represent an unusual type of cerebral vasculitis whose etiology and pathogenesis are unknown.
