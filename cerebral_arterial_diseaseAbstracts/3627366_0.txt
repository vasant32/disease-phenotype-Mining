To elucidate hemodynamic changes and prognosis after STA-MCA anastomosis, thirteen cases with middle cerebral artery stenosis were systematically analyzed from the pre- and postoperative findings of cerebral angiography, CT scan and rCBF. They were followed up about 3 years long on the average postoperatively. Postoperative angiography revealed patent bypass in all cases. No remarkable changes at the site of stenosis were observed in the group A (6 in 13 cases), who had angiographically sufficient inherent collateral circulation. By contrast, group B (7 in 13 cases), who had insufficient inherent collateral circulation, showed remarkable progress in the degree of stenosis and significant changes of flow patterns were observed after operation. However, these postoperative changes did not bring any clinical deterioration. During follow-up period (31.2 months on the average) after operation, no cerebrovascular accident were encountered in all cases and clinically improved. In conclusion, the STA-MCA bypass rendered more beneficial effect to the patient with MCA stenosis when compared with natural histories reported in the literature.
