We present a case in which angioplasty alone and stent-assisted angioplasty were performed in the same patient to treat medically refractory intracranial stenoses. This elderly patient with presumed intracranial atherosclerotic disease underwent angioplasty alone for his anterior cerebral artery stenosis. Stent-assisted angioplasty was used for treatment of his ipsilateral middle cerebral artery stenosis. Follow-up angiography at 4 months documented severe recurrent stenosis confined only to the stented portion of the middle cerebral artery.
