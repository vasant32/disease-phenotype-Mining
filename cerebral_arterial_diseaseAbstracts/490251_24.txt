Computed tomography showed multiple cystic lesions in the brains of three infants with cerebral palsy. Each patient was the product of a twin pregnancy with a stillborn, macerated co-twin. In two patients angiography was performed and suggested that the cystic lesions were multicystic encephalomalacia due to perinatal arterial occlusion.
