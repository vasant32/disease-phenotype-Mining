BACKGROUND: The complex clinical and radiological picture of leptomeningeal spread of tumor is well recognized as a problem of systemic cancer but is less frequent in primary cerebral glioma, particularly as a presenting picture. While brain ischemia and infarction may occur in patients with subarachnoid tumor, the mechanism for these complications remains unclear. Angiographic and pathological demonstrations of direct vascular involvement by disseminated glioma are particularly sparse. We report a patient presenting with multiple infarctlike lesions with postmortem evidence of direct vascular involvement by glioma. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old woman presenting with seizures, headache, and changes in mental status was found to have vascular narrowing in cerebral blood vessels and ischemic lesions on neuroimaging studies of the brain, interpreted as cerebral vasculitis. A brain biopsy showed leptomeningeal glioma. Postmortem examination demonstrated a glioblastoma arising around the right sylvian fissure with extensive subarachnoid dissemination of tumor. The leptomeningeal tumor caused vascular narrowing by encasement, direct vascular wall invasion, and thrombosis and was associated with underlying infarctlike foci of parenchymal necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of glioblastoma clinically and radiographically mimicking cerebral vasculitis, and it illustrates a variety of mechanisms for tumor-produced vascular compromise.
