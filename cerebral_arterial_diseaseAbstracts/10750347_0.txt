Patients with ischemic heart disease are often complicated with cerebrovascular disease. The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of Xe-CT CBF study in patients with cerebral arterial occlusive disease before cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. This study was carried out in 11 patients suffered from ischemic heart disease with cerebrovascular diseases. They had severe stenoses or occlusions of cerebral arteries. Cerebral hemodynamics was measured by Xe-CT. There were no ischemic complications in the brain or heart during the study. Hemispheric CBF in the occlusive side is lower than that in the non-occlusive side. Cerebral ischemic events occurred in one patient after the cardiac surgery. Xe-CT CBF study can be performed safely in patients with ischemic heart disease. The patients with low CBF and low cerebrovascular reserve, had a greater risk of cerebral complication after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
