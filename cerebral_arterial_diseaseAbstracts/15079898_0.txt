An ischemic cerebral affection zone amounting to 22.51 +/- 3.0% of the ipsilateral hemisphere volume was found on the frontal brain sections in the frontoparietal cortex of rats 72 h after occlusion of the distal branch of the medial cerebral artery. The new nootropic drug nooglutyl [N-(5-hydroxynicotinoyl)-L-glutamic acid] in a dose of 10 mg/kg, as well as mexidol or phenyl-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) in a dose of 100 mg/kg, introduced into the vein at the moment of occlusion and intraperitoneally for two days after operation, effectively restricted the affected zone: nooglutyl, up to 7.6 +/- 2.28%; mexidol, up to 9.55 +/- 1.9%; and PBN, up to 12.8 +/- 1.7% of the ipsilateral hemisphere volume. On the third day after operation, animals preliminarily learnt to the passive avoidance conditioned reflex exhibited violated memory retrieval. The retrieval was significantly improved in the test animals treated with mexidol and especially nooglutyl.
