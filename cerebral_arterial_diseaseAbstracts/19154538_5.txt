BACKGROUND: Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis. It was reported that PAI-1 gene polymorphisms affected PAI-1 level and might therefore influence the risk of vascular diseases, including stroke. We studied the association of three common polymorphisms in PAI-1 gene (-844 G/A, -675 4G/5G, and HindIII G/C) with the odds of different causes of ischemic stroke. METHODS: We studied 390 patients with ischemic stroke due to large vessel disease (n = 117), small vessel disease (n = 121), and cardioembolism (n = 152) as well as 291 controls. The etiology of ischemic stroke was established using TOAST criteria. PAI-1 polymorphisms were genotyped with restriction fragment length polymorphism and single strand conformation polymorphism method. RESULTS: A-G-4G haplotype of PAI-1 gene was found more frequently in stroke patients with small vessel disease than in control subjects (44.9% vs 35.7%; P = 0.02). No association was found between investigated genotype or allele frequencies and distinct causes of ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that A-G-4G PAI-1 gene haplotype is associated with increased risk of small vessel disease stroke, but this study does not support an association of -844 G/A, -675 4G/5G, and HindIII G/C PAI-1 gene polymorphisms with particular etiology of ischemic stroke.
