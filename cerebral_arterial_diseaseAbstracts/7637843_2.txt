The authors report a case of dural arteriovenous malformation (dAVM) in the anterior fossa that was associated with an occlusion of the unilateral middle cerebral artery with Moyamoya phenomenon. The patient was a 79-year-old man referred to our department with an episode of consciousness disturbance and headache. Computed tomography scan showed intracerebral hematoma in the left frontal lobe, combined with left frontal subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography revealed dAVM in the left anterior fossa, fed by the bilateral ethmoidal and the bilateral middle meningeal arteries, and draining into the superior and inferior sinuses through the pial veins with vascular sacs. While angiography revealed an occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (M1 portion) good collaterals via leptomeningeal anastomosis had developed. T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images showed an intracerebral hematoma as a low intensity area, and flow-void areas were indicative of vascular sacs. Time-of-flight MR angiography also clearly showed dAVM in the left anterior fossa. Co-existence of an occlusion of an intracranial major artery and dAVM in this location has not been reported previously and it was speculated that this association had occurred by chance.
