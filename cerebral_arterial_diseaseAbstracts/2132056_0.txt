The results of angiographic examinations are presented in relation to the development of ischaemic stroke in 219 patients. In the selection of the patients cases were ruled out with coexistent intracranial haematomas, and the patients treated surgically were ruled out in whom the course of the operation suggested a possible influence of additional factors which might have changed the condition of the patient independently of the main disease. Depending on the results of angiography three groups of patients were isolated with different likelihood of ischaemic stroke development: patients without vasospasm or with segmental vasospasm-stroke developed in 15%-9% of cases; patients with unilateral or bilateral diffuse vasospasm of low or medium intensity-stroke in 34%; patients with high-grade diffuse intensity-stroke in 73% of cases. The frequency of stroke in these groups is analysed in relation to the condition of the patient at the time of angiographic examination.
