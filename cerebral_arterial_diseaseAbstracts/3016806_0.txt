In 43 children and adolescents, DSA was carried out, in 29 cases by the intravenous and in 17 cases by the intra-arterial route. IV-DSA was usually performed by putting a cannula (14 to 18 G) into the antecubital vein (bolus injection of 5 to 40 ml. of contrast and 5 to 20 ml. saline at 2 to 12 ml./sec.). The indication for IV-DSA is the investigation of congenital cardio-vascular abnormalities (stenosis or atresia of the pulmonary artery, anomalies of the pulmonary veins or the aortic arch and following vascular surgery). In these cases the more invasive heart catheter examinations can be avoided. IA-DSA is performed with a catheter with a fine lumen (4 to 5 F), diluting the contrast with an equal amount of saline. The advantage of IA-DSA is that it is less invasive, uses less contrast and provides better contrast and detail.
