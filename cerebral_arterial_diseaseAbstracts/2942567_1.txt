A case of occipital infarction following herpes zoster involving the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve is presented. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is followed occasionally by an angiitis and cerebral infarction, usually manifest as a hemiplegia. Cerebral angiitis has not been reported previously following herpes zoster involving the maxillary or mandibular divisions. Patients with herpes zoster involving any trigeminal division may be at risk for delayed stroke. The distribution of rash and angiitis in this case supports the hypothesis that the virus extends directly to the large vessels adjacent to the gasserian ganglion, instead of being transmitted along intracranial nerves.
