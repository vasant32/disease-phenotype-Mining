BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral vasoreactivity is an important indicator of the reserve capacity of the cerebral circulation. To make a quantitative analysis of cerebral vasoreactivity in individual major arterial territories, we evaluated the response to acetazolamide using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. METHODS: We examined 10 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with unilateral stenosis of the middle cerebral artery by a 1.5-T superconducting magnetic resonance imaging system. After a baseline vascular image was obtained, each subject received 17 mg/kg IV of acetazolamide; a second scan was performed 20 minutes later. Using a generally available personal computer and image analysis software, we measured the areas of the individual major arteries on collapsed axial vascular images and then calculated the vasoreactivity. RESULTS: The average vasoreactivity of individual major cerebral arterial territories in the healthy volunteers was as follows: anterior cerebral artery complex, 33%; right middle cerebral artery, 71%; left middle cerebral artery, 74%; right posterior cerebral artery, 68%; and left posterior cerebral artery, 68%. In the patient group, the vasoreactivity of the stenotic middle cerebral arteries was significantly smaller than that of the nonstenotic arteries (P < .05). In addition, the nonstenotic middle cerebral arteries showed significantly less vasoreactivity than the right arteries of the healthy volunteers (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography can be used to quantitatively evaluate acetazolamide-induced vasoreactivity in individual major cerebral arterial territories.
