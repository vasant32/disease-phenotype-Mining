OBJECTIVE: To expand the reported phenotypic range of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). BACKGROUND: Despite numerous patient reports, our knowledge of the phenotypic range of CADASIL remains incomplete. METHOD: We performed clinical, pathologic, and radiologic examinations on members of a family with CADASIL. RESULTS: The proband is a 61-year-old man with a history of migraine and depression who has experienced multiple subcortical infarctions resulting in a stepwise decline. Neuropsychological testing documented a dementia syndrome with frontal lobe features and neurologic examination noted a left hemiparesis and a right-sided palmomental reflex. Brain biopsy with light microscopy revealed a nonatherosclerotic small-vessel angiopathy with periodic acid-Schiff positive granular changes in the media and white matter gliosis, with unremarkable cortex. Genetic testing confirmed a Notch3 mutation. The proband's first cousin has a history of depression, one seizure possibly resulting from an acute stroke, and a learning disorder. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated deficits in executive function and neurologic examination noted persistent extraneous adventitial movements, poor coordination, and primitive reflexes. Skin biopsy with electron microscopy demonstrated granular osmiophilic material within the basement membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells, which is considered to be pathognomonic of CADASIL. The proband's older son and younger son have histories of migraine and depression, respectively, and both also had learning disorders. MRI revealed diffuse white matter disease extending into the temporal lobes, and lacunar infarctions in these four nonhypertensive patients. Other family members have experienced migraine, recurrent stroke, dementia, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: CADASIL is a genetic basis for vascular dementia that may be manifest earlier in life than previously reported.
