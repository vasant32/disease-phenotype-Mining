There is accumulating evidence that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are relevant to the formation of vascular complications in diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AGEs have a significant effect on tissue factor (TF) expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells compared with that in other arterial endothelial cells. Cultured bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells (BBMECs) and aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were incubated in medium containing glyceraldehyde-derived AGE (glycer-AGE). TF mRNA expression, protein expression, and activity were measured at multiple time points after glycer-AGE incubation. Participation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the effect of glycer-AGE on TF expression was investigated by treatment with a free radical scavenger, edaravone, and intracellular ROS measurements with dihydroethidium (DHE). Basic TF mRNA expression was greater in BBMECs than in BAECs. Glycer-AGE significantly upregulated TF mRNA expression in both cells, and the upregulation was more prominent in BBMECs than in BAECs. TF protein expression and activity were also upregulated with a pattern of being greater in BBMECs than in BAECs. Edaravone significantly attenuated the AGE-induced upregulation of TF mRNA expression, protein expression, and activity. Intracellular ROS levels measured with DHE-stained fluorescent intensity were significantly upregulated by glycer-AGE with a pattern of being greater in BBMECs than in BAECs. AGE-induced ROS upregulation was attenuated by edaravone like AGE-induced TF upregulation. These results suggest that brain microvascular endothelial cells are more susceptible to AGE-induced TF upregulation than aortic endothelial cells, and that this susceptibility is associated with levels of intracellular ROS.
