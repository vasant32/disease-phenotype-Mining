The neuroprotective effects of remacemide hydrochloride ((+/-)-2-amino-N-(1-methyl-1,2-diphenylethyl)acetamide hydrochloride) have been assessed with permanent occlusion of one middle cerebral artery in chloralose-anesthetized cats in which key physiologic variables have been monitored throughout the post-ischemic period. An infusion of remacemide hydrochloride (278 micrograms/kg/min; total dose 25 mg/kg) initiated 90 min prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion and discontinued at occlusion, reduced significantly (P < 0.02) the volume of ischemic damage (from 2505 +/- 454 mm3 of vehicle-treated cats to 1266 +/- 54 mm3 of remacemide hydrochloride-treated cats).
