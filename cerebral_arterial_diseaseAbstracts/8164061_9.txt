We describe two patients who developed devastating strokes due to intracranial arterial occlusion 15 weeks and 97 weeks following high dose stereotactic iodine-125 brachytherapy for glioblastoma multiforme. In both cases the occlusion was within the implant volume at points receiving 110-281 Gy and there was no other evidence of significant atherosclerosis in the patients. We therefore conclude that these complications were a direct result of the brachytherapy. The phenomenon of radiation-induced occlusion of large cerebral arteries is reviewed.
