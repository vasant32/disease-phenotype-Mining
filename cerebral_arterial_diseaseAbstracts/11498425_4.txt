We report two cases in which MR imaging was used to diagnose multiple cerebral aneurysms caused by cardiac myxoma. In one case, the diagnosis was confirmed with cerebral angiography. Myxomatous aneurysms characteristically appeared on T1-weighted images as contrast-enhancing focal fusiform dilatations of distal segments of the cerebral arteries. On T2-weighted images, these myxomatous aneurysms appeared as low signal intensity flow voids, sometimes associated with cerebral infarctions.
