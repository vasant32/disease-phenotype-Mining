PURPOSE: To demonstrate the spectrum of CT and MR imaging findings in patients with Wegener granulomatosis and to determine how often these findings could be attributed to either direct extension from paranasal or orbital disease sites, remote granulomas, or central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the CT or MR studies of 15 patients with Wegener granulomatosis. RESULTS: Abnormal findings were seen in 7 patients (5 examined with MR imaging, 2 with CT). Findings included dural thickening and contrast enhancement (3 patients), infarcts (2 patients), regions of hyperintense signal on T2-weighted MR images (2 patients), and abnormal MR signal in the brain stem (2 patients). Three patients with imaging findings of dural enhancement and thickening were thought to have remote granulomatous lesions involving the dura. No patients had extension from sites external to the CNS or clinical findings suggestive of CNS vasculitis. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of CT and MR findings in Wegener granulomatosis includes dural thickening and enhancements cerebral infarction, and MR signal abnormalities in the brain stem and white matter. Presumed remote granulomatous lesions were the most common causes of CNS findings in this study. Complications related to non-CNS disease (eg, hypertension, endocarditis) also appear to have played a role in some patients.
