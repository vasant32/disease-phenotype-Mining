The effects of antihypertensive treatment on the structural changes of middle cerebral arteries (MCA) were studied quantitatively and morphometrically in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Fifteen male SHR, 10 weeks of age, were divided into control and experimental groups. In the experimental group, the animals were administered hydralazine and guanethidine for the following 10 weeks. At the age of 20 weeks, mean arterial blood pressure of experimental animals was 177 +/- 9 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), being significantly lower than that of 195 +/- 12 mm Hg in control ones. Media thickness of large (external diameter greater than or equal to 200 micron) and medium sized MCA (150-200 micron) in treated SHR was 12.3 +/- 2.8 and 6.3 +/- 1.1 micron, respectively, being significantly smaller than that of 14.0 +/- 2.2 and 8.5 +/- 2.6 micron, respectively, in control SHR. The media cross-sectional area and the ratio of media thickness to external diameter were also significantly reduced by antihypertensive treatment. In the smaller vessels (75-150 micron), however, vascular morphometry revealed no difference between the two groups. Long-term antihypertensive treatment during the early phase of hypertension attenuates the development of medial hypertrophy in large cerebral arteries.
