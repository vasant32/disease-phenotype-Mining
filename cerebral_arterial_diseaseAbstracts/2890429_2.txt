Hairy cell leukemia was diagnosed in a 74-year-old man. He was followed for 5 years when he developed confusion and focal neurological signs. Despite investigation and treatment he died. Postmortem study revealed isolated primary necrotizing vasculitis affecting the cerebral arteries. No leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system was found. There is a recognized association between hairy cell leukemia and generalized necrotizing vasculitis of polyarteritis type, however, this is the first case report of isolated cerebral vasculitis associated with this condition. The importance of excluding infective (mycotic) arteries in this type of case is emphasized.
