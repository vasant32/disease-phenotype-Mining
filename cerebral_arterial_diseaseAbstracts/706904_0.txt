On the basis of a study of 192 cases with cerebral venous thrombosis (mainly thrombophlebites), including 135 verified cases, and analysis of literature data, the author indicate the character and causes of difficulties and errors in the diagnosis of such conditions. An objective ground for diagnostical difficulties is a significant polymorphism in the clinical picture. Diagnostical errors may also be due to insufficient knowledge of physicians of this form of pathology, a tendency to make "usual" clinical diagnoses. The paper contains a description of the clinical picture of cerebral venous thrombophlebitis with clinical examples promoting differential diagnosis.
