BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac right-to-left shunts (RLS) can be identified by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as well as by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) using contrast agents, such as Echovist-200 or Echovist-300 in conjunction with a Valsalva maneuver (VM) as provocation procedure. Both Echovist preparations are in use. Currently, the appropriate timing of the VM is still under debate. METHODS: Sixty-four patients were investigated by both TEE and bilateral TCD of the middle cerebral arteries. The following protocol was applied in a randomized way: (1) no VM, (2) VM for 5 s starting with the beginning of Echovist-300 injection, (3) VM for 5 s starting 5 s after the beginning of Echovist-300 injection, (4) VM for 5 s starting 10 s after the beginning of Echovist-300 injection, and (5) VM for 5 s starting 5 s after the beginning of Echovist-200 injection. RESULTS: In 27 patients, an RLS was demonstrated by both TEE and contrast TCD (shunt-positive). Twenty-two patients were negative in both investigations, no patient was positive on TEE but negative on TCD, 15 patients were only positive on at least one TCD investigation but negative on TEE. Tests 3 and 5 were the most appropriate ones; test 3 was slightly superior to test 5. CONCLUSIONS: TCD using Echovist-300 or Echovist-200 is a sensitive method to identify TEE-proven cardiac RLS. To achieve the best diagnostic accuracy, the VM should be performed for a duration of 5 s starting at 5 s following the beginning of contrast injection.
