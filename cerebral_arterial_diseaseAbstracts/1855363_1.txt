A method is presented which maintains mean arterial blood pressure at predetermined values during cerebrovascular occlusion studies in a rat model. The system consists of a pressure measurement apparatus, a pump capable of infusing and withdrawing fluids, and a personal computer to control the infusion and withdrawal rate. An evaluation of the system is presented, and potential advantages and difficulties are discussed.
