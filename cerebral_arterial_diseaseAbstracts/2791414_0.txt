Two patients with "my hand" sign in association with tactile extinction from callosal lesion, one due to left anterior cerebral artery occlusion, the other due to right anterior cerebral artery aneurysm rupture, were reported. The examination of "my hand" sign was performed with the methods proposed by Brion et al. Our patients correctly responded when they grasped their own or the examiner's thumb with their left hand. But they replied "my finger"when they grasped not only their own but also the examiner's thumb with their right hand. Left tactile extinction was observed after a routine extinction test in one patient, and it was observed in the other after the following method: both patient's index fingers were disposed in his midline position. In these methods of extinction test, they made errors in saying "right" when both fingers were touched simultaneously. However, they said "both" when their right index finger alone was touched (synchiria) during an extinction test using the following method: both index fingers of patients were approached by examiner to touch each other or for one of them to touch the examiner's finger. When they were asked whose finger they touched in this method (whose finger test), they made the same errors as seen in "my hand" sign test. These test results suggest that there is a common underlying mechanism in the "my hand" sign and extinction, because the sense of double stimulations felt when only one stimulation is given (synchiria), is a possible explanation for the "my hand" sign and the pathogenesis of synchiria appears to be related to extinction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
