Giant aneurysms have rarely been reported in association with intractable complex partial seizures (CPS). We report a 30-year-old man with intractable CPS since age 18 years. Seizure onset was electrically localized to right temporal lobe. Preoperative neuroimaging studies showed a partially thrombosed giant aneurysm of the right posterior cerebral artery. Selective amygdalohippocampectomy and occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery did not cause deficits. The patient has been seizure-free for 15 months after operation. We review the relevant literature on aneurysms as a cause of epilepsy.
