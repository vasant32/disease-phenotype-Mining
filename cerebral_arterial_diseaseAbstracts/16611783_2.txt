We present a case of traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the middle meningeal artery (demonstrated on CT angiogram) associated with epidural hematoma that spontaneously resolved without treatment. Follow-up CT angiogram and conventional angiogram done 2 weeks later demonstrated complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm. The literature suggests that these lesions require urgent treatment because they have a high mortality rate. We highlight the lack of proper data regarding the natural history of this disease and therefore lack of treatment guidelines.
