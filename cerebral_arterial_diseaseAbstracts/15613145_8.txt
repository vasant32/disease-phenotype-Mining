Elevated homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, thrombotic and cardiovascular diseases. The enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of homocysteine. A C677T mutation in this gene results in reduced activity. Sixty-nine patients with arterial stroke, six patients with venous stroke (confirmed by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) with hyperhomocysteinemia were selected for the study. Forty-nine subjects with no past history of stroke served as controls. MTHFR genotypes were determined by PCR using specific primers, followed by restriction digestion and gel analysis. The prevalence of the mutated homozygous and heterozygous C677T MTHFR genotype in the patients with arterial stroke was 1.4% (one of 69) and 31.88% (21 of 69), respectively. There frequency was 16.6% (one of six) and 33.3% (two of six) in venous stroke. The genotyping results from controls showed that there was only one heterozygote out of the 49 studied (2.08%). There was a significant difference between the control and the patient groups. Odds ratio for the probability of the C677T MTHFR gene mutation in the patients versus control group was 22.29 (95% CI 4.89-98.8). This indicates that C677T MTHFR mutation is strongly associated with arterial stroke especially in young adults. MTHFR allele evaluation will help in preventing/reducing morbidity caused by stroke.
