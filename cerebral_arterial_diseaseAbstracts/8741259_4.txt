The present study was designed to confirm the usefulness of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing strokes of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, hepatocellular carcinoma and hydronephrosis of each experimental rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-500 g), male SHRSP (ca. 250 g) and male F344 rats (ca. 300 g) were used for the investigation. Gadodiamide injection (Omniscan, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Nycomed AS, Norway) was administered intravenously as the contrast agent at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg except in hydronephrosis, where a dose of 0.05 mmol/kg was used. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained with a 1.5T or a 2.0T magnetic field strength MRI unit. The signal intensity of the stroke lesions was increased after administration of gadodiamide injection in SHRSP and MCA-occluded rats. Hepatocellular carcinoma was undetectable without the use of the contrast agent, but the signal intensity of the tumor increased after administration of the gadodiamide injection, allowing the lesions to be detected. The signal intensity of the renal medulla increased in the non-ligated kidney, but not in the hydronephrotic kidney. The information given by the post-contrast images were superior to those obtained from the pre-contrast images in all the models. Contrast effects in SHRSP and MCA-occluded rats were related to differences in capillary permeability, those in rats with hepatocellular carcinoma depended on differences in vascularity, and those in hydronephrotic rats depended on blood flow and permeability.
