We reviewed 1440 MRA studies to identify patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis (MCAS). We identified 99 cases, and after reviewing the clinical records, classified 28 as asymptomatic MCAS (AMCAS), a prevalence of 2%. Suspected stroke was the most frequent indication for MRA. Follow-up was available for 21, mean 46.7 months (range 2.4-75.6 months). One stroke occurred in the AMCAS territory (5%), other strokes in five patients (24%). There were five deaths in patients with MCAS; age > 69 (P = 0.045) was the only associated risk factor. This study suggests that patients in whom MRA is performed and shows AMCAS may be at increased risk of strokes in any vascular distribution or of death.
