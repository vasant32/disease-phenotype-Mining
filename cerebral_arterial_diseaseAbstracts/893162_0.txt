Dysarthria and aphasia represent primary symptoms of cerebral nerve dysfunction, and may particularly involve the facial and the hypoglossal nerves. In order for management to be effective, careful examination of the muscular functions of the oral cavity is required, with particular emphasis placed on the movements of the tongue and velum. Such evaluation, which utilizes both neuropsychologic and linguistic determinations, permit an accurate differentiation of the possible causes of aphasia to be made. During the evaluation, both verbal and non-verbal responses by the patient are included for proper diagnosis and therapy. Of great value in obtaining an accurate differential diagnosis is the exclusion of disturbances of hearing or buccofacial apraxia.
