Recent newly developed ultrasound (US) techniques extend our ability to study the cerebral hemodynamics in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM) beyond the conventional cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) analysis. We present US data of global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and global cerebral circulation time (CCT) in a patient with a unique bihemispherial diffuse cerebral angiomatosis and compare them with 10 age-matched controls. In addition, the estimation of an US-derived global cerebral blood volume (CBV) is proposed. Duplex sonographic CBF analysis revealed 2620 mL/min in the patient and 754 +/- 93 mL/min in controls. Doppler sonographic CCT was 2.9 s and 6.3 +/- 1.5 s and CBV 126 mL and 79 +/- 19 mL, respectively. US allows a simple, minimal invasive bedside analysis of several global hemodynamic parameters that might provide valuable additional information in patients with diffusely altered cerebral hemodynamics.
