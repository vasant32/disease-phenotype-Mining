BACKGROUND: Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusive disease usually produces homonymous visual field defects, hemisensory loss, and neuropsychological deficits. Conversely, the combination of hemiparesis, Horner's syndrome, and contralateral hemihyperhidrosis has never been reported before. CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient with infarction in the superficial and deep territories of the right PCA presented with a unique clinical picture, which included contralateral hemiparesis, hemihyperhidrosis, and ipsilateral Horner's syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed infarcts in the right anterolateral midbrain, ventroposterolateral thalamic-subthalamic area, and temporo-occipital lobes. CONCLUSIONS: The alternating vegetative syndrome (hemiplegia vegetativa alterna) observed in this patient supports the hypothesis of the existence of an uncrossed excitatory and a crossed inhibitory hypothalamospinal sympathetic pathway.
