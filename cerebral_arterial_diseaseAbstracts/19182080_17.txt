BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent placement has been applied in small case series as a rescue therapy in combination with different thrombolytic agents, percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA), and mechanical thromboembolectomy (MT) in acute stroke treatment. These studies report a considerable mortality and a high rate of intracranial hemorrhages when balloon-mounted stents were used. This study was performed to evaluate feasibility, efficacy, and safety of intracranial artery recanalization for acute ischemic stroke using a self-expandable stent. METHODS: All patients treated with an intracranial stent for acute cerebral artery occlusion were included. Treatment comprised intraarterial thrombolysis, thromboaspiration, MT, PTA, and stent placement. Recanalization result was assessed by follow-up angiography immediately after stent placement. Complications related to the procedure and outcome at 3 months were assessed. RESULTS: Twelve patients (median NIHSS 14, mean age 63 years) were treated with intracranial stents for acute ischemic stroke. Occlusions were located in the posterior vertebrobasilar circulation (n=6) and in the anterior circulation (n=6). Stent placement was feasible in all procedures and resulted in partial or complete recanalization (TIMI 2/3) in 92%. No vessel perforations, subarachnoid, or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages occurred. One dissection was found after thromboaspiration and PTA. Three patients (25%) had a good outcome (mRS 0 to 2), 3 (25%) a moderate outcome (mRS 3), and 6 (50%) a poor outcome (mRS 4 to 6). Mortality was 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial placement of a self-expandable stent for acute ischemic stroke is feasible and seems to be safe to achieve sufficient recanalization.
