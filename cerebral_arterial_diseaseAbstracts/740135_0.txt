The computed tomography (CT) characteristics and clinical features of giant (globoid) aneurysms of the anterior circulation are reviewed. These lesions appear on the CT scan as smoothly encapsulated ovoid masses, within which a partially patent lumen is seen after the infusion of iodinated contrast material. With careful analysis of the CT scan it may be possible to differentiate giant internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery aneurysms from other parasellar and hemispheric lesions.
