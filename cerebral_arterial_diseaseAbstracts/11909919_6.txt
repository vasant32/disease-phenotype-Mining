Two patients are described with the callosal type of alien hand syndrome. Both presented with abnormal feelings in the left upper limb and intermanual conflict without clinical evidence of callosal apraxia or frontal lobe dysfunction such as motor deficit or reflexive grasping. Imaging studies disclosed subacute infarction in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum due to pericallosal artery disease. These patients were unique in their presentation as a callosal type of alien hand syndrome secondary to ischaemic stroke.
