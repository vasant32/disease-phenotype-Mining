Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured during and after a 2-3 hour occlusion period of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in cats with the hydrogen clearance technique. The effects of mannitol upon rCBF were studied. Transient hypotension during occlusion dropped the blood flow to near zero on the occluded side, leading to postischemic hypoperfusion. Mannitol failed to modify blood flow during the occlusion period, but was effective in preventing any further decrease of blood flow during hypotension. Animals receiving mannitol had an improved postischemic recovery of blood flow. The correlation of ischemic severity and postischemic brain damage and the effects of mannitol on these parameters are discussed.
