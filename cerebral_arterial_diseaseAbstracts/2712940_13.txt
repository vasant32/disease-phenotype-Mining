A 4 1/2-year-old girl with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and prolonged varicella zoster virus skin infection developed multiple ischemic strokes and radiologic and histopathologic evidence of central nervous system vasculitis. Typical features of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome encephalitis were not present and there was no evidence of vasculitis outside the nervous system. Central nervous system vasculitis probably resulted from varicella zoster virus infection that persisted because of immunodeficiency. This acquired immunodeficiency syndrome complication has only rarely been described in adults and to our knowledge has not been described in children.
