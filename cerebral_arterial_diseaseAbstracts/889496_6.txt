Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in two patients with cerebral arteritis. One patient with methamphetamine-induced necrotizing angitis had a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage without an aneurysm. A second patient with ulcerative colitis developed an intracerebral hematoma. Carotid angiography demonstrated a diffuse arteritis in each patient. The risks of bleeding associated with cerebral arteritis are discussed. The use of anticoagulants should be avoided. Cerebral arteritis should be suspected as a cause for intracranial hemorrhage.
