AIM: We report the use of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) examinations in children (mean age 12.7 years; range 0.5-18 years) without an open fontanelle, using TCD equipment with a 2 MHz pulse wave transducer. Our results over a 7-year period are described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 858 children were referred from the paediatric outpatient department. All patients were divided into three groups according to the reason for referral. RESULTS: We found positive pathological results in the following: (1) headache and orthostatic dysregulation (0.4%, three out of 728); (2) acute neurological symptoms (5.4%, six out of 112); (3) other indications (22.2%, four out of 18). The positive predictive value of finding an abnormality was very low (0.50). CONCLUSION: TCD examination is ineffective in children with non-specific headache or orthostatic dysregulation due to the specific limitations of this method. We found a higher percentage of abnormal results in children referred for other indications. However, since these children usually undergo MR imaging (and MR angiography, if necessary), in our opinion the TCD examination does not add any additional information. The value of TCD in children is not in the primary diagnosis of disease but in the follow up of known vascular processes (e.g. stenoses) or in chronic diseases including angiitis and sickle cell disease.
