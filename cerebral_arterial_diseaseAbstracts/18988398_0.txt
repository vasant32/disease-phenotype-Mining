Vascular injuries after insertion of a Hickman line in neck are not uncommon. We present a case report of a patient of acute myeloid leukaemia with coagulopathy, who underwent right Hickman line insertion by a radiologist. She sustained a life threatening right subclavian artery injury which was managed by deploying endovascular covered stent. We recommend open surgical technique for Hickman line insertion under these circumstances after correction of coagulopathy.
