OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between factor V Leiden mutation and cerebral venous thrombosis in China. METHODS: 20 patients and 50 controls of Chinese origin were studied by polymerase chain reaction followed by Mnl I restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The PCR products of all the people supervised were digested to three segments with the length of 37 bp, 67 bp, and 116 bp. No factor V Leiden mutation was found in any subjects. CONCLUSION: Factor V Leiden mutation is not a crucial risk factor of cerebral venous thrombosis.
