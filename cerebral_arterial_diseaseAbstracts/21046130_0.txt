 PURPOSE: This study was carried out to determine the relationship between breast arterial calcification (BAC) and cerebral artery disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the relationship between BAC on mammography and cerebral artery-origin T2-hyperintensity on brain MRI and which is associated with an increased risk for stroke. A total of 168 women, ages 40-78 years, who underwent both mammography and brain MRI, were enrolled in this study. BAC was counted as positive if it was found on more than one view a breast. The T2-hyperintensity was systemically defined and graded as follows: punctuate; patchy; and confluent white-matter hyperintensity (WMH); caps; bands; and irregular periventricular hyperintensity (PVH). Patchy and confluent WMH and irregular PVH were considered as positive findings for cerebral artery disease. We also obtained data regarding cardiovascular risk factors that might function as confounding factors. Statistical analysis was performed for association of the BAC and positive MRI findings. RESULT: The presence of BAC showed a strong correlation with the positive MRI findings (Odds ratios, adjusted with statically significant cardiovascular factors of 6.86 for positive WMH and 9.04 for positive PVH, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The mammographic finding of BAC, which may be a useful marker of women at higher risk for stroke, should receive more of clinicians' attention and its presence should never be omitted from the report.
