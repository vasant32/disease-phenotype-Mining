The goals of this study were to 1) determine the acute effect of ANG-(1-7) on vascular tone in isolated middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) from Sprague-Dawley rats fed a normal salt (NS; 0.4% NaCl) diet, 2) evaluate the ability of chronic intravenous infusion of ANG-(1-7) (4 ng路kg(-1)路min(-1)) for 3 days to restore endothelium-dependent dilation to acetylcholine (ACh) in rats fed a high-salt (HS; 4% NaCl) diet, and 3) determine whether the amelioration of endothelial dysfunction by ANG-(1-7) infusion in rats fed a HS diet is different from the protective effect of low-dose ANG II infusion in salt-fed rats. MCAs from rats fed a NS diet dilated in response to exogenous ANG-(1-7) (10(-10)-10(-5) M). Chronic ANG-(1-7) infusion significantly reduced vascular superoxide levels and restored the nitric oxide-dependent dilation to ACh (10(-10)-10(-5) M) that was lost in MCAs of rats fed a HS diet. Acute vasodilation to ANG-(1-7) and the restoration of ACh-induced dilation by chronic ANG-(1-7) infusion in rats fed a HS diet were blocked by the Mas receptor antagonist [D-ALA(7)]-ANG-(1-7) or the ANG II type 2 receptor antagonist PD-123319 and unaffected by ANG II type 1 receptor blockade with losartan. The restoration of ACh-induced dilation in MCAs of HS-fed rats by chronic intravenous infusion of ANG II (5 ng路kg(-1)路min(-1)) was blocked by losartan and unaffected by d-ALA. These findings demonstrate that circulating ANG-(1-7), working via the Mas receptor, restores endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cerebral resistance arteries of animals fed a HS diet via mechanisms distinct from those activated by low-dose ANG II infusion.
