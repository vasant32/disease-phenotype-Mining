The Gr√∂nblad-Strandberg-Syndrome (Pseudoxanthoma elasticum) is a systemic disease of the elastic tissue, typical symptoms being lesion of skin and ocular fundi. The frequently appearing vascular changes, particularly of occlusive nature, are important for the patient's prognosis. Several clinical observations had led different authors to assume cerebrovascular involvement. Our neuroradiological findings support this opinion: In this report on a 45-year-old patient with acute hemisyndrome, we demonstrated, for the first time using computerized tomography, ischemic infarcts of both cerebral hemispheres. Cerebral angiography showed bilateral stenoses of the internal carotid arteries with further irregularities of the lumen of the intracranial arteries.
