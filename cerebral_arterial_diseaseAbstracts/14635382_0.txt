We present the case of a 73-year-old male with diffusely aneurysmal artery disease. Echocardiography revealed a 4.5 cm mass, adjacent to the right side of the heart, suggesting a diagnosis of coronary artery aneurysm. The findings were confirmed at magnetic resonance imaging and coronary angiography. Moreover, in view of the reported strong association between coronary and cerebral artery disease, the patient was submitted to cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, which also demonstrated aneurysmal disease involving the cerebral arteries.
