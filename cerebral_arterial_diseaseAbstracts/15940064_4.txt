PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the spatial resolution and accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) distance measurements performed with 3D angiography using various phantoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With a 3D angiography system, digital images with a 512 x 512 matrix were obtained with the C-arm sweep, which rotates at a speed of 30 degrees/second. A 3D comb phantom was designed to assess spatial resolution and artifacts at 3D angiography and consisted of six combs with different pitches: 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.9 mm, and 1.0 mm. Frame rate, field of view (FOV) size, reconstruction matrix, and direction of the phantom were changed. In order to investigate the accuracy of 3D distance measurements, aneurysm phantoms and stenosis phantoms were used. Aneurysm phantoms simulated intracranial saccular aneurysms and parent arteries; 2-mm- or 4-mm-inner-diameter cylinder and five different spheres (diameter: 10, 7, 5, 3, 2 mm) were used. Stenosis phantoms were designed to simulate intracranial steno-occlusive diseases; the nonpulsatile phantoms were made of four cylinders (diameter: 3.0, 3.6, 4.0, 5.0 mm) that had areas of 50% and 75% stenosis. The dimensions of the spheres and cylinders were measured on magnified multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images. RESULTS: The pitch of the 0.5 mm comb phantom was identified clearly on 3D images reconstructed with a frame rate of 30 frame/sec and 512(3) reconstruction mode. In any reconstruction matrixes and any angles of the phantom, the resolution and artifacts worsened when frame rates were decreased. With regard to the angle of the phantom to the axis of rotational angiography, spatial resolution and artifacts worsened with increase in angle. Spatial resolution and artifacts were better with a FOV of 7 x 7 inch than with one of 9 x 9 inch. All spheres on the aneurysm phantom were clearly demonstrated at any angle; measurement error of sphere size was 0.3 mm or less for 512(3) reconstruction. In 512(3) reconstruction, the error of percent stenosis was 3% or less except for a cylinder diameter of 3.0 mm and 5% for a cylinder diameter of 3.0 mm. CONCLUSION: Spatial resolution of the reconstructed 3D images in this system was 0.5 mm or less. Measurement error of sphere size was 0.3 mm or less when 512(3) reconstruction was used. When using proper imaging parameters and postprocessing methods, measurements of aneurysm size and percent stenosis on the reconstructed 3D angiograms were substantially reliable.
