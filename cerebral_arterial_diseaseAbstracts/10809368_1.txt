A 90 min ligation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) followed by 72-hour reperfusion appeared to cause calcium deposition in vascular myocytes of the tunica media and the perivascular tissue of the Sprague Dawley rat. The presence of small ovoid to large irregularly shaped intracellular opaque deposits were demonstrated by light and electron microscopy. Using X-ray elemental analysis the chemical nature of the deposits was found to be calcium phosphate. The functional significance of this first demonstration of acute calcification following transient ligation of the rodent MCA invites further studies.
