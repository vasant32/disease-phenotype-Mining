Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease characterized by multisystem involvement. Nervous system involvement is rare, with a reported incidence of 3%-13%. Brucellosis can also be manifested in the form of vasculopathy. Cerebral vasculopathy due to brucellosis is a very rare entity, with only a few cases reported in the literature. We present a patient with neurobrucellosis who had involvement of cerebral vasculature demonstrated by angiography.
