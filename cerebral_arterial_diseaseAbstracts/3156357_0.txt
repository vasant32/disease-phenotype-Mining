Thirty patients with previous cerebral ischaemic accident were explored by both computerized tomography (CT) and radionuclide tomography after injection of 123I-labelled N-isopropyl-iodo-amphetamine. All lesions that were visible at CT were also visible at radionuclide tomography. However, in 7 patients with normal CT results the latter method showed areas of cerebral activity anatomically correlated with neurological signs or vascular lesions. Cerebellar diaschisis was observed in 50% of established lesions in the carotid territory. Radionuclide tomography therefore appears as a very sensitive method to be used in ischaemic pathology with transient or regressive accidents.
