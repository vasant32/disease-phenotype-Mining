BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to examine the frequency and clinical relevance of intracranial artery stenoses in patients with bacterial meningitis in whom the occurrence of stroke has angiographically been reported to be associated with stenoses or occlusions of the large basal cerebral arteries. METHODS: Thirty-five unselected patients (24 men, 11 women; mean age, 51 +/- 18 years) with bacterial (n = 33) or fungal (n = 2) meningitis prospectively underwent serial transcranial Doppler sonography recordings of mean blood velocity (MBV) and pulsatility index in the middle (MCA) and anterior (ACA) cerebral arteries, as well as recordings of the ratio of the MBV of the MCA and internal carotid artery (MCA/ICA ratio) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 14, and 21 after admission. The results were correlated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (days 1 to 14), the occurrence of focal cerebral signs, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (short-term outcome, day 21). An MCA stenosis was diagnosed by an MBV of 120 cm/s or more or an MCA/ICA ratio of more than 3. An ACA stenosis was diagnosed by an MBV of 100 cm/s or more. RESULTS: Transient stenoses occurred most frequently between days 3 and 5 and were detected in 18 patients (51%). Seventeen patients remained without a stenosis. Patients with stenoses showed a significantly poorer mean Glasgow Coma Scale score from day 3 (9 +/- 4) to day 14 (11 +/- 4) than patients without a stenosis (day 3: 13 +/- 4, P < .01 by t test; day 14: 14 +/- 1, P < .05). The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score was not significantly different between both groups. The occurrence of mainly transient focal cerebral signs was significantly related to the number of narrowed vessels per patient (P < .05, chi 2 test). CONCLUSIONS: Stenoses of the intracranial arteries occur frequently in bacterial meningitis and are associated with a complicated course of the disease.
