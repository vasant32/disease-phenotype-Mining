A 47-year-old woman affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented with headache, fever, splenomegaly and edema of the lower extremities. CT showed diffuse low density in the cerebral white matter and marked splenomegaly in the abdomen. T2-weighted MR images showed diffuse high intensity lesions in the white matter. After immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone, there was marked improvement in the cranial CT and MR appearances. The underlying pathological process was probably edema secondary to a lupus microangiopathy. SLE can be complicated by a widespread abnormality of the white matter with marked radiological changes but few neurological signs. In the present case, only an episodic mild hemiparesis for 3 weeks without seizure and psychiatric disturbance was found neurologically during the whole clinical course.
