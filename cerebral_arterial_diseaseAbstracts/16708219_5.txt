The purpose of this study was to compare the image quality of two-dimensional (2D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) between a flat panel detector (FPD) of the direct conversion type with low radiation dose and a conventional image intensifier (I.I.)-TV system, and to assess 3D DSA with the FPD system in the depiction of intracranial vessels. Fifteen consecutive patients (five men, ten women; age range: 18-82 years; mean age: 55.5 years) were prospectively included in this study. All patients underwent 2D DSA with both the FPD and I.I.-TV system in one projection. The radiation doses during angiography were evaluated using a phantom. The 3D DSA images were created from the rotational DSA data with the FPD system. Two blinded radiologists independently evaluated 2D DSA with the FPD system and I.I.-TV system using a 5-point assessment scale (excellent to not visible) to assess the depiction of intracranial vessels. MIP and volume rendering (VR) images of 3D DSA with the FPD system were also evaluated using a 5-point scale (excellent to not visible). DSA and fluoroscopy dose measurements with the phantom showed a dose reduction of approximately 85% and 9% with the FPD system compared with the I.I.-TV system, respectively. For 2D DSA, the FPD system was significantly superior to the I.I.-TV system with respect to the visibility of the peripheral and perforating vessels (p<0.05). The peripheral and perforating vessels were also sufficiently visualized on MIP images of 3D DSA in all 15 cases. Our FPD system was found to be superior to the I.I.-TV system in visualizing small intracranial vessels combined with a significant reduction of radiation dose, and was able to create high-quality 3D DSA images on which high spatial resolution allowed precise visualization of small vessels such as perforating ones.
