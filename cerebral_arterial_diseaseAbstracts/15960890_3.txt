AIM: To study the protein and mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain of rats with atherosclerosis (AS) and the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) on expressions of cytokines. METHODS: The experimental model of AS in rats were established by intraperitioneal injection of vitamin D3 with high fat/cholesterol diet. GbE 100 mg/kg was administered to rats by ig. After 8 weeks, the expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-10R in the brain tissues of AS rats were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 in the brains were markedly higher in AS groups than that in control groups (6.11+/-0.15, 1.55+/-0.14, 0.54+/-0.04 ng/g wet weight vs 0.80+/-0.14, 0.33+/-0.09, and 0.33+/-0.02 ng/g wet weight, respectively). The protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the brains were markedly lower in GbE groups (3.82+/-0.54, 0.95+/-0.08 ng/g wet weight) than that in AS groups, the protein and mRNA expressions of IL-10 and IL-10R in the brains were markedly higher in GbE groups (0.85+/-0.06 ng/g wet weight) than that in AS groups. CONCLUSION: GbE inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, but up-regulated the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-10R in brain, which might be related with its anti-AS actions.
