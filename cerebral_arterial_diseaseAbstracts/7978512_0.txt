Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) uncommonly develops stroke, although collagen disease is an important condition for stroke. A nonhypertensive woman with MCTD developed massive putaminal hemorrhage. No obvious predisposing factors were revealed by clinical and pathologic examination. MCTD may contribute to the development of brain hemorrhage by some mechanism other than hypertension.
