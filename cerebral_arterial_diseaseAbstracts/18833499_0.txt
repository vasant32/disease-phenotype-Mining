In the last decade transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) was established as a routine in neurovascular departments for the evaluation of brain-supplying vessels in cerebrovascular diseases. TCCS has demonstrated feasibility and validity for the evaluation of the basal cerebral arteries, especially for the middle cerebral artery (MCA). In some patients an insufficient bone window may limit the diagnostic power. The application of microbubble agents can overcome this limitation in most patients. Beside the demonstration of vessel pathology such as stenosis and occlusion, TCCS also provides prognostic information. In the case of proximal MCA occlusion shown by TCCS within 6 hours of stroke, nearly 90 % of the patients suffered an unfavorable outcome. Furthermore TCCS is suitable for monitoring thrombolysis in acute stroke to detect whether there is recanalization of the affected vessel. The possibility for bedside examination, the non-invasiveness and the cost-effectiveness are features which make TCCS an optimal tool for the evaluation of cerebral vessels in acute ischemic stroke.
