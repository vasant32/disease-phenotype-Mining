We report the case of an 18 year-old woman treated for femoral osteogenic sarcoma who presented generalized seizures requiring sedation, tracheal intubation and artificial ventilation. CT brain scan showed diffuse hypodensities. Doppler studies showed an increased cerebral arterial resistance. Regional cerebral blood flow was decreased. A right carotid angiogram showed abnormalities consistent with diffuse cerebral arteritis. The patient slowly recovered and 6 weeks later, magnetic resonance imaging showed disseminated areas of hyposignal on T1 and hypersignal on T2 weighted images. We reviewed the different published cases of acute high dose methotrexate neurotoxicity and the different underlying mechanisms.
