Between 1967 and 1982, EC-IC anastomoses were performed on 143 patients with obstructive cerebrovascular lesions at our hospital. Bypasses were patent in 93% of these patients, which was verified by Doppler examination or by both Doppler exam and angiography. Half as many patients with a patent bypass experienced further cerebrovascular events, compared to the expected number if the problem was left untreated. Recovery from mild neurological deficits or completed stroke was observed in 23 patients. As clinical experience increases, it becomes clear that EC-IC anastomoses are an important and effective treatment for patients suffering from obstructive cerebrovascular disease.
