In 2 patients with infarction in the territory of the right anterior choroidal artery, hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia (in 1), and hemianopia or superior quadrantanopia were associated with severe multimodal hemineglect, without anosognosia, disorientation, or asomatognosia. Single-photon emission tomography showed that marked hypoperfusion was not limited to the right posterior capsular region, but also involved the overlying parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent the frontal cortex. At autopsy in 1 patient, the infarct was nearly limited to the deep white matter of the temporal isthmus and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule; only minute lesions were present in the globus pallidus, body of caudate, and amygdala. These findings are consistent with a disconnection phenomenon as the basis for subcortical neglect with ipsilateral deactivation of the parietofrontal cortex.
