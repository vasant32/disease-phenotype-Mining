 OBJECT: The purpose of this paper was to present the safety, efficacy, and clinical/angiographic follow-up results of HyperForm balloon-assisted endosaccular coil occlusion of distal anterior circulation bifurcation aneurysms. METHODS: Over a 7-year period, the authors treated 864 middle cerebral artery, distal anterior cerebral artery bifurcation, and anterior communicating artery aneurysms by means of coil embolization with HyperForm balloon assistance in 800 patients. In 37 aneurysms, 2 HyperForm balloons were used simultaneously for remodeling. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 7.1%, including 1.4% procedural mortality. Various neurological deficits were present at discharge in 8.9% of the patients, and 4.4% had permanent disabling morbidity 6 months posttreatment (modified Rankin Scale score â‰¥ 2). Thromboembolic complications developed during the treatment of 15 aneurysms (1.7%) causing morbidity or mortality in 10 cases (1.3%). There were 14 intraoperative perforations (1.6%). In all 14 cases, the HyperForm balloon saved patients from severe bleeding. The perforation led to morbidity or mortality in 3 cases (0.4%); there were no negative consequences in 11. There were 726 patients with 757 aneurysms (87.6%) available for follow-up. Control angiograms were obtained at 6 months in 386 patients, at 1 year in 267, and at 2 years in 104, revealing an 82% complete obliteration rate according to the most recent follow-up angiograms. CONCLUSIONS: The satisfactory results obtained in this experience demonstrate that HyperForm balloon remodeling provides strong benefits for the endovascular management of middle cerebral, anterior cerebral, and anterior communicating artery aneurysms without increasing the risk of treatment. Not only does this technique allow for the safe treatment of these aneurysms, but it also expands the indications of endovascular treatment to include aneurysms that otherwise cannot be treated with simple coil embolization.
