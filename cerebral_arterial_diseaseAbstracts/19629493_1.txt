INTRODUCTION: Pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery (STA) is usually caused by head or facial injury and is rarely reported in children. It is frequently discovered as a pulsatile cystic mass in the temple, and its diagnosis can be made with ultrasound or computerized tomography angiogram (CTA). Treatment modalities consist of surgical excision and endovascular embolization. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old boy presented with a pulsatile, cystic, and painless mass in the left anterior temporal region, developed 6 weeks after head injury from a traffic accident. The mass was 15 mm in diameter and compressible, and disappeared after manual compression of the proximal STA. Bruit was audible over the mass with a stethoscope. CTA showed a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior division of the left STA. The mass was resected with ligation of the proximal and distal ends of the STA. CONCLUSION: A pseudoaneurysm of the STA should be suspected in a child presented with a pulsatile, cystic mass in the temple, developed after head injury. It can be easily diagnosed with history and physical examination with the aid of imaging modalities such as Doppler ultrasonography and CTA. Pseudoaneurysms are usually successfully treated with excision.
