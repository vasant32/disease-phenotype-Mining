The cerebral angiograms of 11 patients suffering from collagen disease are presented. Panarteriitis nodosa was diagnosed in 4 cases, Lupus erythematodes in 2 cases. With 5 patients immunovasculitis with cerebral affection was found, which was, however, not to be classified in detail. More or less characteristic features are to be expected in the angiogram; they might harden the suspicion of collagen disease, although they are not likely to prove its diagnosis. An interpretation of the radiological findings should--in addition to the morphology--primarily take into account the distribution type of the vessel wall lesions. Clinically as well as by means of angiography it is difficult to differentiate between collagen disease and cerebral arteriitis of different aetiology; this applies particularly to the alterations in cases of embolic circumscribed encephalitis in sepsis lenta. The diagnostic value of angiography in cases of collagen disease with cerebral affection is discussed, the criteria of cerebral arteriitis of different aetiology are dealth with.
