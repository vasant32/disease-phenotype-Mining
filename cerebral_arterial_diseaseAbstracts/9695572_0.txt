Patients presenting with the major brain arteries (MBA) pathologies were examined by a novel diagnostic tool relying on prolonged latent evoked potentials in response to rotating stimulation (EPR), which allowed an objective quantitative assessment to be performed of central vestibular dysfunction. This approach in the form of a computer programme permitted the testing of patients presenting with MBA pathologies during the preclinical stage of the condition, prior to carrying out such complicated surgical studies as angiography. The EPS method is simple, cost-effective, and convenient in screening examinations, enabling the brain vascular pathology to be detected during the stage of early functional disorders.
