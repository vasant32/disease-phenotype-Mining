A case of temporal arteritis presenting with extrapyramidal symptoms (tremor, rigidity and extrapyramidal hypertonus) unresponsive to conventional treatment is here described. The onset of headache and laboratory abnormalities suggestive of temporal arteritis prompted a temporal artery biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis; the administration of corticosteroids led to the resolution of all symptoms.
