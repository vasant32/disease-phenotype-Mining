This report describes three patients, with acute cerebral arterial occlusion, treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). In one patient with basilar artery occlusion thrombolytic treatment was initiated 12 h after onset of the symptoms. In two patients with angiographically verified occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, the treatment was initiated approximately 4.5 h after onset of the symptoms. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator 80-120 mg, was infused intra-arterially over 90-100 min via a catheter the tip of which was close to the occlusion. This regimen resulted in recanalization in all the patients; however, in two patients it was verified by repeat CT scan only. In two patients the thrombolytic treatment was successful (the patients improved clinically); the third patient died of massive cerebral infarct-related oedema. In none of the patients did significant bleeding or other obvious side-effects occur. From this preliminary report it is concluded that angiographically proven thrombolytic recanalization in acute cerebrovascular occlusion is possible with rt-PA. In some patients, however, the treatment is initiated too late. Further investigation of the possible indication for thrombolytic therapy in stroke is needed.
