Occlusive disease of the major vascular structures of the head and neck produce classic findings on conventional angiography that are mirrored in the sequences obtained on intravenous dynamic computed tomography (IVDCT). As a complement of the initial computed tomographic (CT) workup, IVDCT provides immediate, important diagnostic information, helps to direct appropriate clinico-radiologic triage with minimum delay, and may obviate more invasive studies in selected clinical settings.
