Seven cases of ruptured cerebral aneurysm associated with an occlusion of a large cerebral artery are reported. All seven patients had never suffered from ischemic cerebrovascular disease before the aneurysmal rupture. All nine aneurysms, including the two unruptured ones, arose on the artery serving as an important collateral pathway, and eight of the nine were found in locations where saccular aneurysms are known to occur infrequently. The role of hemodynamic factors in the pathogenesis of these aneurysms is stressed.
