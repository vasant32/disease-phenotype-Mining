Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized clinically by recurrent cerebral infarcts, subcortical dementia and pseudobulbar palsy, and morphologically by a granular degeneration of cerebral and, to a lesser degree, extracerebral blood vessels. We present morphological findings in a further German family affected by CADASIL. The index case showed the typical periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in cerebral vessels, which did not react with antibodies against various immunoglobulins or complement factors. Ultrastructurally, granular osmiophilic material (GOM) covered the VSMC in different cerebral regions as well as in extracerebral organs (muscle, nerve, skin, small and large intestine, liver, kidney and heart). Skin biopsy samples from other family members of the last two generations also revealed GOM irrespective of the clinical symptomatology (CADASIL, migraine only or asymptomatic). Patients in the third generation had higher amounts of GOM in skin vessels than did asymptomatic or migraine patients in the fourth generation. We conclude that skin biopsy is a useful and less invasive screening method for the differential diagnosis of CADASIL.
