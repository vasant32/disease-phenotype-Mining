Rapid occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was undertaken in 5-6 week old rats to determine whether or not the young spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) or the normotensive Sprague-Dawley rat (SD) is protected against cerebral infarction by collateral circulation. Rats were killed 3 days after MCA occlusion and administration of Evans blue. As compared to SD, the SHR had elevated blood pressure prior to MCA occlusion, large cortical infarcts marked with Evans blue, and motor deficits contralateral to the occluded MCA. SHR did not develop an adequate collateral circulation, but SD were protected from infarction by it. Because the cerebral lesions were in young spontaneously hypertensive rats living prior to the established form of hypertension, the increased susceptibility to infarction was not secondary to it. Since normotensive rats usually do not infarct after sudden MCA occlusion, the infarction trait may be linked to the mechanism causing elevated blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
