The purpose of the study was determination of the incidence of arteriospasm in the brain in relation to the time after the last bleeding to the time of angiography. The authors analysed 209 cases of bleeding in which one-time angiography of the carotid arteries was done. In 45% of cases arteriospasm was found. The lowest incidence of arteriospasm was observed 1-3 days after the last bleeding, and highest on days 7-9 after this bleeding.
