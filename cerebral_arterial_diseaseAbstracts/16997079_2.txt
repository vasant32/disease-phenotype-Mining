The differences between two models of cerebral ischemia [middle cerebral arterial transection (MCAT) and cortical photothrombosis (PT)] were explored with multiparametric MRI of apparent diffusion coefficient trace (ADCtr), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and T1. Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) immunoreactivity sections aligned with the MR images in the same coronal plane were used to map the infarct and to guide region-of-interest selection. In ischemic cortex, the larger T1 increase in PT versus MCAT (42+/-7% vs. 16+/-5%) is related to the different character of edema between these models; yet, neither CBF nor ADCtr discriminated between them at 3.5 h, suggesting that different mechanisms of ischemic damage to the brain cells resulted in the same ADCtr value. CBF and ADCtr were depressed in immediately adjacent ischemic border by 27+/-7% and 47+/-10%, respectively, in MCAT but not in PT, suggesting marginal perfusion in MCAT. CBF in homotopic normal cortex in the opposite hemisphere was higher for PT compared with MCAT (199+/-20 and 134+/-10 ml/100 g/min, respectively). Different pathological processes in the two models affect CBF, ADCtr and T1 in a unique, regionally specific manner. The PT model differs substantially from the MCAT and is not a model of cortical ischemia with an appreciable border zone.
