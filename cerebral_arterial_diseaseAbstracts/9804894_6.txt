The neuroprotective effect of post-ischemic treatment with the novel, highly water-soluble, glutamate AMPA receptor antagonist YM872 was evaluated by using MR imaging and histopathology of rats subjected to permanent MCA occlusion. Two treatment groups with continuous i.v. infusion of 20 mg kg-1 h-1 YM872 during either the first 4 h or first 24 h after MCA occlusion, called 4 h YM872 treatment group (n=9) and 24 h YM872 treatment group (n=8) respectively, were compared to a control group (n=8). The main end-point was T2 weighted MR imaging and histopathology 24 h after MCA occlusion. Also the time evolution of the ischemic tissue damage was studied by diffusion weighted MR imaging 412 and 24 h after MCA occlusion. The volume of ischemic tissue damage as assessed by diffusion weighted MR imaging 412 h after MCA occlusion was significantly smaller in both YM872 treatment groups (99+/-52 mm3 and 102+/-44 mm3 compared to 186+/-72 mm3 in the control group, +/-S.D. and p=0.008). The infarct volume as assessed by T2 weighted MR imaging 24 h after MCA occlusion was significantly smaller only in the 24 h YM872 treatment group (262+/-57 mm3 compared to 366+/-49 mm3 in the control group, +/-S.D. and p=0.01) while the infarct volume in the 4 h YM872 treatment group (357+/-88 mm3) was similar to the control group. YM872 treatment significantly reduced the infarct volume 24 h after MCA occlusion when the drug was administered as continuous infusion during the 24-h observation period.
