A 2(8/12)-year old boy suffered from hemiplegia secondary to a post-varicella arteriopathy. His clinical status improved and after 4 years of follow-up he had no recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack. Regular improvement of arterial lesions, demonstated by serial transcranial Doppler investigations, excluded a progressive arteriopathy. Aspirin therapy was initiated and continued during 2,5 years. Transcranial Doppler is a portable, non-invasive tool that can be easily used on a regular basis to follow-up children with post-varicella arteriopathy.
