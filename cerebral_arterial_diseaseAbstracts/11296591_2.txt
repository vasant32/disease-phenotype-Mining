Although anterior circulation transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) tend to be more common in patients with extra- cranial carotid arterial disease than in those with intracranial carotid or middle cerebral arterial disease, the authors recently encountered 4 patients with both recurrent, stereotypical TIAs as well as isolated stenosis of their petrous internal carotid artery (ICA). While the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of intracranial large-artery disease has always been conventional angiography, magnetic resonance angiography changes, confirmed with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography in 2 of these patients, were quite sufficient to define the occlusive disease in each of the cases. Petrous ICA stenosis is not uncommon, but it has often been overshadowed by the search for extracranial ICA disease that might be amenable to surgical reconstruction.
