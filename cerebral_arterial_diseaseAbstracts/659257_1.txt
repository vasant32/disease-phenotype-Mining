The authors present a four-month-old boy with acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome who had hemiparesis of the left side of face and body, electrocardiographic findings suggesting myocardial infarction, angiographic evidence of obstruction of the right middle cerebral artery, and aneurysms of the coronary arteries and the brachial arteries. The authors suggest that the disease of this boy is a syndrome of systemic vasculitis.
