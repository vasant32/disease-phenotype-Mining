BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the optimal values of flow velocity on transcranial Doppler (TCD) in grading the severity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis in comparison with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). METHODS: Both TCD and MRA examinations were performed on 148 asymptomatic patients. The peak flow velocities of each MCA were recorded. Severity of MCA stenosis on MRA was classified as normal-mild (< 50% lumen diameter reduction), moderate (50%-75%), and severe-void (> 75% and void of flow signal). RESULTS: Among 296 MCAs evaluated, normal-mild stenosis was found in 75 (25%), moderate stenosis in 112 (38%), and severe stenosis in 109 (37%). The mean of systolic velocity (Vs) of MCA differed significantly among these three groups: mean Vs = 121.83 +/- 22.52 cm/s in the normal-mild group; 155.96 +/- 21.62 cm/s for the moderate group; and 199.39 +/- 43.86 cm/s for the severe group (P < .001). The optimal cutoff velocity for detection of MCA (> 50%) stenosis was found at Vs > 140 cm/s on TCD (area under the ROC curve is 0.87, P < 0.001). The best cutoff points for grading severity of on TCD were 140 cm/s and 180 cm/s. CONCLUSION: TCD enables grading of the severity of MCA stenosis according to the flow velocity. This method provides a noninvasive and reliable method for grading MCA stenosis and allows longitudinal monitoring of the relationship between clinical outcome and hemodynamic change.
