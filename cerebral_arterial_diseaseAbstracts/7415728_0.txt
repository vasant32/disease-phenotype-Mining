For specifying the pathogenesis of transient cerebrovascular disorders and the importance of occlusive lesions in the major cerebral vessels in this form of cerebrovascular pathology a new simple and safe method--ultrasonic dopplerography--was used in 87 patients. Subsequent cerebral angiography showed that the comparative reliability of this method in occlusions of the carotid and vertebral arteries reached 92.3%, and in their stenoses 76.6%. This makes it possible to recommend the ultrasonic dopplerography method for broad use in the conditions of both polyclinics and hospitals for examining patients with signs of transient cerebrovascular insufficiency.
