BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an arteriopathic syndrome related to a genetic defect on chromosome 19. Characteristic changes in CADASIL can be observed onT2-weighted MR images in the subcortical white matter. The purpose of this study was to measure changes of regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) with dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and to correlate the changes to disability and cognitive performance. METHODS: We obtained rCBV measurements of 24 individuals with proven CADASIL on a 1.5-T MR imaging unit. A susceptibility-weighted MR imaging sequence was used for bolus tracking. Principles of the indicator dilution theory were applied to estimate values of absolute rCBV (mL/100 g). Disability was determined by using the Rankin scale, and overall cognitive performance was assessed by using the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: The mean rCBV in the subcortical white matter that was hyperintense on the T2-weighted images (2.7 +/- 0.8 mL/100 g) was significantly lower than the rCBV in the white matter that appeared normal on the T2-weighted images (4.4 +/- 1.3 mL/100 g) (P <.05). The mean rCBV in the gray matter was within the normal range (8.3 +/- 1.7 mL/100 g). Both cognitive impairment and disability negatively correlated with rCBV in the subcortical white matter that was hyperintense (P <.05) but not with rCBV in the normal appearing white matter. rCBV did not correlate with age. CONCLUSION: rCBV measured in the hyperintense subcortical white matter in individuals with CADASIL was decreased and inversely correlated with disability and cognitive impairment.
