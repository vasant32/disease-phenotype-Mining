Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 3T offers increased signal to noise ratio with better background suppression, leading to exquisite depiction of the intracranial circulation. We present a pictorial review of the normal variations and anomalies of the intracranial circulation detected on MRA performed on a high field 3T clinical scanner using parallel imaging techniques. The salient imaging features of these anomalies and normal variations are discussed with relevance to clinical practice.
