Two patients had large (20--30 mm) suprasellar aneurysms with clinical findings resembling an expanding pituitary tumour. One aneurysm was giant (30 mm). Its delayed diagnosis for six years led to severe chiasmal compression. The other aneurysm was compressing the optic nerve. Visual improvement resulted after surgery.
