The clinical picture of different forms of diffuse periaxial encephalitis (DPE)--encephalic, pseudotumorous and psychic--is described. The authors present criteria of the diagnosis of each of these forms and their differentiation from other clinically similar diseases (viral encephalitides, brain tumours and psychoses). They also outline the signs distinguishing DPE from multiple sclerosis and to a certain degree from leukodystrophies.
