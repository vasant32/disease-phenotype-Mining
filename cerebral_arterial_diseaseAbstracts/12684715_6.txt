There are few reported cases of nontraumatic dissecting aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and their neuroradiological and clinical features have not been analysed. We looked at these aspects in a collaborative study. We reviewed 13 patients diagnosed as having a dissecting aneurysm of the MCA based on clinical signs and neuroradiological findings in 46 stroke centres between 1995 and 1999. There were four patients who presented with cerebral ischaemia, and nine who presented with bleeding. Of the former group, three were aged less than 15 years. Cerebral angiography showed extensive stenosis and a double lumen of the M1 portion in all four patients. High signal on T1-weighted images around the arterial flow void, due to intramural haematoma, was often seen in the second week. MR angiography showed findings corresponding those of intra-arterial angiography in all four cases. We saw an infarct on CT or MRI in territory of the perforating branches of the M1 segment in all four patients. In the patients presenting with bleeding, pure subarachnoid haemorrhage or a sylvian fissure haematoma was seen on initial CT, and the predominant angiographic finding was dilatation with stenosis, but the site of the lesions was not uniform. A double lumen or intimal flap was seen in about half the cases. Rebleeding occurred within 14 days of the onset in five of the nine patients, with a poor prognosis.
