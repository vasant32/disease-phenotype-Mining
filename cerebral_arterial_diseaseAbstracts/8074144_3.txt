We report on a patient with Williams syndrome who suffered a cerebrovascular accident. Clinical evaluation demonstrated the presence of carotid and cerebral arterial stenoses. We believe these lesions led to acute cerebrovascular ischemia and a non-hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. It is possible the stenoses were exacerbated by a vasculitis. The stenoses were identified by both invasive and noninvasive imaging studies. These studies may have a role in the evaluation of persons with Williams syndrome.
