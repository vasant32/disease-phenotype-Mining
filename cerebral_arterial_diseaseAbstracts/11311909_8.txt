BACKGROUND: Aneurysms arising from the proximal portion of the anterior cerebral artery (A1: horizontal portion) are quite rare and are considered to be unique, because they are usually connected with other vascular anomalies and are sometimes part of a multiple aneurysm occurrence. A1 aneurysm cases experienced over the past seven and a half years are summarized in this paper. METHODS: A total of 413 patients were surgically treated including 142 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); the remaining 271 patients had unruptured aneurysms. Among them, nine cases were categorized as constituent A1 aneurysms, three with SAH and six with unruptured aneurysms. RESULTS: The shape of the aneurysm was saccular in all nine cases. Three of the nine cases had associated vascular malformations. The average aneurysm diameter in the three cases with SAH was 4.0 mm, which is smaller than other common aneurysms presenting with SAH. Eight aneurysms developed at the takeoff point of perforating arteries-the medial lenticulostriate artery in five cases and the recurrent artery of Heubner in three cases. In the remaining case, the aneurysm originated from the proximal end of the associated A1 fenestration. All nine patients had an excellent outcome after surgery. CONCLUSION: A1 aneurysms require surgical elimination even if they are small. We emphasize the importance of preserving the blood flow of these perforating arteries by avoiding compression with either the clip blade or the clip body itself.
