The transcranial doppler (T.C.D.) is a non-invasive technique useful for the evaluation of vasospasm and intracranial hypertension in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (S.A.H.). Eighteen patients with recent S.A.H. were studied by means of T.C.D. device: in 14 patients the source of bleeding was a ruptured aneurysm of the circle of Willis, while the remaining 4 presented a negative four-vessels angiography. All the patients were studied 5 and 10 days after the bleeding. Our data showed that the ultrasonographic demonstration of vasospasm and/or I.C.H. is clearly related to the clinical status of the patients. No significant T.C.D. difference was noticed between the "sine materia" S.A.H. patients and the ones with ruptured aneurysm.
