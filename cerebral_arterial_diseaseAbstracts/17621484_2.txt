Genetic and acquired disorders that foster a procoagulable state represent risk factors for stroke in childhood. Although an increased incidence of thromboembolic complications has been reported in patients with thalassemia, severe cerebral thromboembolism has rarely been observed in patients with beta-thalassemia minor. This article describes a case study of a 1-year-old boy who presented with left-sided hemiparesis, seizures, microcytic anemia, and recent infection with reactive thrombocytosis. Ischemic infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. Genetic tests showed that the patient was heterozygous for the beta(degrees) -thalassemia IVS-I-1 mutation and homozygous for the methylentetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the synergistic effects of multiple, genetic, and acquired prothrombotic risk factors brought about the hypercoagulable state that resulted in overt stroke in a thalassemic patient in early childhood.
