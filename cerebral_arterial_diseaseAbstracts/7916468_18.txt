PURPOSE: To determine the magnitude and duration of peripheral vascular and cardiac Doppler signal enhancement after intravenous administration of contrast agent SH U 508A. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suboptimal cardiac or peripheral vascular Doppler examinations were evaluated. A total of 75 intravenous bolus injections were made in 30 patients. Spectral audio Doppler intensity was measured throughout the duration of contrast effect. RESULTS: No clinically relevant adverse effects were noted, and Doppler enhancement was apparent in all cases. The diagnostic confidence of the investigators when scored before and after Doppler enhancement improved from 35% to 91% (P < .05). Doppler intensity increased more than 16 dB in all vascular regions investigated (P < .05). The contrast effect lasted for more than 120 seconds in the peripheral vascular and cardiac groups at equivalent doses. CONCLUSION: Intravenously administered SH U 508A is effective in markedly increasing cardiac, femoral arterial, and transcranial (cerebral arterial) Doppler signal intensity. The effect improves the clinical diagnostic confidence in cases of suboptimal unenhanced Doppler examinations.
