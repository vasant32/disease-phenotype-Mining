The fusion imaging of the 3D MR cisternography (MRC) and 3D MR angiography (MRA) was applied for the assessment of the major cerebral arterial stenosis. The outer wall configurations of the stenotic lesions of the intracranial major cerebral arteries within a cisternal space were depicted by 3D MRC. Flow-related vascular structures were shown by 3D MRA. Fusion imaging was created by compositing volumetric data of MRC and co-registered MRA by using a workstation with transparent perspective volume-rendering technique. Stenotic lesions of the intracranial cerebral arteries were assessed as a discrepancy of 3D MRC and 3D MRA findings on a fusion image. Fusion imaging of 3D MRC/MRA could visualize stenotic lesions of the intracranial major cerebral arteries caused by atherosclerotic plaques; and this may provide useful information in the management of acute and chronic ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerosis of the intracranial major cerebral arteries.
