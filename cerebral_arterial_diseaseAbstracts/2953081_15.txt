Transcranial (TC) pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate flow velocity within the intracranial basal cerebral arteries in 71 patients with cerebrovascular disease as revealed by arteriography. Abnormalities of the fast-Fourier transformed (FFT) Doppler spectra were used to detect and classify obstructive lesions as well as dilative arteriopathy of the carotid siphon, the middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries, and the basilar artery. Functional stenosis due to large shunting volumes in patients with arteriovenous malformations and in the presence of significant collateralization of extracranial obstructive lesions were similarly diagnosed.
