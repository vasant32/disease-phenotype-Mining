Among 21 patients with angiographically demonstrated stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) 14 presented with a stroke and 7 with transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). Of the former 4 had further strokes (3 fatal); of the latter one had a fatal stroke. Only 2 of the 21 patients had TIAs during the follow-up period. The present study indicates that the prognosis for patients with MCA stenosis is less good than the literature suggests. There is appreciable risk of fatal stroke especially in those who present with a stroke. This perspective is important when deciding on the need for EC/IC bypass.
