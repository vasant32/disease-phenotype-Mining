Time-dependent changes in the lumped and rate constants in a bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in cats were evaluated. These variables were measured in 11 cats after a sham operation, in five after a 1-h occlusion, in two after a 2-h occlusion, in five after a 4-h occlusion, and in four after a 16-h occlusion. The time course of the cerebral tissue radioactivity [Ci* (t)] was monitored by external coincidence counting during a programmed infusion of [18F]2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Arterial plasma concentration [Cp* (t)] of tracer was kept constant during the first 45 min. Comparison of k2* and k3* in the sham-operated group, estimated by external coincidence counting, and by the ratio of extraction fractions of glucose and [18F]2-FDG, demonstrated no significant difference between these rate constants in these two groups of animals. The rate and lumped constants were also estimated from Ci* (t) and Cp* (t), as well as from the ratio of extraction fractions of glucose and [18F]2-FDG, respectively, in the MCA occlusion group. Significant decrease in k3* was observed after 1 h of occlusion (20% lower than in the sham operation, p less than 0.05); in k1* decrease occurred within 4 h of occlusion (21% lower than in the sham operation, p less than 0.05). However, decrease in k2* was observed only after 16 h of occlusion (26% lower than in the sham operation, p less than 0.05). Namely, decrease of rate constants occurred first in k3* then in k1* and k2*.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
