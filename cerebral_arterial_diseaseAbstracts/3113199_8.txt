Varicella zoster (VZ) is an unusual cause of CNS angiitis, usually occurring in older patients and immunocompromised hosts. The infection most commonly presents as herpes zoster ophthalmicus with contralateral hemiplegia. Mycotic aneurysm formation associated with VZ angiitis is rare. We report two cases of VZ angiitis with mycotic aneurysm formation (both aneurysms eventually ruptured) and one case of probable VZ angiitis with distal carotid occlusion and cerebral infarction. The CT and angiographic appearances, clinical course, and histopathology are presented.
