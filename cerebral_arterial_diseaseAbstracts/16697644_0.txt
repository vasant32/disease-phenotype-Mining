We describe a patient with a right anterior choroidal artery territory infarction and an inconspicuous left visual defect. The anterior choroidal artery is a unique artery of the cerebral circulation. The occlusion of this artery can result in dysfunction of motor, sensory, and visual systems with only rare involvement of higher cortical function. Among symptoms reported, visual abnormalities are the most variable and the least common. However, the visual field abnormality may be overlooked and the incidence underestimated since some patients may not be aware of the problem until uncovered by formal visual field testing.
