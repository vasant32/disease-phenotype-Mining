A feedback method for testing the reactivity of the occipital-parietal EEG in selected brain-lesioned patients revealed abnormalities of (a) insufficient reactivity, (b) bilateral differences in reactivity, and (3) asynchrony. These abnormalities were more evident during feedback stimulation than in the baseline conditions. The utility of feedback method for detecting EEG abnormalities rests on the increased stability or decreased "noisy" variation in the EEG during feedback. The EEG becomes more predictable even to the "on-line" human observer. This makes it easier to detect aberrations or deviations from normal effects. Some effects can only be seen with feedback such as the bilateral differences which occur when the left side controls the feedback compared to when the right side controls it. The results show that feedback EEG is a useful tool in clinical research and indicate that a clinical diagnostic test could be developed with more research. However, the feedback EEG method is not yet a proven diagnostic technique.
