A case of cerebral vasculitis in a previously healthy 22-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse is described. Cerebral angiograms showed evidence of vasculitis. A search for possible causes other than cocaine produced no results. We now include cocaine with methamphetamines, heroin, and ephedrine as illicit drugs that can cause cerebral vasculitis.
