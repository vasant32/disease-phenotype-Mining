Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has similar efficacy to unfractionated heparin with less hemorrhagic complications. We studied the neuroprotective effect of LMWH on a rat model of focal-ischemia. Our results revealed that treatment with LMWH at 1 and 3 h following thrombotic MCA occlusion reduced brain edema and infarct size and improved clinical outcome. Treatment with LMWH initiated at 6 h after thrombin injection only partially ameliorated brain damage.
