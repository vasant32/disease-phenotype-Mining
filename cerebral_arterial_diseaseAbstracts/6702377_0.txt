Using REG data, the effect of decimeter electromagnetic wave therapy (DEMWT) on the cerebral hemodynamics was studied in patients in the early recovery period following reconstructive surgery on the cerebral vessels. The results of the study suggest that the use of DEMWT increases considerably the compensatory-adaptive functions of the body and improves significantly the cerebral hemodynamics which is paralleled by the regression of neurologic symptomatology. DEMWT represents a physiological and pathologically-substantiated method for treating the given category of patients.
