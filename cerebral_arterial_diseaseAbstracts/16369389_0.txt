BACKGROUND: Vascular thrombosis is a rare but well-recognized extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis. Thrombosis usually involves the peripheral veins and less commonly the cerebral veins and the arterial system. CASE REPORT: A case of a 22-year-old woman is reported who presented with an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis and developed extensive arterial and venous thrombosis. Good clinical improvement was achieved after treatment with steroids, sulfasalazine, and anticoagulation with enoxaparin followed by long-term warfarin. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of thrombotic complications is essential in initiating lifesaving therapy.
