In 1 case of occlusion of the basilar artery and 1 case of occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery a CT Scan performed within 24 hours of onset showed a high density area corresponding to the segmental arterial occlusion. In both cases on repeat CT Scans 5 and 9 days after the onset the high density area had disappeared.
