Flexible thin fiber catheter is applied as vascular endoscope for occlusive lesions in the extracranial cerebral arteries. This fiber catheter is introduced transfemorally through 6 or 7 french-sized double lumen balloon catheters. Vascular endoscope clearly demonstrates the internal surface of these vessels by transient occlusion of the proximal side of the vessel through balloon inflation. The occlusive lesions in the subclavian artery or in the proximal vertebral artery were revealed as round smooth-surfaced mass to be treated by the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
