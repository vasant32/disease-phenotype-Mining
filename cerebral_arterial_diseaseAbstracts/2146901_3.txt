Ischemic stroke is a common and disabling complication of sickle cell disease (Hb SS). Most infarctions occur in the presence of intracranial stenotic lesions of the large vessels of the circle of Willis. Transcranial Doppler (TCD), by measuring flow velocity in these arterial segments, can detect focal stenosis on the basis of elevated flow velocity. We report the preliminary results of a prospective study to develop criteria for detection of stenotic lesions based on TCD and identification of patients with Hb SS at risk for stroke. Comparing the TCD findings from six patients with lesions demonstrated by angiography to those from 115 Hb SS children without stroke, we conclude: (a) middle cerebral (MCA), anterior cerebral (ACA), or internal carotid (ICA) artery mean velocities greater than 190 cm/s strongly suggest focal stenosis; (b) MCA or ACA mean velocities of 150 to 190 cm/s suggest abnormality but at present cannot be considered diagnostic of stenosis; (c) mean velocities up to 150 cm/s are possibly due to the effects of low hematocrit and/or young age, and cannot as yet be distinguished from velocity elevations due to vessel stenosis.
