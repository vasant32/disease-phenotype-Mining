The authors show that aneurysmic diverticula of cerebral vascular walls cam grow in size and to develop, with time, into true saccular aneurysms. Cases of aneurysmic diverticula transformation into aneurysms illustrate dynamic pattern of aneurysmogenesis and formation of this pathology during life. Feasibility of the growth and rupture of the aneurysm in intracranial hemorrhage dictates necessity of follow-up visualizations of cerebral vessels in such patients (contrast angiography, NMR angiography).
