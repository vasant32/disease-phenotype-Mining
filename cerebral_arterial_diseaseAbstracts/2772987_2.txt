We report a case of essential thrombocythemia, the only clinical manifestation of which consisted of neurologic symptoms, including anomic aphasia, tactile and painful hypesthesia in the right hand, headache, and Gerstmann syndrome, with a relatively benign and slowly progressive clinical course. Neuroradiologic examination disclosed a large ischemic area in the left temporoparietal region. Cerebral angiography revealed an occlusion of the cortical branches of the left middle cerebral artery with total sparing of the carotid vessel. These findings are discussed in relation to the possible pathogenetic mechanisms of the vascular occlusion due to abnormal platelet function in essential thrombocythemia.
