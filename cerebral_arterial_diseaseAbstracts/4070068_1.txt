In monkeys (Rhesus and Cynomolgus) and in rabbits on atherogenic diets, the experimental atherosclerotic involvement of cerebral arteries is strongly delayed. When extracranial arteries appear already heavily involved, no or minimal involvement of intracranial arteries is found even at scanning and/or transmission EM examination. The Concanavalin A reactivity, which is positive at the endothelial cell surface in other arterial districts, is lacking in the cerebral arteries of monkeys and rabbits. The possible significance of these findings is evaluated.
