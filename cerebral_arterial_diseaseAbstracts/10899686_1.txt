Patients with coronary disease complicated by severe carotid or intracranial arterial stenosis underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) using a novel method of dynamic pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (Super Pulse CPB). The Super Pulse technique can maintain the systolic pressure and systolic-diastolic amplitude in such a way that they mimic the physiologic circulation. Forty-five patients (33 males and 12 females, mean age 65.1 years) with coronary disease who had a greater than 75% stenosis of the carotid or intracranial arteries were evaluated. Evaluation was performed for the following 3 groups: 8 patients with conventional pulsatile CPB (Group I), 8 patients with conventional pulsatile CPB plus intraaortic balloon pumping (Group II), and 29 patients with Super Pulse CPB. Maximum, minimum, and mean perfusion pressures during CPB were 112.7, 53.6, and 76.9 mmHg (integrated mean), respectively, in Group III. The systolic-diastolic amplitude was significantly better than for Group I and similar to baseline pressures. No patients in Group II or Group III developed perioperative cerebral disorders or myocardial infarction, while in Group I perioperative cerebral disorders developed in 3 patients, myocardial infarction occurred in 2 patients, and 2 patients died during hospitalization. The initial performance of the Super Pulse CPB indicates excellent safety, and is useful for patients with co-morbid cerebral arterial disease.
