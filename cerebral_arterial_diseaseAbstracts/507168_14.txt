An 18-year-old man developed acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and homonymous hemianopia. Cerebral angiography showed cerebral vasculitis probably with occipital infarction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case with such concomitant visual defects. Other published reports suggest that such cerebral vasculitis may not be unusual in acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy.
