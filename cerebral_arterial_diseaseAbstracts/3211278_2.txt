Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an important cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic cerebrovascular disease in some normotensive elderly patients. The diagnosis is made by proof of amyloid deposition in the vessel wall. A case of recurrent and multiple intracerebral hemorrhages due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy after head injury is reported. A 74-year-old female was referred to our hospital because of head injury. CT scan showed traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hematoma. Her consciousness was clear but slight disorientation was recognized. Conservative therapy was performed. During the course subcortical hemorrhages occurred five times and during the second one, right frontal and right parietal hemorrhages occurred simultaneously. Her consciousness deteriorated. The second subcortical hemorrhage was especially complicated by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation. A biopsy of the cortex was performed and pathological examination revealed amyloid deposition in the walls of small pial and cortical vessels. Occasional duplicated wall, obliterative intimal proliferation and disappearance of elastic lamina were recognized. The patient sank into a vegetative state due to recurrent and multiple hemorrhages. CAA results in two possibilities, hemorrhage and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. When lobar or subcortical hemorrhage is encountered in a normotensive elderly patient, the possibility of a CAA-related hemorrhage should be considered. The author carefully emphasizes that there is indication for neurosurgical treatment in CAA patients and proposes that therapy for ischemic cerebrovascular disease should be given special attention.
