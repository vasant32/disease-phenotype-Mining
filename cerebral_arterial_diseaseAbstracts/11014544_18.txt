OBJECT: The authors tested the hypothesis that oxygen metabolism is the key factor linking the long-term viability of ischemic brain tissue to the magnitude of residual blood flow during the first 6 hours following a stroke. METHODS: Eleven anesthetized pigs underwent a series of positron emission tomography studies to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism before and for 7 hours after the animals were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. The extent of collateral blood supply was assessed using angiography. Abnormal metabolism of the ischemic tissue progressed as a function of time in inverse proportion to the magnitude of residual CBF, and the volume of the infarct grew in inverse proportion to the residual blood supply. Ten hours after occlusion of the MCA, the infarct topographically matched the tissue with a cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption below 50% of values measured on the contralateral side. This was also the threshold for the decline of the oxygen extraction fraction below normal, which was critical for the prediction of nonviable ischemic tissue. Mildly ischemic tissue (CBF > 30 ml/100 g/min) did not reach the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen threshold of viability during the first 6 hours after MCA occlusion; moderately ischemic tissue (CBF 12-30 m1/100 g/ min) reached the threshold of viability in 3 hours; and severely ischemic tissue (CBF < 12 ml/100 g/min) remained viable for less than 1 hour. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the residual CBF and both oxygen metabolism and extraction is critical to the evolution of metabolic deficiency and lesion size after stroke.
