OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and feasibility of Biodiv Ysio stent for patients with symptomatic M1 stenosis of middle cerebral artery (MCA). METHODS: Forty-three patients with forty-five M1 stenoses, ranged from 50% to 99% in diameter reduction and refractory to medical therapy, were enrolled in this study between March 2002 and November 2003. The lesions were situated at M1 trunk (n = 19), M1 origin (n = 12) and M1 bifurcation (n = 14), respectively. RESULTS: The technical successful rate was 97.8% (44/45) for all the lesions. The rate of complicating subarachnoid hemorrhage was 7.0% (3/43 patients) and the rate of death was 2.3%. During a follow-up of 7.0 months (median), there was no recurrence of transient ischemic attack or stroke in 41 available patients. Six-month angiographic follow-up was obtained in 6 patients (7 vessels), demonstrating good patency in 6 stenting vessels and restenosis in one vessel. CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty associated with Biodiv Ysio stent appears to be a safe and feasible for the patients with symptomatic M1 stenosis of MCA, under strict control of periperformeral project. Further study is, however needed.
