The acute occlusion of cerebral artery by embolism causes severe cerebral infarction. In cases with poor colateral circulation, cerebral infarction develops more severely. In these cases, quick recanalization of the occluded cerebral artery is necessary to prevent severe hemorrhagic infarction and brain edema. We report a case where interventional techniques were used to bring about quick recanalization of occluded cerebral artery. We encountered a case of a sixty-year-old male who experienced complete occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery due to an embolus. It was very hard to pass a guide wire through the embolic lesion. At first, we tried mild local fibrinolysis therapy using tissue plasminogen activator, but we could not get any recanalization. However, after mild local fibrinolysis therapy, the guide wire could be passed through the occlusion point. Secondly, we tried percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with 2.0mm diameter angioplastic balloon using up to five atomic pressures, after which we obtained partial recanalization. Finally we achieved total recanalization of the middle cerebral artery by PTA with a 2.5mm diameter angioplastic balloon. We crushed this embolus using the angioplastic balloon with up to six atomic pressures. The point of the techniques is to press the embolus against the arterial wall. After this angioplasty, there was an occlusion of the common trunk of the posterior parietal artery and the angular artery. However there was neither massive hemorrhagic infarction nor massive brain edema on follow up CT. In the treatment of acute occlusion of the cerebral artery due to embolism, we found PTA is very effective against the embolus. In the future, we need to develop a retrieving device and a balloon that will prevent the production of small emboli during the crush process involved when bringing about recanalization using PTA.
