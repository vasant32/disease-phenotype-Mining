Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an arterial lesion of unknown origin which may sometimes affect intracranial arteries. In recent years a few rare cases, mostly involving younger people, have been described. The present case concerns a child of 8 years in whom the finding of hemiplegia led to a diagnosis of intracranial fibrodysplasia which was proven by arteriography and biopsy. This arterial lesion is described within the context of stroke in children.
