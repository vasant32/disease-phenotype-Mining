We report a 44-year-old woman with atypical aortic coarctation accompanied by cerebral artery disease. She was hospitalized for vertigo. An extra-anatomic bypass between the ascending aorta and abdominal aorta was performed using partial cardiopulmonary bypass under moderate hypothermia to reduce the after load of the left ventricle and maintain cerebral blood flow and cerebral perfusion pressure. The postoperative course was uneventful and there was no postoperative neurological deficiency.
