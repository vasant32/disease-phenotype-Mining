Ten histologic sections were sampled from similar cortical regions in each of 84 autopsy brains removed from patients aged 60 to 97 years. The sections were stained by the Congo-red method and examined under polarized light for the presence of cortical (parenchymal) cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Some degree of CAA was found in 36% of all brains examined, with a higher proportion of patients affected in each successive decade of life. Angiopathy was seen most frequently and was of greater severity in the parietal and occipital gray matter. Overall, it was often a patchy and asymmetric lesion. There was sparing of subcortical white matter and the hippocampi. CAA was most severe in cases of Alzheimer's disease, but occurred in the absence of this condition.
