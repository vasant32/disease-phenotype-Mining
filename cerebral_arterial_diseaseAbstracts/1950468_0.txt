Dynamic CT was conducted on 10 patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion or stenosis and 14 controls. All the patients were chronic phase and they only presented small infarctions on CT. Those with ICA or MCA occlusions and insufficient collateral circulations showed delayed mean transit time and peak time of the affected side on functional image and in parameter analysis (P less than 0.01) compared with those of controls. A statistically significant positive coefficient of correlation was noted between the degree of the anterior horn dilatation of lateral ventricle and delay in mean transit time of the affected MCA area (r = 0.62, P less than 0.01).
