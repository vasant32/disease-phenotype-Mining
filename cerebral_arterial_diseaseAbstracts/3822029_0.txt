Reports vary with respect to frequency of multiple aneurysm but they are observed in an average of 13% of intracranial aneurysm cases. Multiple aneurysms generally involve several intracranial vascular trunks but those affecting the vertebrobasilar system and middle cerebral artery are the most common combinations. It is rare for more than two lesions to be located on the trunk of a same vessel. These data emphasize the exceptional nature of the clinical case presented. The eight aneurysms detected in this patient were all situated on the left sylvian artery and its proximal collaterals. Rupture of one of the aneurysms had provoked haemorrhage into sylvian fissure. All eight aneurysms were treated by eleven clamps during the course of a one-stage operation. Full recovery, with completely normal clinical and review arteriographic results, was obtained despite the postoperative onset of a right hemiplegia with aphasia.
