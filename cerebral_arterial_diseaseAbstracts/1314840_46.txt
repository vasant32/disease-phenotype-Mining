Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a transient depression of neuronal activity that spreads across the cortical surface. In the present studies, we have investigated CSD activity in the penumbral zone following permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in the rat (n = 16/group), using double-barreled Ca(2+)-sensitive microelectrodes. Measurements of CSD activity were made for 3 h in each animal. During this time, a varying number of spontaneous CSDs were seen in the control group (total was 30, with a range of 0-7/rat). These CSDs were of varying duration: "small" (approximately 1 min) and "big" (5-45 min) CSDs. During a CSD, the extracellular [Ca2+] decreased to 0.11 +/- 0.07 mM (mean +/- SD). After 3 h, the extracellular [Ca2+] in the cortex (penumbral zone) was either normal (10/16 rats) or lowered to 0.5 mM (2/16 rats) or to 0.1 mM (4/16 rats). In the caudate nucleus (ischaemic core area), all rats had an extracellular [Ca2+] of approximately 0.1 mM when measured after the 3 h recording period. Neuropathological evaluation of the brains of the animals, which had been allowed to survive for 24 h after MCA occlusion, revealed ischaemic damage in the dorsolateral cortex and caudate nucleus. Administration of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, MK-801 (3 mg/kg i.p.), 30 min after MCA occlusion resulted in 24 and 29% reductions in the volume of hemispheric and cortical damage, respectively, which was highly significant (p less than 0.0001); no protection was seen against caudate damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
