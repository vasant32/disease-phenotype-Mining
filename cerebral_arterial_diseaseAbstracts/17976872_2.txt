INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is a common condition with a prevalence of about 1%. Clinical extradigestive presentations are various and stroke can be one of the neurological manifestations. EXEGESIS: Two cases of stroke occurring in young adults are described, leading to the diagnosis of celiac disease. Hyperhomocysteinemia or cerebral arterial vasculopathy in one case and antiphospholipid syndrome in the other case are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of stroke during celiac disease. CONCLUSION: The possible presence of celiac disease should be discussed in unexplained young adult stroke.
