We report a case of postpartum cerebral angiopathy with headache; a rare entity that affects women within the early postpartum period. Cerebral angiography revealed multiple segmental narrowings of major cerebral arteries. The patient was monitored with transcranial color-coded sonography of the middle cerebral artery. Abnormally increased flow velocity within the middle cerebral artery decreased following initiation of steroid therapy, and the patient's headache improved dramatically.
