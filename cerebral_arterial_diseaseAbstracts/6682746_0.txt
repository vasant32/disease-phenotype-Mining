Two cases of acute hemiplegia with the occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery were reported in children. Both patients were low-birth-weight infants with a history of febrile convulsions. Cerebral edema due to prolonged seizures was considered to be an etiologic factor of the occlusion of posterior cerebral artery. When the seizure is focal or the patient has perinatal difficulty, febrile convulsions should be treated carefully, as the possibility of epilepsy exists.
