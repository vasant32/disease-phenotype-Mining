The problem of brain ischemia damage treatment stimulates the search for new effective methods, which are studied on various experimental models. Most of such models possess significant disadvantages, producing hypoxia in the whole organism, being poorly controlled, involving serious traumas, and still being far from true pathological mechanisms accompanying the ischemia development. A model of focal brain ischemia in rats, induced by middle cerebral artery intravasal occlusion, is free of these disadvantages.
