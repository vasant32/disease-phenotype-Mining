OBJECTIVE: To study correlations between total lesion load on brain MRI and clinical features, and to evaluate the influence of demographic variables on quantitative MRI variables in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). BACKGROUND: CADASIL is a hereditary form of small-vessel disease caused by mutations within the Notch3 gene. MRI abnormalities have been found both in asymptomatic and symptomatic CADASIL individuals. METHODS: Quantitative measurements on cerebral MRI were performed in 64 CADASIL individuals. MRI lesions were quantified using a semi-automated segmentation technique based on local thresholds. RESULTS: MRI total lesion volume correlated significantly with disability (Rankin Scale) on both T1- and proton density (PD)-weighted images. There was a significant inverse correlation between total lesion volume and overall cognitive performance as determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Age but not sex was correlated with lesion load both on T1- and PD-weighted images. There was no detectable influence of the Notch3 genotype on quantitative MRI variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates correlations between MRI lesion volume and clinical characteristics in CADASIL. Longitudinal studies are now warranted to investigate whether quantitative MRI could be used as an adjunct outcome measure in future therapeutic trials in CADASIL.
