Fibromuscular dysplasia of the arteries (FMD) is a segmental angiopathy which may produce obstruction of the carotid, cerebral, renal, mesenteric, coronary or iliac arteries. Except for lesions related to arterial hypertension, retinal manifestations have not yet been reported. This paper describes the case of a 10-year-old boy with progressive deafness, a history of an unexplained stroke and progressive occlusions of the retinal arterioles in the fundus periphery. This resulted in retinal neovascularization and recurrent retinal and vitreous hemorrhages. Despite repeated photo- and cryocoagulation the eyes progressed to a tractional retinal detachment which was successfully treated by vitrectomy and scleral buckling. The diagnosis of FMD was made on the basis of a histopathological examination of a temporal artery biopsy. The child also presented an asymptomatic but severe aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta and CT scan and MRI showed dilated cerebral arteries. The father of our patient had died at the age of 27 years either from myocardial infarction or rupture of a dissecting aortic aneurysm. He was highly myopic and had lost one eye from retinal detachment. The younger brother of our patient also presents aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta and tortuous cerebral vessels. Ocular examination is still normal. The findings in this family are compatible with an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression.
