Our purpose was to evaluate a dedicated head and neck coil for demonstration of supra-aortic arteries with optimised magnetic resonance angiography techniques. We performed 47 examinations with a 1.5-T system. We used coronal 3D fast imaging with steady precession (FISP), axial 3D tilted optimised nonsaturating excitation (TONE) and 2D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) for the carotid bifurcation, axial 3D TONE with or without magnetisation transfer (MT) for intracranial arteries, and axial 3D FISP or TONE for the aortic arch. Evaluation included visual assessment of image quality and grading of stenoses near the carotid bifurcation; digital subtraction angiography was used as the reference method. Axial 3D TONE gave superior image quality at the carotid bifurcation, MT-TONE intracranially, and 3D FISP for the aortic arch vessels. Nevertheless, sensitivity and specificity for detection of significant stenoses were similar with coronal 3D FISP (96.3%, 94.0%), axial 3D TONE (92.6%, 92.5%) and axial 2D FLASH (96.3%, 86.6%). Image quality at the aortic arch needs further improvement.
