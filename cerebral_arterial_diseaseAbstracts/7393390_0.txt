The authors present the results of surgical treatment of 48 aneurysms situated on the anterior communicating artery operated upon by the classic and microsurgical methods. The latter method has made it possible to raise the proportion of very good and good results from 23% in the classic method to 70%, and to reduce the postoperative mortality in groups I and II of condition severity from 13.6% to 4%. Independently of the method used Korsakoff's syndrome was observed in 17% of cases. The high value of Yasargil's surgical approach is stressed.
