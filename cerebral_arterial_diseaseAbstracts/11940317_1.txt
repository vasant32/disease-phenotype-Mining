OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of transcranial Doppler (TCD) in the detection of cerebral hemodynamic changes in diabetic macroangiopathy and microangiopathy. METHODS: 81 of diabetic patients and 62 age-, gender- matched healthy controls were monitored with TCD in this study. The pulsatility index (PI) and mean flow velocities (Vm) between the patients and healthy controls, between the patients with microangiopathic complications and patients without complication, were analyzed respectively. RESULTS: The PIs of arteries and Vms of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) and basilar artery (BA) were significantly higher in diabetic patients than those in healthy controls (P < 0.001), while PIs of ICA and MCA but not BA were significantly increased in patients with complications than those in noncomplicated patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: It indicated that PI and Vm might be two useful markers for the detection of diabetic cerebrovascular changes. Marked increase of PIs of ICA and MCA might reflect the microangiopathic changes of cerebral vessels in diabetic patients.
