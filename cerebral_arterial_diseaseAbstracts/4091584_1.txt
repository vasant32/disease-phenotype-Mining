Neurological symptoms in hypertensive subjects may be a reflection of intracranial vascular disease and not just a consequence of hypertension. Two hypertensive children with renovascular disease, neurological symptoms, and severe cerebral arterial disease were treated by extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass surgery with improvement of symptoms and easier control of blood pressure. Where revascularisation surgery is appropriate, this should be undertaken before neurological complications arise.
