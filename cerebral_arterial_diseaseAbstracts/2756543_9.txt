Three patients with cysticercosis developed a cerebral infarct secondary to the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or its major branches. Histopathologic examination revealed a large subarachnoid cysticercus surrounding the occluded arteries in two patients and diffuse thickening of the leptomeninges in one. Blood vessels around the parasite showed inflammatory changes that caused either occlusive endarteritis or thrombosis due to disruption of the endothelium. Cysticercosis should be considered as a cause of occlusion of the major intracranial vessels, particularly in young patients living in areas where this disease is endemic.
