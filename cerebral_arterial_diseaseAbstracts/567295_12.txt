Basilar artery migraine is distinctive disorder characterized by symptoms referable to dysfunction of brainstem structures in conjunction with more typical migrainous phenomena. Our experience with 12 cases, seen in a period of 10 years, is reviewed. In one instance, an attack of basilar artery migraine was captured by EEG, and appeared as a typical photoconvulsive response. More than half of our patients responded well to anticonvulsant drugs.
