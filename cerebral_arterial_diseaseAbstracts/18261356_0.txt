OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of middle cerebral artery stenosis (MCAS) in a dynamic manner so as to supply evidence to help prevent cerebral stroke based on the results of epidemiological study. METHODS: 2500 residents were sampled randomly from the residents of Rongqi town and underwent questionnaire survey, physical examination, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), and detection of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) in 2002, and 1068 of them that conformed with the criteria: (1) without symptoms of brain ischemia, (2) with temporal window to conduct TCD, and (3) having undergone the questionnaire survey and blood biochemical examination, were enrolled for lone-term study. In 2006 844 of the 1068 residents remained, 277 males and 567 females, aged 60 +/- 10 (12.5 - 88) who still conformed to the criteria. Based on the results of TCD examination of MCA the residents were divided into two groups, MCAS group and non-MCAS group. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The morbidity of MCAS of the asymptomatic residents was 2.73% in 2002 and 4.62% in 2006. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that history of diabetes mellitus (GM) and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) were the risk factors of MCAS based on the data of 2002. But, 4 years later, history of hypertensive disease, coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus and HHcy were the risk factors and marriage status was also a factor. The changes of coronary heart disease, DM and BMI were the risk factors of MCAS. CONCLUSION: MCAS exists in the asymptomatic residents. History of hypertensive disease, DM, CHD and HHcy are the risk factors of MCAS Heart attack and changes of body weight contributed to MCAS.
