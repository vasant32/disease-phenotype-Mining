The authors present a group of 38 patients with middle cerebral artery aneurysms in whom 48 aneurysms were excluded from the cerebral circulation by microsurgical techniques. In 11 cases multiple aneurysms were found. In 2 cases the wall of the aneurysm was strengthened. In the light of this material and a survey of the pertinent literature the authors analyse the relationship between the results of surgical treatment and various factors. A significant increase in postoperative mortality was found with more severe condition of the patients by the Botterell scale. The factors worsening the prognosis were also: presence of intracerebral haematoma and aneurysm location in the bifurcation of an artery. Arteriospasm increased the incidence of neurological deficits.
