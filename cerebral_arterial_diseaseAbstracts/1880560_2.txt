Fifty-one patients with intracerebral stenosing arteriopathy were studied by computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral arteriography. Clinical symptoms were varied, included impaired cognitive functions, progressive neurological deficit, headache and vomiting, and were sometimes not suggestives of the diagnosis. CT scans of the brain were normal in 25 percent of the cases or they were not probative because of various and non-specific abnormalities (hypodensity of various types or haemorrhagic hyperdensity). MRI always showed abnormalities but in many cases the lesions observed on T2-weighted images consisted of non-specific focal areas of high-intensity signal in the white matter. High-intensity signals in both white matter and cortex seemed to be more suggestive of the diagnosis. In this as in other studies, arteriography therefore remains the reference examination for stenosing arteriopathies. Inflammatory, infectious and atheromatous processes are the main causes of these arterial lesions. The aetiological value of radiological examinations is poor, and in most cases the morphology and distribution of the lesions does not point to any specific origin. However, herpes zoster arteritis usually affects the proximal segments of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries and spares the carotid siphon.
