A retrospective study of 45 patients with low-tension glaucoma revealed the mean age at diagnosis to be 66 years. Seventeen patients had follow-up visual field examinations, the average follow-up period being 6.4 years. There was no significant difference in prognosis of the ocular course between patients with Po/C equal to or greater than 100 and those with Po/C less than 100. The presence of splinter hemorrhages at the optic disk (10% of affected eyes) or of systemic arterial hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg) was associated with progression of visual field defects. Patients with sudden visual loss or associated hemodynamic events (33% of the total patients) had a more favorable prognosis regarding stability (lack of progression) of visual field defects than those without such an event. Extension of visual field defects across the macula was a common finding (25% of affected eyes). No firm evidence was obtained to indicate that treatment of the low-tension glaucoma improved the prognosis of the ocular course.
