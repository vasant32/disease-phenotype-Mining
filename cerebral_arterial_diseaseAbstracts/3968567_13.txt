Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP's) reflect the integrity of the central neuronal pathway, and as such may be used to assess function that remains during a variety of cerebral insults. To evaluate the natural history and utility of SEP's during experimental cerebral ischemia and infarction, SEP's were measured in 17 adult cats at 24 hours and 1 hour prior to right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, and again immediately afterward and at either 6 hours (five cats) or 24 hours (six cats) post-occlusion. Before occlusion of the right MCA, the SEP's were identical in the right and left hemispheres. After occlusion, there was a significant slowing of the interpeak latency of the first positive peak (P1) in the right hemisphere (3.53 +/- 0.6 msec before compared to 3.99 +/- 0.6 msec after occlusion, p less than 0.001). Maximal slowing in right hemisphere P1 latency was seen in those animals in which the stroke extended into the thalamus (4.38 +/- 0.1 msec). This was significantly slower than left hemisphere values (3.92 +/- 0.32 msec, p less than 0.01). The ipsilateral cortical components of the SEP's, the second positive peak (P2), and the major negative deflection (MN) were slowed in all cats immediately after right MCA occlusion compared to preocclusion measurements (p less than 0.001). Severe infarcts in the mid-suprasylvian and posterior ectosylvian gyri (including the somatosensory cortex) resulted in a greater slowing of the latency of MN compared to less severe infarcts in that region (20.6 +/- 3.9 msec versus 16.4 +/- 1.1 msec, p less than 0.05). There was a precipitous decrease in the amplitude or voltage of the ipsilateral P2-MN complex immediately after occlusion (5.32 +/- 0.4 microV before compared to 0.98 +/- 0.3 microV after occlusion, p less than 0.001). Therefore, the central latencies and cortical amplitudes of the SEP's are sensitive experimental tools as indicators of the onset and extent of a cerebral ischemic insult.
