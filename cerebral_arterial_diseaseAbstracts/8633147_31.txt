PURPOSE: To evaluate angiographic and clinical results in patients with a dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) who underwent percutaneous transvenous embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart analysis and radiologic studies were performed in 24 patients (aged 20-87 years) with a dural AVF treated with percutaneous transvenous embolization. Lesions were located in the transverse and/or sigmoid or superior sagittal sinus. Clinical follow-up was 3-44 (mean, 10.8) months. RESULTS: After percutaneous transvenous embolization of 24 dural AVFs, there was complete occlusion in 17 patients, important flow reduction in three, and moderate flow reduction in four. Twenty patients were clinically cured, 17 with complete occlusion and three with important flow reduction. In patients with moderate flow reduction, clinical improvement was good in two and moderate in one. One patient remained clinically unchanged. A transient complication was seen in one patient, and a permanent complication was seen in one patient. One patient, whose preexisting clinical status was poor, died. During long-term follow-up, the condition of two patients worsened. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous transvenous embolization appears to be effective in the treatment of dural AVFs. More experience is needed to evaluate long-term results.
