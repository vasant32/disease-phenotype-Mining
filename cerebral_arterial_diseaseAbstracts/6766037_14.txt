Two patients who developed large intracranial vessel occlusion after standard radiation therapy for brain tumor are described. This form of vascular occlusion is usually seen in patients who have previously been treated by radiotherapy for intracranial tumor who then develop a relatively acute change in neurologic status. Histology of the lesion mimics accelerated focal arteriosclerosis. The clinical and radiographic manifestations of one case were highly atypical. The vasculopathy became evident shortly after termination of radiation therapy for a fourth ventricular ependymoma, and the angiographic picture stimulated a diffuse arteritis. The second patient was more typical, with clinical symptoms developing 12 years after radiation therapy for an oligodendroglioma. Occlusion of a proximal vessel that had been included in the radiation port was demonstrated radiographically and confirmed by pathologic examination. The clinical, angiographic, and histologic features of these two cases are discussed and previously reported cases are reviewed.
