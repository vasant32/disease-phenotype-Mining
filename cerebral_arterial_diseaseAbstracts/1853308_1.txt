Chronological changes in plasma or serum concentrations of various fibrinolytic parameters, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 and FDP, were examined in 31 healthy volunteers before and after venous occlusion to determine a suitable time of venous stasis and a good parameter for use in a simplified venous occlusion test. After venous stasis for 5 min, a significant increase in the serum concentration of FDP (from 38.3 +/- 21.1 to 100.9 +/- 87.2 ng/ml (n = 24)) was observed, and the increase was parallel with changes in the plasma concentrations of other fibrinolytic parameters. The serum FDP level after 10 min VO was not significantly higher than that after 5 min VO. A significant decrease in ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed after venous occlusion when measured by the impedance method, but not by the turbidimetric method. Therefore, as a simplified test, the change in the serum concentration of FDP after VO for 5 min was measured. The clinical significance of this simplified test was evaluated in fourteen patients with stenosis of cerebral artery. The mean percentage change in serum FDP concentration after venous stasis in the patients, 34.5 +/- 54.8%, was significantly less than that in normal subjects, 156.5 +/- 90.9%. Similar results were obtained on changes in plasma responses of other fibrinolytic parameters. Measurement of increase in serum FDP concentration after venous occlusion for 5 min should be useful as a screening tests for the hypofibrinolytic or thrombotic state due to vascular dysfunction.
