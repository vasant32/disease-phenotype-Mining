The purpose of this study was to explore whether patients with left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) lesions have defective mental visual imagery and to differentiate whether such a deficit stems from a loss of knowledge about the visual appearance of objects or from an inability to create mental visual images out of preserved visual knowledge. Normal controls and patients with either left or right PCA lesions were asked to verify low- and high-imagery sentences and then to verify pictorial representations of the predicates of high-imagery sentences. High-imagery questions concerned either the shape or the color of objects. In addition, perceptual discrimination of shape and color was assessed. Patients with right PCA lesions were impaired on the perceptual discrimination tasks. Left PCA patients did not significantly differ from controls on low-imagery sentences but scored significantly lower on shape and color questions. Their impairment was distinctly more severe with the pictorial than with the verbal versions of shape and color questions. In comparison to patients with occipital left PCA lesions, patients with temporo-occipital left PCA lesions were selectively impaired on verbal and visual color questions. It is concluded that patients with left PCA lesions lack knowledge about shape and color of objects, but that their ability to convert visual knowledge into mental images is preserved.
