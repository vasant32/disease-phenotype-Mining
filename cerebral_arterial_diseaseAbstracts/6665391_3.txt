A patient with no previous relevant history presented with recurrent cerebral hemorrhages of which he died 4 years 5 months after the onset. On autopsy, an amyloid angiopathy was present and localised to the cerebrovascular system. Hemorrhages were associated with some small infarcts in the subcortical regions. The leptomeninges and the cortical arteries were mostly involved by an infiltration mainly in the adventitia and media. There were no senile plaques in the cortex. The amyloid deposit present in the senile plaques and in the vessel walls of the amyloid angiopathy could be the result of two distinct pathological processes.
