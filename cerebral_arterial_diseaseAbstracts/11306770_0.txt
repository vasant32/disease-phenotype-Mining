Subgroup analyses of data from an open-label study of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) administered to stroke patients were performed. Clinical outcome and incidence of intracranial hemorrhage were evaluated in 20 patients diagnosed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound as having proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Additionally early infarct signs and size of final infarction were assessed. A favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) was seen in 30% of all patients. The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hematoma (10%) in patients with proximal MCA occlusion was higher than the overall hemorrhage rate of intravenous rt-PA treatment, but comparable to the data on intra-arterial thrombolysis in this stroke subgroup. All patients except 1 developed ischemic infarction in the MCA territory. Intravenous rt-PA treatment within 3 h may also be effective in patients with proximal MCA occlusion. The risk of intracerebral hematoma does not seem to be greater than in intra-arterial thrombolysis.
