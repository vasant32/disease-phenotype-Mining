Nine patients who have died of giant cell arteritis (GCA) are described. Two patients died of myocardial infarction caused by GCA in the coronary arteries. Another two patients died of dissecting aneurysm of the aorta where GCA were found in the lesions of the aorta wall. Giant cell arteritis causing cerebral stroke was the cause of death in five patients. None of the cases were receiving adequate corticosteroid treatment when symptoms of the ischemic catastrophies started. These cases illustrate that GCA is a generalized arteritis that can involve arteries of vital importance.
