Resting- and acetazolamide (Acz)-activated-regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements were performed by consecutive single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies before and after Acz administration using equal-volume-split technetium-99m-L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer. Quantitative rCBF images were converted from qualitative axial SPECT images by the application of Patlak plot graphical analysis with radionuclide angiography and Lassen's linearization correction. Total time span required for this study was 53 minutes. The unaffected side of 37 studies with unilateral vascular lesions and 45 studies without apparent vascular lesions showed 132 +/- 17% and 140 +/- 15% increase of mean CBF (mCBF), respectively, under Acz administration. Comparing these values, the Acz-activated rCBF increases of less-affected and affected hemispheres of 23 studies with bilateral vascular lesions (116 +/- 13% and 113 +/- 12%, respectively) was lower with high statistical significance (P < 0.001). For the other 20 cases, physiologic saline was administered instead of Acz. This group showed no changes in mCBF under placebo administration (after placebo/baseline; 100 +/- 6%). Acetazolamide-activated rCBF increase was recognized clearly and easily using quantitative images. This noninvasive method is easy to perform and may be helpful to detect regional abnormalities of hemodynamic reserve in cerebrovascular diseases.
