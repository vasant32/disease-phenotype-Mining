BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine the usefulness of transcranial color-coded real-time sonography (TCCS) in detecting stenosis in the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). METHODS: Using TCCS and the incident angle correction technique, we measured the peak-systolic flow velocity in bilateral MCAs in 45 consecutive patients in whom cerebral angiography was carried out within 1 week before or after TCCS. Three patients had a stenosis of 75% or greater and four had a unilateral occlusion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) (the ICS and ICO groups, respectively). Eight patients had a stenosis of 50% or greater (one bilateral and seven unilateral) (the M1S group). Four patients had unilateral distal occlusion of the horizontal portion of the MCA (the M1O group). Twenty-six patients had no significant extra- or intracranial stenosis on the ipsilateral or contralateral side (the control group). RESULTS: Mean peak-systolic flow velocity on the affected side was 83.0 +/- 20.8 cm/s in the ICS group, 59.8 +/- 23.2 cm/s in the ICO group, and 62.3 +/- 33.7 cm/s in the M1O group. In the control group, the mean peak-systolic flow velocity was 116.0 +/- 31.5 cm/s. In the M1S group, however, the mean peak-systolic flow velocity (334.2 +/- 35.7 cm/s) on the affected side always exceeded 180 cm/s (mean value +/- 2 SD in the control group), and was significantly higher than that in the other groups. The mean peak-systolic flow velocity in the M1S group increased with the grade of stenosis. CONCLUSION: The M1S group members could easily be distinguished from the other group members by their peak-systolic flow velocity in excess of 180 cm/s. Measurement of the peak-systolic flow velocity of the MCA by TCCS may help to identify a significant stenosis in the horizontal portion of the MCA.
