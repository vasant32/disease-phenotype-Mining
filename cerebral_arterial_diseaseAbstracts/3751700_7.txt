Patients with multiple intracranial aneurysms present a great challenge to neurosurgical practice. The presence of one or more additional aneurysms, whether recognized or unrecognized, along with the source of the haemorrhage profoundly changes the outcome. It also alters the timing and strategy of surgery. In this study the experiences gained from 138 cases with a total of 317 aneurysms are discussed. The analysis of the clinical data, our results and the factors influencing the outcome suggest that the risk of clipping all aneurysms simultaneously are less than the risk of a rebleed from an untreated, previously silent sac even in the early postoperative period.
