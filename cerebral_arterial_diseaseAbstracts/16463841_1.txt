Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be complicated by reduction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) from large conductance vessels leading to focal edema appearing as an area of hypoattenuation on CT. In this study we included 29 patients with SAH due to aneurysmal rupture, having 36 CT low density areas within the middle cerebral artery territory in whom a total of 56 Xenon-CT (Xe-CT) studies were performed. Collectively, we evaluated 70 hypoattenuated areas. rCBF levels were measured in two different regions of interest drawn manually on the CT scan, one in the low density area and the other in a corresponding contralateral area of normal-appearing brain tissue. In the low density area (22.6 +/- 22.7 ml/100 gr/min) rCBF levels were significantly lower than in the contralateral area (32.8 +/- 17.1 7 ml/100 gr/min) (p = 0.0007). In the injured areas deep ischemia (CBF < 6 ml/ 100 g/min) was present in only 25.7% of Xe-CT studies, suggesting that hypodense areas are not always ischemic, whereas in 43.7% of the lesions/Xe-CT studies we found hyperemic values. Patients with a better outcome had hyperemic lesions, suggesting brain tissue recovery in injured areas.
