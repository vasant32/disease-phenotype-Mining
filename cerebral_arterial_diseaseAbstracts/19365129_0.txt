BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification is known to be associated with cardiovascular mortality, and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity is associated with major cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the correlation between arterial stiffness and cerebral arterial calcification. METHODS: Arterial stiffness, as measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and cerebral arterial calcification, as measured by CT angiography using a 40-multidetector scanner, were examined in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Sixty-seven subjects who were free of renal disease or peripheral arterial disease were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that baPWV was significantly correlated with cerebral arterial calcification (r = 0.524, p < 0.001) and age (r = 0.452, p < 0.001), and multiple linear regression analysis indicated that age and cerebral arterial calcification were independent determinants of baPWV. CONCLUSION: We report that increased baPWV is closely associated with the degree of cerebral arterial calcification in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Our results suggest that the severity of cerebral arterial calcification is representative of the degree of systemic arterial stiffness.
