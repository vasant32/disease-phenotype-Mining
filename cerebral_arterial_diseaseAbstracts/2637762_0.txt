Three cases of anterior choroid artery are reported, representing 0.80% of all strokes admitted to our Service in the last 3 years. Their clinical features were manifold and only motor involvement was common to the 3 patients, although with varying intensity and topography. In one case there was pure motor hemiparesis. Only one patient had sensory impairment, whereas none had defects in the fields of vision. In the 3 patients, CT showed the characteristic hypodense image limited to the posterior limb of the internal capsule, whereas EEG was normal in the 3 patients. The clinical outcome was very satisfactory in one patient and fair in the other two, with persisting sequelae which did not prevent an autonomous lifestyle.
