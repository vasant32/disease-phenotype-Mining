Cerebral ptosis (CP) consists of acute and bilateral drooping eyelids due to a right or left middle cerebral artery territory stroke, without involvement of brain stem, third cranial nerve or oculosympathetic fibres. The pathogenesis of CP is still unknown, but most authors have hypothesised that eyelid control is hemispherically lateralised. Two new cases of CP and a complete literature review are reported in this paper. Because no unanimous criteria for CP diagnosis are currently available, a proposal for new criteria is also included.
