Intravenous angiography is a a safe, rapid, simple examination, which, with sonography, is complementary in selecting patients for conventional angiography. This examination is not designed to replace conventional angiography, but, rather, to study high-risk stroke patients, patients with asymptomatic cervical bruit, or postoperative patients. Improvements in contrast media, film subtraction, the use of oral anesthesia with viscous lidocaine, and the technique of cooling the contrast medium have made the procedure more successful. A review of 1,000 examinations was undertaken to determine the accuracy of the technique and to emphasize technical points. Excellent results, comparable to conventional angiography, were obtained in 50.3% patients and good results in 32%. Poor or uninterpretable results were obtained in 17.7%. These were secondary to either patient movement or the presence of venous reflux or statis of contrast medium.
