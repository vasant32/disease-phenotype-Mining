A 45-year-old woman presented with subacute encephalopathy due to autoimmune Graves disease. MR angiography (MRA) demonstrated stenosis of the major intracerebral arteries. After high-dose methylprednisolone therapy and plasmapheresis, her neurologic status improved dramatically, and the MRA findings resolved after 3 months. The angiographic findings in Graves disease that resemble those in Moyamoya disease are temporary.
