PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of three-dimensional, Fourier transform, time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in the detection of intracranial steno-occlusive diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-one patients (62 male and 69 female patients, aged 6-77 years [mean, 53 years 8 months]) underwent MR and conventional angiography for evaluation of possible intracranial vascular disease. A total of 502 arteries were assessed. Eight projections and a collapsed image postprocessed by means of a maximum-intensity projection algorithm were reviewed by five observers in a blinded manner, with conventional angiography as the standard. RESULTS: A total of 32 steno-occlusive lesions were available for review. Receiver operating characteristic analysis from the pooled data revealed overall sensitivities of 85% and 88% and specificities of 96% and 97% for the internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery, respectively. CONCLUSION: MR angiography is useful as the primary diagnostic tool for evaluating suspected intracranial steno-occlusive disease.
