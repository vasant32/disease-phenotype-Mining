Electroencephalographic-clinical investigations were carried out in 94 patients with ischaemic syndromes of the cerebral hemispheres divided into two groups: with occlusion or stenosis of arteries in the neck (37 patients) and with lesions of intracranial arteries (57 patients). In all cases EEG was done and the diagnosis was verified on the basis of cerebral arteriography. The types of signs in EEG and the correlations between them and the clinical manifestations and their intensity were analysed. These data were related to the results of angiography. No significant differences were observed between the patterns of EEG changes with regard to the location, extent and morphology between the group with lesions of neck arteries and the group with lesions of intracranial arteries.
