BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: At neuropathological examination, the territory of the anterior choroidal artery is frequently found to be involved in massive infarcts of the internal carotid artery territory. The aim of our study was to analyze the clinical spectrum, the course, and the mechanism of these massive infarcts compared with the rare infarcts involving only the anterior choroidal artery territory. METHODS: Retrospective clinical examination and pathological study were performed in 35 patients with cerebral infarcts affecting at least the territory of the anterior choroidal artery. RESULTS: In no patient had the involvement of the anterior choroidal territory infarcts been recognized clinically, nor had the triad of clinical signs (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and hemianopsia) classically seen in infarcts restricted to this territory been found alone. Impairment of consciousness, cognitive disorders, or oculomotor palsies had been found in addition to one or more signs of the triad. This was probably related to the involvement of other territories (94%), especially the middle cerebral artery territory (68%) and the posterior cerebral artery territory (20%). The concomitant involvement of several territories was due most frequently to an occlusion of the internal carotid artery, which was found at autopsy in 74% of the patients. These occlusions were often associated with cardioembolism (54%). In contrast, artery-to-artery embolism (17%) and small-artery disease (6%) were seldom found. Only two cases of infarcts restricted to the anterior choroidal artery territory were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of the territory of the anterior choroidal artery in massive infarcts was due mainly to a cardioembolic occlusion of the internal carotid artery.
