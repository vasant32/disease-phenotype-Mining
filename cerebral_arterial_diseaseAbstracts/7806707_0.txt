The frequency of occurrence and the characteristics of vascular mineralization in the brains of cows were studied. Mineralized lesions were found in the pallidal arteries in eight of 13 cows. They appeared as basophilic deposits in the arterial walls, were sheath-like or tubular in shape, and were accompanied by intimal oedema or fibrous thickening. The deposits were positive for periodic acid-Schiff, von Kossa's, alizarin red and Berlin blue stains. Elemental analysis revealed the presence of large amounts of phosphorus, calcium and zinc, as well as small amounts of iron, copper and sodium.
