OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of the three-dimensional (3D) CT module of the flat-panel digital subtraction angiography (DSA) system. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among 278 patients receiving examination with rotational 3D-CT of INNOVA 3100 flat-panel DSA system. AW4.3-04 workstation was used to perform the 3D reconstruction and INNOVA CT reconstruction, and the imaging data were analyzed in comparison with the clinical results. RESULTS: The 3D-CT of the flat panel DSA system displayed the conditions of cerebral aneurysms in 54 cases, cerebral arteriovenous malformation in 25 cases, and the intracranial conditions in 24 cases. The blood supply and tumor vessels were clearly displayed in 57 cases, and the effects of embolization and endovascular stenting were evaluated in 27 and 21 cases, respectively. The rotational 3D-CT was used to evaluate complete embolization in 24 cases, and failed to display the feeding arteries of small tumors in 11 cases. The vascular lesions, biliary tract lesions, and the occurrence of hemorrhage during interventional therapy were observed in 58, 5 and 25 cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 3D-CT module of the flat-panel DSA system can easily display abnormal vascular lesions and provide comprehensive anatomical information to facilitate interventional therapies and complication monitoring.
