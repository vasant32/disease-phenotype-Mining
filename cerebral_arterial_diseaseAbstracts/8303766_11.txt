BACKGROUND: Food ingestion sometimes induces systemic hypotension (postprandial hypotension). Although the possibility of stroke occurring postprandially has been suggested, no cases have been reported until now. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old man experienced repeated transient ischemic attacks after almost every ingestion of food and showed orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. An angiogram revealed occlusion of his left carotid artery and stenosis of his right middle cerebral artery. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial as well as orthostatic hypotension can be a risk factor for stroke in patients with severe occlusive cerebrovascular disease.
