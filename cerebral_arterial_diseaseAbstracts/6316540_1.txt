Gamma scintigraphy plays an important role in the topographic diagnosis of focalized cerebrovascular insufficiency. Furthermore, sequential imaging allows a comparative study of arterial distribution while studying the "transit time" of the radioactive tracer. In this work, the authors attempted to quantify transit time in patients with chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency while comparing the radioactivity in the hemispheres with that of the various arterial territories. The study of the arca and slope of the various arterial territories. The study of the area and slope of the tracer profile indirectly gives information about the cerebro-correlation between cerebrovascular resistance and the clinical state, there was, however, an interesting relation during vasodilator treatment (ifenprodil tartrate) in which promising clinical results were preceded by an increase in the arterial inflow component of the radioactivity curve.
