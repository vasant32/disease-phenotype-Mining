A rare syndrome is described. Combined investigation, including CT, yielded in a patient a typical clinical picture of nonatherosclerotic brain vessel calcification, especially within basal ganglia, parkinsonism, psychoemotional disorders, motor paroxysms. The syndrome etiology is discussed. Hypoparathyroidism with blood Ca metabolism and hereditary causes seem plausible. Differential diagnosis and treatment are described.
