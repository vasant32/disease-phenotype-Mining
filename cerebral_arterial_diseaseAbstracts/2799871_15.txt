We used the Fink-Heimer method to study degenerating corticofugal axons after unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion in 14 adult male Long-Evans hooded rats. Axonal degeneration in the pyramidal tracts was prominent at 1-3 weeks, manifesting in well-defined silver-impregnated axonal bundles coursing from the internal capsule to the pyramids and crossing completely to the contralateral spinal cord. In half of eight rats examined at 1-3 weeks, the cortical infarct included the forelimb region of the sensorimotor cortex, and degenerating corticospinal axons could be traced to the lower cervical segments; in rats with involvement of the hindlimb cortical area as well, axonal degeneration extended to the lumbosacral segments. Terminal degeneration products were present in the forebrain, midbrain, and brainstem within 2 days after arterial occlusion; the number of degenerating terminals peaked at 7 days and decreased gradually thereafter up to 6 weeks. Dense terminal degeneration was observed in the trigeminal nuclear complex of all seven rats studied at 2 and 7 days. In these seven rats, five had small cortical infarcts, and silver-impregnated terminals were observed in the lateral reticular formation; in two rats with large cortical lesions, terminal degeneration was prominent in the medial reticular formation as well. We conclude that infarcts produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion cause axonal degeneration in the brainstem and spinal cord. The Fink-Heimer method may be useful for evaluating the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model.
