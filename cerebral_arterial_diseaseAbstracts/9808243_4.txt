Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a condition caused by mutations of Notch3 gene on chromosome 19. Ultrastructural analysis of skin vessels discloses typical granular osmiophilic material (GOM) within the vascular smooth muscle basal lamina. We describe a CADASIL family in which two members suffering from a vascular leukoencephalopathy were shown to be CADASIL phenocopies: clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in these two patients were similar to those observed in their affected relatives. However, the skin biopsy performed on one of them did not reveal any GOM in the vascular smooth muscle cells, and the Notch3 mutation present in this family was shown to be absent in these two individuals. We emphasize the role of a direct DNA test for gene mutation to make a differential diagnosis between CADASIL and other forms of vascular leukoencephalopathy.
