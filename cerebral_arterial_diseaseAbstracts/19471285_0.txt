There is notable variation in incidence, presentation, risk factors, and prognosis for strokes occurring in children.

The study by the international Pediatric Stroke Study investigators on predictors of cerebral arteriopathy in children with arterial ischemic stroke deserves special attention in planning secondary stroke prevention strategies in this population of patients.
