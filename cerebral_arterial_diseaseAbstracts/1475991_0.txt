Pentoxifylline was first registered (in Germany) 20 years ago. Then its main action seemed to be vasodilatation. Later hemorheological effect, in particular on red cell deformability, were found. Independent of its pharmacological effects, the clinical effectiveness in peripheral and cerebral arterial disease is well established. More recently its action on leucocytes has gained interest. Both rheological and biochemical changes have been reported. This new knowledge will create new indications for pentoxifylline within the near future which possibly will go beyond angiology.
