The pathogenic link between sleep-disordered breathing and early neurological deterioration in acute ischaemic stroke patients is now a subject of clinical investigations. Vasomotor reactivity and intracranial blood flow steal in response to changing vasodilatory stimuli like carbon dioxide play a pivotal role in clinical deterioration with reversed Robin Hood syndrome. A mechanical ventilatory correction in selected acute stroke patients might have a beneficial effect on sleep-disordered breathing and brain perfusion. This is a novel therapeutic target and the missing link in the pathogenesis of early neurological deterioration and stroke recurrence.
