The effect of indomethacin on rCBF was studied in cats anesthetized with Nembutal either under resting conditions or with temporary middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. RCBF was measured by the microsphere method. In control animals (n = 3), indomethacin (4 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced rCBF by about 25% in both cortex (from 44 +/- 6 to 32 +/- 3 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.001) and white matter (from 36 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.001). After MCA occlusion rCBF was markedly decreased in the sylvian region ipsilateral to occlusion (ischemic core) (from 38 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min in cortex, 4 animals). Although pretreatment with indomethacin (4 mg/kg) (4 animals) 30 min prior to occlusion did not alter rCBF during ischemia, a marked enhancement of reactive hyperemia was observed in the ischemic core immediately upon reperfusion following 2 h occlusion (54 +/- 11 untreated vs 95 +/- 13 treated, p less than 0.05). In the delayed postischemic period, namely 2 h after recirculation, rCBF still remained to be higher in the animals treated with indomethacin (40 +/- 6 untreated vs 96 +/- 9 treated, p less than 0.001). Such an effect of indomethacin for ameliorating postischemic blood flow in both the immediate and delayed period was less prominent in the adjacent area (penumbra) ipsilateral to occlusion. In the contralateral hemisphere, indomethacin caused slight reduction in rCBF during ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
