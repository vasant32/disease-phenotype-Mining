Cerebrovascular pathology is one of the chief causes of death. Effects were studied of the drug preparation "Tanakan" on the process of the rehabilitation of those patients (n = 150) operated on for abnormalities and deformity of brain major arteries. Two groups were identified: pathologies of the vertebral arteries (n = 50), carotid abnormalities (n = 51), control groups (n = 24 and 25 respectively). The drug was administered in a dose of 40 mg on a three-times daily schedule. Clinical approaches were used as were the dopplerographic, electroencephalographic, biochemical, micromorphological, neuropsychological methods of investigation. Determined in the study was a positive dynamics of clinical indices, which was more apparent for vertebrobasilar discirculations. EEG-investigation revealed differences in the course of changes in left- and right-hemispheric location of carotidogenous discirculations. Increase in blood serum antioxidant activity was recorded as was a positive transformation of vegetative indices and improvement of cognitive functions. Thus, the use of the above drug is indicated in the postoperative complex of rehabilitative measures in patients with cerebrovascular ischemia secondary to developmental anomalies and deformities of brain major arteries.
