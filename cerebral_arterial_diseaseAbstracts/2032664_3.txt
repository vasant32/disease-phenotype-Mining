A 19-year-old male received kicks to his head in the course of a fight with other young people. On admission to hospital he became drowsy and developed a hemiparesis and a facial paralysis on the right. After 3-4 days of continuous improvement the patient suddenly fell unconscious again and died on the seventh day after the trauma due to an increase of the intracranial pressure. Neuropathologic examination revealed an extensive dissection of the wall of the left anterior and middle cerebral artery. The age of the recurring infarction in the dependent areas of blood supply corresponded to the biphasic clinical course.
