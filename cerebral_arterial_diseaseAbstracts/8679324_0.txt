A 47-year-old woman had an episode of severe headache for a few days. She suddenly experienced right leg weakness and sensory loss. A CT scan revealed subcortical hematoma at the left parietal lobe on admission. Cerebral angiography showed multiple vascular irregularities such as segmentally narrow or sausage-like dialatated areas. Her laboratory studies were entirely normal including antinuclear antibody and coagulation tests. The diagnosis of isolated angiitis of the CNS was made and she responded well to the low dose corticosteroid therapy. Repeated cerebral angiography two months after the onset demonstrated most of the areas of segmental irregularity had improved with a few unchanged areas. Some cerebral angiitis do exist that respond well to corticosteroid therapy, therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are suggested in cases of angiitis.
