OBJECTIVE: to investigate the influence of acupuncture parameter on acupuncture effect and to probe the optimum stimulation parameter for Shuigou (GV 26) in Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method. METHODS: The rat model of middle cerebral artery obstruction (MCAO) was replicated and "Shuigou" (GV 26) was stimulated by 9 acupuncture parameters combined by two factors at 3 levels, i. e. frequency 1, 2, 3 times/second, and needling duration 5 s, 60 s, 180 s. The effects of acupuncture at "Shuigou" (GV 26) with the 9 different acupuncture parameters on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the MCAO rat were investigated by orthogonal test, factor analysis and one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Acupuncture effect was influenced by acupuncture frequency, acupuncture duration and their combination. Among them, the acupuncture duration was the most important factor. The best acupuncture effect could be attained by using as long acupuncture duration as possibly with the fastest acupuncture frequency. CONCLUSION: In the Xingnao Kaiqiao needling method, acupuncture at "Shuigou" (GV 26) with fastest frequency and enough long duration can get the best acupuncture effect, which are the optimum stimulation parameters for "Shuigou" (GV 26).
