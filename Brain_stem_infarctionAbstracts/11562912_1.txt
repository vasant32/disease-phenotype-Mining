The aim of the study was to investigate the relation of the blink reflex R1 arc to known anatomical brainstem structures. Acute vascular brainstem lesions as identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with isolated R1 pathology were superimposed into a stereotactic anatomical atlas using a new method of digital postprocessing. Isolated acute brainstem lesions were documented by diffusion-weighted MRI in 12 of 24 patients with unilateral R1 pathology. The lesions were located in the ipsilateral mid- to lower pons. In three patients only, the lesion had partial contact with the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (PSN) on at least one level. In two patients, the lesion involved the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Most lesions were located medially and ventrally to the PSN on transverse slices. Our results underline the high localizing value of changes in the R1 component of the blink reflex in patients with ipsilateral pontine functional deficits. Although available physiological evidence suggests that the R1 component of the blink reflex traverses an oligosynaptic pathway, this MRI study does not support the view that synaptic transmission in the PSN subserves R1. The reflex arc probably descends more medially and ventrally on its course to the facial nucleus.
