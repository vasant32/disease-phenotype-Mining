A 36-year-old man was admitted to Kanto Chuo Hospital because of hearing loss and dysphagia. On admission physical and neurological findings revealed obesity, hypertension, nystagmus, right hearing loss, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Routine laboratory findings disclosed leukocytosis, liver dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia, proteinuria, and glucosuria. Immunological, coagulopathic, and endocrinological findings, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and brain CT scan were unremarkable. He was diagnosed as brainstem infarction, and then conservative therapies were begun. Seven hours after admission, he suddenly fell into coma and apneutic state, requiring artificial ventilation. The next day he was fully conscious, but could'nt make any voluntary movements except for vertical eye movements, suggesting locked-in syndrome (LIS). Brain MRI showed infarction of pons, medulla oblongata, and right cerebellum. Cerebral angiography revealed hypoplasia of bilateral vertebral arteries, a persistence of right primitive trigeminal artery (PTA), and retrograde blood flow of basilar artery from the PTA. Then he made a rapid recovery, and on 80th day he was discharged only with right hearing disturbance and mild left cerebellar sign. We speculated that hypoplasia of the bilateral vertebral arteries caused the brain infarction, and that back flow of the basilar artery from the PTA, in part, contributed to the early recovery from the LIS.
