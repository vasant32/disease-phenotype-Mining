We describe the orthodontic treatment of a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) who received orthodontic treatment that included rapid palatal expansion and orthognathic surgery. There is no report in the literature with this orthodontic treatment protocol, that was considered successful. The pros and cons of this approach as well as the risks involved are discussed.
