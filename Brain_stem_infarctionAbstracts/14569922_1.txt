Duplications of the oesophagus are rare congenital abnormalities and rarely communicate with the oesophageal lumen. They are commonly associated with other congenital malformations, such as spinal deformities, congenital heart disease, vertebral anomalies, malrotation of the bowel, Meckel's diverticulum. During a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, performed because of a neurological dysphagia, the endoscopy revealed a very rare case of a 26-year old man affected by Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, with an asymptomatic oesophageal duplication that communicated proximally and distally.
