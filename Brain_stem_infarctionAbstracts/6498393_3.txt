A 10-year-old boy presented with long-standing urethral bleeding from a cavernous haemangioma of the penis associated with Klipper-Weber syndrome. Bleeding was controlled by limited local excision and the urethra was successfully reconstructed with a full-thickness skin graft applied directly on to this cavernous haemangioma. From time to time split-skin grafts have been used to repair the defects following excision of simple haemangiomata but we could find no case report in the literature of a free skin graft applied directly on to a cavernous haemangioma.
