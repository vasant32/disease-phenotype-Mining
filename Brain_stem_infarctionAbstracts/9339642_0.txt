We report here on a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome who was later diagnosed with Huntington's disease. Consistent with the later diagnosis, a (CAG)n repeat longer than the normal range was observed on chromosome 4p. The presence of these two diseases in the same individual may represent coincidence or a true correlation which must be confirmed by other evidence. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of the concurrent presence of these diseases in the same individual.
