Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare, congenital, vascular disorder affecting one or more limbs. Originally, it was defined as a triad including port wine stain, varicose veins and bony and soft tissue hypertrophy. We present a case of a 20-year-old female who walked with a limp. Because of swelling of right leg she was sent for Doppler study which picked up dilated arteries and increased blood flow velocity. The impression of KTS was further strengthened by unique nuclear medicine and radiological findings.
