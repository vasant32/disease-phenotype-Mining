We report a symptomatic newborn with Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome, multiple and diffuse pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, and right-to-left shunting in the left lung. Right-to-left shunting was significantly decreased by selectively banding the left pulmonary branch artery and clipping one large feeding vessel so that total resection of the left lung could be avoided.
