The effects of the anticonvulsant gabapentin were measured on vision and eve movements in three patients with acquired pendular nystagmus. In two patients, the nystagmus was associated with multiple sclerosis and, in the other, it followed brainstem stroke. A single oral 600 mg dose of gabapentin produced improvement of vision due to changes in ocular oscillations in all three patients. The effect was sustained after five weeks of treatment in two patients who elected to continue taking gabapentin 900-1500 mg/day. The results of this pilot study suggest that a controlled trial of gabapentin should be conducted to evaluate its role in the treatment of acquired forms of nystagmus.
