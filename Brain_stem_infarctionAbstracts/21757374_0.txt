 BACKGROUND: The goal of the study was to clarify the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and brainstem infarctions (BSIs) and to investigate the clinicotopographic characteristics of BSIs in patients with diabetes. METHODS: Data were retrospectively reviewed for 1026 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital because of acute cerebral infarctions from January 2004 to August 2010. Acute symptomatic BSIs were explored on radiologic images and classified into multiple infarctions with BSIs, multifocal BSIs, and monofocal BSIs. Isolated BSIs were further classified based on the vertical distribution into midbrain, pontine, and medullary infarctions, and on the horizontal distribution into anterior-dominant, posterior-dominant, and anterior/posterior BSIs. Neurologic symptoms of BSIs and clinical background were compared between DM and non-DM patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of BSIs was 2.6-fold higher (P < .0001) in DM patients. Logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac diseases, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and DM showed that DM was independently associated with BSIs (odds ratio [OR] 2.814; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.936-4.090; P < .0001). Compared with non-DM patients, DM patients showed more frequent monofocal BSIs (P < .0001) and multifocal BSIs (P = .0296). Monofocal BSIs (n = 114) more frequently involved the pons (P < .0001) and medulla (P = .0212). Anterior-dominant BSIs (P < .0001) were more common in DM patients than in non-DM patients. Symptoms of BSIs included more frequent motor paresis (P = .0180) and less frequent diplopia (P = .0298) in DM patients than in non-DM patients. CONCLUSIONS: DM is important in the development of BSIs, and the associated clinical characteristics include more frequent motor paresis and less frequent diplopia.
