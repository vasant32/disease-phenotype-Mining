Palatal myoclonus associated with extremity movements such as myoclonus or tremor is uncommon and reports are rare. Five patients with palatal myoclonus and a rest tremor are presented. In four patients, a slow rest tremor (3 Hz or less) was present. The tremor persisted on sustained posture and finger-to-nose maneuvers and was usually not synchronous with the palatal movements. It was not associated with clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease and occurred in conjunction with brain-stem infarction in three patients.
