Transcatheter closure of large secundum atrial septal defects is now accepted clinical practice. With the introduction of easily applicable closure devices the indications for this procedure have been expanded to include the closure of patent foramen ovale after cerebral stroke of unknown origin. In some of these patients a persistent eustachian valve is present. The clinical relevance of this finding is still unclear. A 36 year old patient with a brainstem stroke of unknown origin and a secundum atrial septal defect in combination with a persisting prominent eustachian valve is reported. The potential role of the eustachian valve in the genesis of the stroke and the difficulties during transcatheter closure of the defect because of the persisting valve are discussed.
