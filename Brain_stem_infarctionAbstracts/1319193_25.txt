An extensive search for a genetic pattern in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) revealed two other cases of KTS in the families of two of the 86 patients with this vascular syndrome who were questioned. Patients with KTS also had family members with other malformations: e.g. hemihypertrophy in one family, and a prevalence of 7/400 of naevi flammei in first-degree relatives of KTS patients was observed. We suggest that KTS can be inherited in a multifactorial way and a range of vascular malformations can be observed in the family members of patients with this syndrome.
