A one-year-old child had hypertrophy of the left leg and an unusual constellation of a naevus flammeus and superficial enlarged veins of the trunk together with successive appearance and involution since birth of numerous nodular elements located in the naevus and in the surrounding normal skin. Microscopic examination of these elements showed haemangiomas with capillaries, cavernous channels and lymphangiomatous components. The benign nature of transient nodular elements located to the trunk and the lack of associated visceral vascular malformations in the Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome are documented.
