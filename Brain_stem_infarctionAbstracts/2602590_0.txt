Angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is considered probably the most common cause of the occult bleeding. This paper analyses retrospectively 8 patients with angiodysplasia from upper GI tract. Two of them had Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome. The main symptom was upper GI bleeding and 5 patients had acute melena and 3 chronic-intermittent bleeding. The diagnosis of angiodysplasia was confirmed by endoscopy. All patients but one underwent endoscopic treatment by injections of sclerosant and vasoconstrictor agents. One patient had hemigastrectomy and died in the post-operative. In the follow-up of 10 to 41 months, 2 patients died, one with bronchial carcinoma and the other due to cardiopulmonary failure. There was no bleeding recurrence in 5 patients. The endoscopic therapy should be the first choice if it is feasible, considering its efficacy as well as the low cost and safety.
