Two patients with epilepsy and large hemispheric lesions underwent section of the frontal fibres of the corpus callosum for the treatment of seizures refractory to medical treatment. A severely retarded girl of 18 had encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis (Sturge-Weber syndrome) with multiple daily absences, tonic-clonic, myoclonic, atonic and adversive seizures since infancy. All types of fits--with the exception of adversive seizures and rare tonic-clonic fits--disappeared after anterior callosotomy. Another moderately retarded girl of 18 had an old cystic lesion over the entire territory of the left middle cerebral artery. She had had right hemiplegia since infancy and frequent brief absences and massive myoclonus triggered by unexpected sensory stimuli since the age of six years. Following anterior callosotomy there was an almost complete disappearance of the absences and a marked reduction of her startle myoclonus. Frontal callosotomy is a useful procedure in epileptics with large hemispheric lesions and carries less risk than hemispherectomy or total commissurotomy.
