Various surgical techniques have been reported for vascular reconstruction in cases of vertebro-basilar occlusive disease, but sufficient study has not been made on the question of which technique should be applied in various pathological conditions. Based on our experience, we have examined the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques. In 34 patients with clinically and angiographically diagnosed vertebro-basilar insufficiency, the reconstructive vascular surgery to the posterior circulation was performed. Preoperatively, 24 had vertebro-basilar TIAs, 2 had RIND, 3 had progressing symptoms and 5 had brain stem infarctions verified by persistent deficits. In the 18 patients with intracranial vertebro-basilar occlusive lesions, the bypass were done to the proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery in 7 cases, proximal superior cerebellar artery in 9 cases, posterior cerebral artery in one and anterior inferior cerebellar artery in one. In the 16 patients with extracranial occlusive lesions of vertebral artery, endarterectomy or subclavian-vertebral transposition was performed. With the exception of one of the progressing stroke cases, in which the surgery was ultimately too late, there were no cases in which neurological symptoms become aggravated following operation. Patency was 94% (32/34). In light of these findings, the following conclusions concerning the operative indication and the selection of the technique have been drawn. In cases with occlusive lesions of basilar artery, the first choice should be bypass to the proximal superior cerebellar artery. In cases with occlusive lesions of vertebral artery, bypass to the posterior inferior cerebellar or superior cerebellar or anterior inferior cerebellar artery should be performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
