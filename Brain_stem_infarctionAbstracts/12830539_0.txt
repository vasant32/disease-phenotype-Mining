The aim of this work was to study the structure of nocturnal sleep in stroke patients with various lesion. 160 patients and 30 healthy controls were studied. In all cases the diagnosis was confirmed by CT or MRI. Clinical and neurological studies were performed and polygraph traces of nocturnal sleep (electroencephalograms, electrooculograms, electromograms) were recorded. Sleep parameters were analyzed using a program developed at the Sleep Studies Center, I.M. Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy; along with standard parameters, this program involves analysis of segmental structure of sleep. The most prominent sleep disturbances were seen in stroke in the right hemisphere. Frontal lesions cause reduction and derangement of delta-sleep, parieto-temporal stroke affects the second stage and REM-sleep and brainstem stroke in pons affects REM-sleep.
