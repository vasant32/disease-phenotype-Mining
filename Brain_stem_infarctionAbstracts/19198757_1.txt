A 39-year-old woman developed severe arterial hypertension associated with brainstem hyperintensity in T2-weighted images and hyperintense lesion in the left basal ganglia. Clinical findings were a sudden loss of consciousness, confusion, nausea, vomiting and headache. Rapid treatment of hypertension resulted in clinical and radiological improvement. Rapid identification and appropriate diagnostics are essential, as prompt treatment usually results in reversal of symptoms; permanent neurologic injury or death can occur with treatment delay.
