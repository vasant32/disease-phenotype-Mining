 OBJECTIVE: To define the arteriographic features of Klippel-Trenaunay sydrome (KTS) and explore the feasibility of the treatment with intravascular administration of pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion (PLE). METHODS: Seven patients with KTS underwent arteriography followed by therapy with PLE administration (containing pingyangmycin 8-16 mg and lipiodol 4-6 ml) into the trunk of the arteries of all impaired extremities. The therapeutic effect and postoperative complications were observed. RESULTS: Arteriography revealed abundant small branches of the runoff arteries, showing sinusoid changes of varied sizes in 5 cases by staining of the soft tissue. During the 3 to 30-month follow-up, swelling of the extremities was obviously improved in 5 cases after PLE therapy, which failed to produce obvious effect in 1 case and recurrence was detected in another. The major complications included paresthesia of the limbs, serum transaminase disorder and local skin necrosis. CONCLUSION: Arteriography can detect the lesions of the arteries and soft tissues in the affected extremity of patients with KTS, intravascular administration of PLE was effective to alleviate the hypertrophy of the limbs.
