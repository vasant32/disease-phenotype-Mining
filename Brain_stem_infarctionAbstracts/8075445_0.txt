A 46-year-old patient with 'locked-in syndrome' due to brainstem infarction developed symmetrically distributed, grouped erythematous cornified hemispherical papules on the fingertips and toes in 2 years. Histologically they showed psoriasiform changes. There was no evidence of internal malignancy nor a history of special drug intake. To our knowledge, such an eruption has not been previously reported.
