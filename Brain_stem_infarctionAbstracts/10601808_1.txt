Syringomyelia classically presents with slowly progressing dissociated sensory and upper and lower motor deficits. Atypical and acute manifestations have rarely been described. We report here on 3 patients with syringomyelia, who had acute and atypical brainstem symptoms with regard to the underlying disease. These symptoms occurred after acute elevation of the intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, respectively, and remitted subsequently. Vertebrobasilar ischemia was initially suspected.
