Various autoimmune diseases have been reported to occur in patients with sarcoidosis. However, coexistence of sarcoidosis and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is extremely rare. We describe a 59-year-old female patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis who had preceding APS. Her previous medical history consisted of a miscarriage and ischemic colitis. She was diagnosed as APS during the onset of a brainstem infarction with positive reaction to beta2-glycoprotein I-dependent anticardiolipin antibody. Two years later, chest CT revealed enlargement of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and small nodules in the lung fields. Transbronchial lung biopsy demonstrated non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma leading to the diagnosis of definite pulmonary sarcoidosis. This is the first APS case where pulmonary involvement with sarcoidosis has been confirmed through lung biopsy. Our case report suggests that APS should be recognized as an accompanying disorder of sarcoidosis.
