INTRODUCTION: Abuse of cocaine and other sympathomimetic drugs has been reported as a significant risk factor for stroke. The physiopathologic mechanisms implicated are multifactorial. Chronic cocaine use leads to extensive destruction of osteocartilaginous structures of nose, sinuses and palate. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 56 years-old woman with hypertension and smoke abuse who was admitted with a pontine paramedian infarction. Cranial resonance findings of midline destructive lesions lead to the suspicion of chronic cocaine consumption. The initial outcome was good but she was re-admitted nine months later with an extent pontomesencephalic infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Abuse of cocaine is a risk factor for stroke that should be considered not only in young patients. The pathogenic relationship between stroke and midline cocaine related destructive lesions is discussed.
