MRI appearance of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) has been rarely reported. We describe a new patient with confirmed diagnosis of TSC and MRI appearance of SWS and review the pertinent literature. We discuss these findings on the basis of the new classifications of brain malformations, which take into account the role of neural-crest. The coexistence of signs of both diseases in the same individuals could be explained by common altered pathways that could lead to an anomalous angiogenesis.
