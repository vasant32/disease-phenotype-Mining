We report three new cases of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS), with differing evolution and involvement, in which the diagnostic criteria were confirmed by physical evaluation, imaging techniques, radiologic and laboratory studies. Vascular malformation and soft tissue hypertrophy were evident in all three patients: two showed internal lesions and bony hypertrophy and one patient showed digital deformities. We review the main features of this important angiodysplasia.
