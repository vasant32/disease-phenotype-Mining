Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare disease involving a port-wine facial nevus and an associated intracranial venous malformation. There are no reports of this disorder in association with pregnancy in the English literature, and the effects of pregnancy on this syndrome remain unknown. We present a case of Sturge-Weber syndrome diagnosed in the early postpartum period and document the possible deleterious effects of gestation on the neurologic symptoms and ultimate prognosis.
