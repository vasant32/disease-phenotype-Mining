PURPOSE: To report bilateral choroidal hemangiomas associated with unilateral facial nevus flammeus in Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 6-year-old male with a left facial nevus flammeus and a history of a left cerebral angioma had been followed 2 years for increasing esotropia. Examination demonstrated bilateral diffuse choroidal hemangiomas with overlying exudative retinal detachments. After bilateral external beam radiotherapy, the retinal detachments resolved and vision improved. CONCLUSION: Patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome and unilateral facial nevus flammeus may harbor bilateral choroidal hemangiomas. Clinical manifestations of the Sturge-Weber syndrome are characteristically unilateral and ipsilateral to the facial nevus flammeus. Bilateral choroidal hemangiomas associated with bilateral facial nevus flammeus are rare. 1,2 We report bilateral diffuse choroidal hemangiomas associated with unilateral facial nevus flammeus in Sturge-Weber syndrome.
