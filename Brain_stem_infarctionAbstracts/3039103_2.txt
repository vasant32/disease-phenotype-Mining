We report 16 cases of lower limb hypertrophy seen in the past 5 years; of these, four had a typical picture of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. We discuss diagnostic modalities, complications, treatment, and outcome. Special emphasis is placed on the treatment with intermittent pneumatic compression and the importance of an organized approach to the condition.
