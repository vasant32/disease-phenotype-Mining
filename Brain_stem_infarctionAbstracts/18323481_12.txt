 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The prognosis of acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is poor if early recanalization is not achieved. Recanalization strategies include intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial thrombolysis, as well as endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EMT). The combination of IVT with consecutive on-demand EMT may allow for early treatment initiation with high recanalization rates but has never been systematically tested in patients with BAO. METHODS: Starting in January 2006, we treated all eligible patients with acute BAO admitted to our academic stroke center or one of our cooperating community hospitals after a standardized protocol combining IVT with consecutive on-demand EMT. Inclusion criteria were: (1) presence of predefined symptoms clearly suggestive of BAO; (2) exclusion of intracerebral hemorrhage on CT scan; (3) evidence of BAO on CT angiography; (4) start of therapy within 6 hours after symptom onset; and (5) no contraindications for IVT. If CT angiography showed persistent BAO after IVT, EMT was performed. RESULTS: Since January 2006, 16 patients have been treated. All patients received IVT; in 7 of them, EMT became necessary because of persistent BAO. Final recanalization was achieved in 15 patients. Three months after therapy, 12 of 16 patients were still alive; 7 of them had a good outcome (modified Rankin score <or=2). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the combination of IVT with on-demand consecutive EMT in BAO is feasible, allows for early treatment, and provides excellent recanalization rates.
