A 53 year old male was admitted with the diagnosis of brain stem infarction. Severe stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries was revealed by cerebral angiography. During the angiography, he complained of acute abdominal pain and was referred to abdominal surgical department. He was diagnosed as thrombo-embolism of the superior mesenteric artery and treated conservatively. The symptoms improved, but renal function became worse and the toe was found to be blue. Cholesterol embolism was suspected by nephrologists and thrombolytic therapy was discontinued. Steroid was administrated and LDL-apheresis was performed. The renal function was aggravating and hemodialysis was required. Emergency neurosurgical operations are sometimes performed immediately after cerebral angiography and the neuroanesthesiologists should be aware of the pathology of cholesterol embolism in perioperative management.
