Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome (KTWS) is a rare entity. It includes cutaneous hemangioma (Port-wine stains) of the face and extremities with associated varicosities and hypertrophy of underlying soft tissue and bone. Craniofacial involvement is rare in this syndrome. We report a case of Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome who presented with craniofacial deformity leading to deviated nasal septum, nasal obstruction and intermittent nasal bleed. These patients can have involvement of oral cavity and nasal mucosa with angiomatous malformation, which can give rise to epistaxis and excessive bleeding during oral and nasal surgeries. We discuss the review and management of such cases from Otolaryngologists point of view.
