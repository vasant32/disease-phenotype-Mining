We describe the relations between primary brain stem or cerebellar infarct or haemorrhage and secondary inferior olivary pseudo-hypertrophy (OPH). We identified 17 patients (43.6%) among 39 with brain stem or cerebellar vascular disease who had MRI follow-up more than 3 months after their ictus, with OPH. The primary lesions in the 22 cases without OPH were 11 haemorrhages, including 8 medial cerebellar and 3 brain stem lesions, and 11 infarcts: 4 brain stem lesions without accompanying cerebellar involvement, 2 cerebellar infarcts with brain stem extension, and 5 cerebellar lesions without a brain stem infarct. The causative lesion in the 17 patients with OPH included 5 brain stem and 7 cerebellar haemorrhages and 5 brain stem infarcts; no cerebellar infarcts without brain stem involvement were found to cause OPH. Primary involvement of the tegmentum of the brain stem was closely related to secondary OPH, but we could not characterise MRI differences in the cerebellar lesions between the patients with or without OPH.
