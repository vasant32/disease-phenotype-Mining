 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between diabetics and the onset, clinical outcomes and prognosis of brainstem infarction, and to evaluate the impact of diabetes on brainstem infarction. METHOD: Compare 172 cases of acute brainstem infarction in patients with or without diabetes. Analyze the associated risk factors of patients with brain-stem infarction in diabetics by multi-variate logistic regression analysis. Compare the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin scale (mRS) Score, pathogenetic condition and the outcome of the two groups in different times. RESULTS: The systolic blood pressure (SBP), TG, LDL-C, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), fibrinogen (Fb), fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c)in diabetic group were higher than those in non-diabetic group, which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). From multi-variate logistic regression analysis, γ-GT, Apo B and FPG were the risk predictors of diabetes with brainstem infarction(OR = 1.017, 4.667 and 3.173, respectively), while HDL-C was protective (OR = 0.288). HbA1c was a risk predictor of severity for acute brainstem infarction (OR = 1.299), while Apo A was beneficial (OR = 0.212). Compared with brain-stem infarction in non-diabetic group, NIHSS score and intensive care therapy of diabetic groups on the admission had no statistically significance, while the NIHSS score on discharge and the outcome at 6 months' of follow-up were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is closely associated with brainstem infarction. Brainstem infarction with diabetes cause more rapid progression, poorer prognosis, higher rates of mortality as well as disability and higher recurrence rate of cerebral infarction.
