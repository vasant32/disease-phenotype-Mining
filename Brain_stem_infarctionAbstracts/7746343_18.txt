Little is known about the pathogenesis and subsequent cellular biologic behaviour of human cerebral vascular malformations. Innovative therapeutic strategies will depend on more fundamental understanding of structural and functional lesion biology. We have freeze-processed four specimens of arteriovenous malformation (AVM), two cavernous malformations (CM), and resected cortex from one case of Sturge-Weber disease (SWD) for immunohistochemical studies. Probes of vascular maturity and cellular adhesion were examined, including Factor 8 related antigen (F8RAG), laminin, fibronectin, and adhesion molecules VCAM, ELAM and ICAM-1 (CD 54). Sections of the same lesions were permanently fixed and stained using Haematoxylin and Eosin, and MOVAT Pentachrome stain for identification of vascular wall structures. A double antibody staining battery was utilized with ultraviolet fluorescent microscopy, and was analysed by an observer blinded to the antibody and lesion type. All malformations showed strong expression on their luminal endothelial surface for F8RAG. There was no expression of ELAM in any lesion. Two AVMs expressed VCAM on the endothelial surface of some vessels. ICAM-1 was expressed faintly within two AVMs. The CMs expressed fibronectin within the endothelium and subendothelial matrix, and both lesions were devoid of laminin expression. The AVMs and the SWD vessels stained for laminin, while none of the AVMs expressed fibronectin. These preliminary observations are consistent with the hypothesis that AVMs and SWD represent more mature vessels, consistent with possible lesion genesis during early phases of embryonic vascular development (dysvasculogenesis). In contrast, CMs represent immature vessels devoid of laminin and other features of mature vessels, consistent with ongoing dysangiogenesis within a fibronectin rich matrix. Further studies should be aimed at better elucidation of these biologic probes, and correlation with specific lesion behaviour.
