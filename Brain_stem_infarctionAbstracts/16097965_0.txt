A 21 year old woman presented with coma and quadriparesis secondary to bilateral pontine infarction. Three weeks later motor aprosodia was the most notable neurological finding apart from mild asymmetric limb weakness. No other supratentorial lesion was noted on initial and subsequent multimodality magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance perfusion imaging revealed right frontotemporal hypoperfusion. This is the first report of aprosodia with an isolated brainstem lesion.
