Facial port-wine stain (PWS) may be associated with cerebrovascular abnormalities such as Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). In a large series, we aimed to assess which topography of facial PWS can predict SWS. This was a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with facial PWS seen in pediatric dermatologic or angiodysplasia consultations from 1993 to 2005 at the University Hospital Center of Tours. A standardized form was used to collect data on clinical and imaging findings. Patients with and without SWS were compared in terms of topography of the cutaneous angioma and related ophthalmologic and neurologic features. Two hundred fifty-nine patients were included, 15 with a diagnosis of SWS. All patients with SWS showed involvement of the V1 trigeminal cutaneous area. SWS was significantly associated with bilateral topography of the PWS, its extension to another territory, and involvement of the upper eyelid. Knowledge of the topography of facial PWS with risk of associated neurological or ocular anomalies allows for early diagnosis of SWS and avoids unnecessary and costly radiography for patients with uncomplicated facial PWS.
