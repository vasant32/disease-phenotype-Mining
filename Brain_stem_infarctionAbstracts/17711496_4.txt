OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and surgical outcome of elective laparoscopic surgery for acute closed loop sigmoid volvulus. METHOD: A prospectively electronic database of colorectal laparoscopic procedures identified nine consecutive patients with sigmoid volvulus managed by colonoscopic decompression followed by same admission laparoscopic recto-sigmoidectomy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and February 2007, nine patients, ASA I (one), II (four), III (four) with sigmoid volvulus were treated: seven were women. Their age distribution was 37-87 years (median 64). The volvulus was the first episode in one patient, the second episode for four and the third (or more) for the remainder. The median operation time was 115 min (45-145). No anastomosis was de-functioned. Postoperative analgesia was parenteral paracetamol (eight) supplemented by 10 mg oral morphine in one case; a ninth patient received patient controlled parenteral morphine for 36 h. Complications included: ileus (one), myocardial infarct (one) and wound infection (one). There was one death on day 32 from a brainstem infarct. Seven had an uncomplicated recovery. The median postoperative stay was 4 days (2-32). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic recto-sigmoidectomy postcolonoscopic decompression is a good option for patients with sigmoid volvulus. Surgical complications are minimal and recovery is quick.
