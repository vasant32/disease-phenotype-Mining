We studied factors associated with acute poststroke depression in 100 patients, aged 27-70, 2 weeks after their first clinically significant stroke. Depressive symptoms were relatively common (27% Beck Depression Inventory > or =10), but the prevalence of major depression was only 5.6%. Older patients were most vulnerable to poststroke depression. Patients with left hemisphere lesion had no more depression than other patients, but when the lesion was in the left hemisphere or in the brainstem, stroke severity was associated with depression.
