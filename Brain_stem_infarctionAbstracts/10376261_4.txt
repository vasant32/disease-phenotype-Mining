PURPOSE: This study was conducted to evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy, safety, and side effects of latanoprost 0.005% administered as adjunctive therapy in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) and glaucoma. METHODS: Commercially available latanoprost 0.005% was added as a single drop once daily to other antiglaucoma medications. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. A successful response was defined as a reduction of at least 20% in IOP at the final follow-up evaluation without additional medical or surgical therapy and no adverse events related to latanoprost. RESULTS: 18 eyes of 18 patients with SWS and glaucoma were enrolled from 9 clinical centers. Mean baseline IOP was 28.4 +/- 7.1 mmHg (range, 17-42 mmHg). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, a successful response to latanoprost was observed in 3 of 18 (16.7%) patients at the 6-month interval. Seven (38.9%) patients required surgery; three (16.7%) patients required additional medical therapy, seven (38.9%) patients had no change in therapy. One (5.6%) patient discontinued latanoprost treatment because of intolerable conjunctival hyperemia. Two successfully treated patients had significantly greater episcleral vessel engorgement after initiation of latanoprost therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with SWS and glaucoma respond poorly to adjunctive latanoprost therapy and often require additional medical or surgical intervention. Increased episcleral vascular engorgement might result in greater operative risks should filtration surgery become necessary in these patients.
