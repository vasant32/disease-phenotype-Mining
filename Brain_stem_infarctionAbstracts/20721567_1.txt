 INTRODUCTION: Septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) is a rare condition and has many diagnostic and therapeutic standards. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience with surgical and diagnostic management to provide a surgical pathway to help surgeons treat this disease. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed five patients who were managed surgically between 1999 and 2007. All patients underwent structured diagnostic and treatment protocols. The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant Score. PATIENTS: The patients had the following underlying medical conditions: laryngeal cancer, port-explantation linked to a rectum carcinoma, spondylodiscitis, and brain stem infarct with reduced general condition; one patient had no underlying medical problems. Three patients underwent a simple incision, debridement and drainage, and two patients underwent an extended intervention with partial resection of the sternoclavicular joint. The mean duration of follow-up was 29 months (range 24-36 months). All patients had well-healed wounds without signs of reinfection. The Constant Score for the functional outcome at the time of the last follow-up was 76 points (range 67-93 points). All patients recovered completely from SCJ disease. CONCLUSION: Our recommendations for the management of septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint include standard treatment steps and assessments. The early stages of infection can be managed by simple incision, debridement and drainage. In advanced stages of infection, a more radical intervention is preferable.
