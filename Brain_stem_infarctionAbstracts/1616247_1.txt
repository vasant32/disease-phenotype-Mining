Cerebral arteriovenous malformations with neonatal manifestations are infrequent and virtually always fatal. Heart failure with an intracranial bruit is the most common presentation. Exceptionally, the aneurysm is a manifestation of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome which is inherited on an autosomal dominant basis. Development of cerebral arteriovenous malformations occurs very early as demonstrated by the discovery of two aneurysms with major repercussions on the cerebral parenchyma in a female with severe prematurity. Pregnant women with suspected Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome should undergo ultrasound studies targeted at identifying untreatable cerebral lesions antenatally.
