We report herein the case of a 14-year-old girl with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome who developed an aneurysm of the transverse cervical artery. Because it was continuing to increase in size, with an associated risk of rupture, an aneurysmectomy was performed. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed a cavernous hemangioma located near the aneurysm. To our knowledge no other case of an aneurysm occurring in association with a cavernous hemangioma as a complication of Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome has ever been reported.
