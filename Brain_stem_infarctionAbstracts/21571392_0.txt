 BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is characterized by vascular malformations and disturbed soft tissue or bony growth, involving one or more extremities. A high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been reported in this disorder, along with cases of belated diagnosed chronic thromboembolic (CTE) pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence of CTE in patients with KTS. METHODS: Those from our KTS patient cohort willing to participate were examined with a sequential diagnostic workup including perfusion scintigraphy, computed tomography, and echocardiography. RESULTS: Of 68 patients, 48 patients participated in the study (median age 43 years; 29 [60%] were female). Eleven patients (23%) had an abnormal perfusion scan result, of whom computed tomographic scanning showed signs of CTE in two patients (4.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2%-14%); both patients had a history of VTE. Echocardiography showed no signs of CTEPH in these patients. In total, 23 patients (48%; 95% CI 35%-62%) had a history of superficial vein thrombosis and 8 patients (17%; 95% CI 8.7%-30%) had a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, which was associated with more shortness of breath. LIMITATIONS: Echocardiography was only performed in patients with CTE. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of patients with KTS had a history of VTE. The prevalence of CTE in the total KTS cohort, however, appeared less alarming than previously assumed. Based on these results, we suggest that there is only a limited indication for CTEPH screening among patients with KTS. Nevertheless, awareness for CTEPH remains appropriate, especially among patients presenting with shortness of breath and a history of VTE.
