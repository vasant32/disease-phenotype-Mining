Congenital vascular malformations represent a wide number of diseases with a great variability of clinical features. The association between congenital vascular malformations and peripheral aneurysms is very rare. The present study reports a case of giant superficial femoral artery aneurysm (7-cm-long) associated with Parkes-Weber syndrome (capillary malformation, multiple arteriovenous fistulas [AVFs], skeletal hypertrophy of the affected limb) treated by positioning two covered self-expandable endoprostheses after embolization of AVFs with Gianturco coils. The peri- and postoperative course was uneventful and the postprocedural angiography showed the complete exclusion of the aneurysm sac. At last follow-up, after 87 months, the duplex scan and computed tomography scan showed regular patency of the vessels with thrombosis of the aneurysm sac and the presence of a large number of AVFs. The association between Parkes-Weber syndrome and peripheral aneurysms represents a very unusual entity. The lack of evidence does not allow the establishment of the most suitable treatment for this disease. Endovascular approach associated with previous embolization of AVFs may represent a valid alternative to traditional surgical repair, which is still burdened by a high percentage of complications and failures.
