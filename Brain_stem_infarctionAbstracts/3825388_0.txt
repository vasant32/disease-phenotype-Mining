Forty-two patients with acute cerebral infarction were studied for the regional volumetric cerebral blood flow (rVCBF) and central hemodynamics (by integral rheography of the body) before and after the intravenous administration of 10 or 20 mg of cavinton (vinpocetine). It was found that in the absence of changes in the central hemodynamics an increase in the cerebral blood flow was the predominant characteristic, but parodoxical reactions were occasionally observed in the acute period of an extensive hemispherical infarct. The findings of quantitative frequency analysis of the EEG conducted in 40 patients correlated with the results of the study of the blood flow and indicated a more favourable prognosis in brain stem infarction or mild cortical infarction. Treatment of extensive cortical infarction was associated with cases of parodoxical deterioration of brain function which should be taken into account in prescribing cavinton to patients during the acute stage of cerebral infarction.
