We report the case of a patient with bilateral and symmetrical T2 hyperintensities of the middle cerebellar peduncles. She had a history of left pontine infarction 8 months before. This was attributed to bilateral Wallerian degeneration. MR Spectroscopy showed decreased N-acetyl aspartate/Creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio in the cerebellar peduncles as well as in the whole cerebellum. We hypothesize that this could reflect neuronal degeneration following a stroke.
