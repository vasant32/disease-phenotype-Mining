The Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome is a rare congenital syndrome of unknown etiology consisting of the triad: a large cutaneous naevus, congenital varicosities and hypertrophy of bones and soft tissues. A heterogenous group of vascular malformations may also occur. The case record of acute myelopathy in a patient aged 42 years with recognized KTW syndrome is presented. It is concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is indicated in cases of suspected intramedullary haemorrhage in patients with congenital vascular malformations.
