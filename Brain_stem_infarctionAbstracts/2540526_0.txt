A patient with intravascular coagulation caused by the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is presented; this is a rare phenomenon. The patient was treated with fast electrons. Sonography is a suitable method for determining the extension of the haemangiomas occurring in Klippel-Trenaunay's syndrome. This is important for therapy planning. With colour-coded Doppler sonography, arteriovenous fistulas can be ruled out, this allowing to distinguish the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome from the Parkes-Weber syndrome.
