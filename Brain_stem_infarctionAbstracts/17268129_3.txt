We report 2 cases of Gasperini syndrome and consider them with the 11 previously reported cases to describe the clinical characteristics of this rare syndrome: Core neurological signs are peripheral facial nerve palsy and abducens nerve palsy of the affected side: Among all cases, imaging demonstrated a small lesion in the mediolateral tegmental pons (10/13 cases of microinfarction; 2/13 cases of microbleeding). We found that the responsible artery in ischemic Gasperini syndrome is mainly the long circumferential branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery; Case 1 is the first case thought to be caused by infarction of the basilar artery's paramedian branch.
