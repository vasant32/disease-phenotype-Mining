Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are vascular anomalies containing a communication between an artery and a vein without an intervening capillary bed. In 1990, Klippel and Trenaunay reported a patient with limb overgrowth, cutaneous angiomata and varicose veins. In 1918, Parkes Weber mentioned the additional feature of AVM terming the condition 'hemangiectatic hypertrophy'. Most authors now consider both the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and the syndrome of multiple congenital arteriovenous fistulae to be two forms of Parkes Weber's hemangiectatic hypertrophy. Clinical and histological 'Kaposi sarcoma'-like lesions in the Klippel-Trenauny-Weber syndrome are well documented. We report an additional case appearing after minor trauma.
