 BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare congenital disease characterized by extensive cutaneous vascular malformations, venous varicosities, focal abnormalities of the deep venous system, and underlying soft tissue or bony hypertrophy. Given the rarity of the disease, there is little information available to counsel patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome regarding obstetric outcome. CASES: We report our experience with 3 patients in whom Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome complicated 4 pregnancies. Successful delivery of a healthy infant at or beyond 36 weeks of gestation was achieved in all pregnancies. One of the 4 pregnancies was complicated by pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome was once thought to be a contraindication to pregnancy. With careful management, successful pregnancies can be achieved.
