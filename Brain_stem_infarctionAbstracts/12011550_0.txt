 OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical features of and risk factors for recurrent pontine base infarction. METHODS: This study includes 5 patients with unilateral pontine base infarction who developed another infarction on the opposite side and, for comparison, 10 follow-up period-matched patients with unilateral pontine base infarction who did not develop recurrent pontine infarction. MRI and angiogram studies were performed in all cases. The two groups were compared. RESULTS: The patients with recurrent pontine base infarction developed quadriparesis, dysarthria and dysphagia. MRI showed bilateral infarcts abutting on the basal surface of the pons. Angiogram studies revealed diseased basilar artery in 3 patients. There were no differences regarding age, gender, angiogram findings and frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hypercholesterolemia between the patients with recurrent stroke and those without. However, the former had a significantly higher number of risk factors for atherosclerosis (p < 0.05) and higher frequency of coronary heart disease (p < 0.05) than the latter. CONCLUSIONS: The number of risk factors for atherosclerosis and a concomitant presence of coronary heart disease may be factors related to recurrent pontine base infarction in patients with unilateral pontine infarction. The main pathogenesis of recurrent pontine base infarction seems to be basilar artery branch atherothrombosis.
