Sturge-Weber syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by vascular facial birthmarks and neurological abnormalities. Oral cavity involvement may occur, and the extent of the vascular abnormality may vary considerably. The present authors report the case of a 6-year-old girl with Sturge-Weber syndrome, focusing on the clinical and radiographic features. Her dental management involved a multidisciplinary team and included orthodontic treatment using removable appliances.
