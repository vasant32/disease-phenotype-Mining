Summary: A unique case of Cerebrofacial Venous Metameric Syndrome (CVMS) in a 25-year-old women is described with venous malformations involving simultaneously the brain and the face. This case represents CVMS 2 plus 3 according to the classification described by Lasjaunias et Al. The metameric distribution of the cerebrofacial venous syndromes is well illustrated in this case. The extracranial and intracranial involvement is described and the appearance on MRI imaging is detailed. In our opinion this case demonstrates that cerebrofacial venous metameric syndromes include a wide spectrum of possible phenotypes including Sturge Weber syndrome and cases such as we describe here.
