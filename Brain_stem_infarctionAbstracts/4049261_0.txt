A case of a visceral pattern (with primary liver injury) of the Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is described with emphasis on the diagnostic difficulties due to the absence of external symptoms of disease and hemorrhage. Stress is laid on the importance of making liver biopsy in the diagnosis of this pattern of teleangioectatic disease. It is assumed that microcirculatory disorders in the liver provoked by the development of teleangioectasia are essential factors in the formation of liver cirrhosis in visceral pattern of the Rendu-Osler-Weber disease.
