 OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to describe the causes of Parinaud syndrome (PS) with diplopia to determine a topographic diagnosis and prognosis. METHODS: We studied patients with PS from January 1980 to January 2004 and reviewed causes and treatment. We identified all strabismus associated with PS. RESULTS: We included 18 patients with diplopia, 6 females and 12 males. Median age was 28 years old, SD 22 (10; CI 95%). Results are strabismus related: III nerve palsy in 15 patients (79%), optical nerve damage in 8 (44.4%), VII nerve palsy in 3, IV nerve palsy 2, bilateral III nerve palsy 2, nystagmus 2, Foville syndrome 2, one-and-a-half syndrome (1). The following causes were reported: tumors (6), brain stroke (4), cranial trauma (3), neurocysticercosis (2). Orthoposition under botulinum toxin treatment was obtained in 1.72 +/- 1.1 (0.65 CI 95%). Surgery was done in nine patients, and only one patient had spontaneous resolution of diplopia and PS. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to identify the topographic diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases such as the complete study of strabismus-related PS. In this way we can learn more about the extent of damage and can identify recurrences quickly in order to offer better control.
