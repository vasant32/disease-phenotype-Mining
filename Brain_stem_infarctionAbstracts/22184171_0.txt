We report a case of Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome in a 31-year-old woman who presented with hypertrophy of the left leg. She had severe osteoarthritic changes in the left hip joint secondary to the lack of acetabular coverage of the femoral head as the result of lateral inclination of the pelvis owing to leg-length discrepancy of 4 cm. The centre-edge angle (coverage ratio of the acetabulum to the femoral head) was improved from 15ยบ to 33ยบ after a foot lift. She underwent osteotomy and lengthening of the normal contralateral tibia using a Taylor spatial frame. Hip arthroplasty could be avoided as osteoarthritic changes of the hip joint had improved.
