A 21-year-old Italian woman with extensive Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) developed recurrent pulmonary embolism in spite of the insertion of a Greenfield filter in the inferior vena cava. Clinical and radiologic diagnostic tests failed to demonstrate the pathway of the emboli. Radionuclide venography and intravenous radionuclide total body arteriography were performed. These radionuclide procedures helped to evaluate the extent of KTS and to detect the route of the emboli. This is the first case of KTS studied with intravenous total body arteriography reported in the literature.
