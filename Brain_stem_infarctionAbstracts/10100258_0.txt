The Sturge-Weber syndrome consists of unilateral port-wine haemangioma of the face which may be associated with an ipsilateral intracranial haemangioma and choroidal angioma. The common derivation of the meningeal, choroidal and facial vessels may explain a congenital malformation of all three areas. I report the case of a child with typical Sturge-Weber syndrome who had a previously undescribed association with bilateral congenital syndactyly.
