Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening event. Before the era of cardiopulmonary bypass, acute pulmonary embolectomy had been historically attempted in patients with severe hemodynamic compromise. The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) represents a significant life-long risk for major thromboembolic events. We present two young patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome who survived surgical embolectomy after massive PE and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with good postoperative recovery. Even though the role of surgical embolectomy in massive PE is not clearly defined, with current technology it can be life saving and can lead to a complete recovery, especially in young patients as described in this study.
