Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a triad of cutaneous hemangiomas, varicose veins, and hypertrophy of soft tissue and bone; when combined with arteriovenous fistulas, the syndrome is known as Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. Orthopaedic surgical management of localized limb-length discrepancy or hypertrophy in these conditions is frequently indicated, especially in the lower limb. Forty orthopaedic procedures in 21 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Nine (22.5%) wound complications were identified in this study group. All the complications were associated with transverse amputations. All required significant further treatment and extension of hospital stay. Wound complications should be anticipated in patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome having orthopaedic surgical procedures, especially terminal amputations.
