Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of infantile glaucoma in the Sturge-Weber syndrome. We report the results of treating six patients with combined trabeculectomy and cyclocryotherapy. Successful control of the intraocular pressure occurred in all patients. Two patients required a second procedure at another site. We feel that the success of this procedure provides evidence that the glaucoma is secondary to elevated episcleral venous pressure in this condition.
