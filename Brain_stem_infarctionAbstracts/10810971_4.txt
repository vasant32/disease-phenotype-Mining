A case of endoscopic neodymium:yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser coagulation of a bladder hemangioma associated with Klippel-Weber syndrome is presented. The patient presented with extensive nevus and swelling of the left lower limb since birth. She was diagnosed with Klippel-Weber syndrome by angiography at the age of 1 year. Gross hematuria had been observed since she was 1 year old and, in addition, endoscopic examination revealed diffuse bladder hemangiomas. At 8 years of age, gross hematuria became worse and gait disturbance also appeared. She was referred to the Department of Urology at Tohoku University School of Medicine for endoscopic treatment in June 1998. Under general anesthesia, the bladder was inflated with CO2 gas and the hemangiomas were coagulated by Nd:YAG laser photonic irradiation endoscopically. Gross hematuria was markedly improved immediately following this treatment. Klippel-Weber syndrome is a rather uncommon disease which shows various types of vascular anomaly and hypertrophy of the lower extremities. Three to 6% of the patients have associated bladder hemangiomas. Although Nd:YAG laser irradiation provides results superior to alternative therapy and is the preferred treatment for most patients with bladder hemangioma, in this case, hemangiomas are multiple and present the possibility of re-bleeding, therefore long-term and close follow up is important.
