Ischemic lesions of the brainstem can lead to complex neurologic deficits. Failure of the automatic control of ventilation (Ondine's curse syndrome) is a possible but rare syndrome following localized brainstem dysfunction. We report on a 49-year-old man with intermittent bradycardia, cranial nerves' dysfunctions and a slight right-sided hemiparesis. An acute brainstem ischemia was diagnosed and treated immediately with high-dose heparin. Cerebral angiography revealed a proximal occlusion of the left vertebral artery but a normal right vertebral artery and a hyperplastic right posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Cranial Computed Tomography and MRI scan demonstrated multiple ischemic lesions in the posterior circulation. During a 4-week treatment course the patient underwent six episodes of acute severe hypoxia and hypercapnia requiring orotracheal intubation twice and manual ventilation by air mask over a few minutes for four times after a tracheostomy had been performed. Twice a short-term episode of hypothalamic Diabetes insipidus was observed following hypoventilation. We conclude that both Ondine's curse syndrome and diabetes insipidus were due to transient vertebrobasilar ischemia.
