Our clinical material of the last 10 years comprised 8 cases of phakomatosis with glaucoma: 6 children with Sturge-Weber-Krabbe's syndrome and 2 with Recklinghausen's disease. The age of the children was 15 months to 16 years. In 5 children with Sturge-Weber-Krabbe's syndrome glaucoma was found in one eye, in all cases with Recklinghausen disease it was bilateral. The following surgical methods of treatment were applied: trabeculectomy, trabeculectomy with cataract aspiration, cyclo-cryo-application and perforative cyclo-diathermy. The normalisation of the intraocular pressure was achieved in 88.9% of cases.
