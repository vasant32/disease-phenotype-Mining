The purpose of this study is to confirm the diagnosis of acute cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging using low field (0.2 T) magnetic resonance image(MRI). Acute cerebral infarctions in 51 patients were examined on diffusion-weighted imaging using low field MRI within 48 hours after clinical symptoms. Diffusion-weighted imaging was examined using line scan method. Twenty-four cases were cortical infarction, and twenty-two cases were perforating infarction. In five cases out of 51 cases, ischemic regions were not detected as abnormal high signal intensity area on diffusion-weighted imaging. Four cases of no abnormal detection were transient ischemic attack, and the other one was a perforating infarction. The earliest detection time in cortical infarction cases was 1 hour and 20 minutes. On the other hand, the earliest detection time in perforating infarction cases was 3 hours. Detective ability for acute cerebral infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging by low field MRI was depending on both size and lesion of infarction. That is to say, either small size or brain stem infarction was hard to detect. Thin slice and vertical slice examination for the infarction may improve to diagnose in low field MRI. Our conclusion is acute cerebral infarction was able to be diagnosed on diffusion-weighted imaging by low field as well as high field MRI.
