Combined palsies of cranial nerves, especially of the oculomotor nerves, are distinctly uncommon, even in patients with diabetes mellitus. We present a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, who had simultaneous oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsies. An MRI scan showed multiple brainstem ischaemic infarcts. The patient was treated with intensified insulin regimen and clopidogrel. Symptoms gradually improved, and at 9 months there was no further improvement.
