A case of Sturge-Weber syndrome with poor filling of the deep cerebral venous system is reported. Usually in this syndrome, enlargement of the internal cerebral, basal Rosenthal, deep medullary, and subependymal veins is revealed by angiography. The abnormality of the deep cerebral venous system in this case corresponded to diffuse faint calcification of the right parietal parenchyma. This was accompanied by venous angioma in the left cerebellar hemisphere and poor filling of the left cerebellar veins-findings which are rare in this syndrome. Occlusion or maldevelopment of the cerebral venous system in the prenatal period may be one possible etiological cause of these venous abnormalities.
