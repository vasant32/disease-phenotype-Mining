The computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and angiographic findings are described in a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, who also had a cerebral haemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation. The resulting aphasia disappeared completely after resorption of the haemorrhage. In this syndrome, the occurrence of a cerebral angioma has not previously been mentioned in the literature.
