We report on two patients who suffered from bullous pemphigoid and developed cerebral infarctions during the course of this autoimmune dermatosis. The first patient who had a bullous dermatosis for three weeks presented with a sudden paresis of her right arm. She improved under steroid therapy and developed a left sided hemiparesis after steroids were reduced for diagnostic purposes. The second patient developed signs of brain stem infarction during the course of full-blown bullous pemphigoid. Neither patient had known risk factors, signs of atherosclerosis or cardiac embolism. Both patients improved with steroids and azathioprine.
