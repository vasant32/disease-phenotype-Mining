INTRODUCTION: The Sturge-Weber syndrome is characterized by facial cutaneous angioma associated with leptomeningeal and cerebral angioma, typically ipsilateral to the facial lesion, which is accompanied by convulsions, mental retardation, contralateral hemiparesia, hemiatrophy, homonymous hemianopsia and glaucoma. Most of the patients with radiographic evidence of intracranial angioma develop convulsive crises, but only half have severe mental retardation. The image of calcification on cranial tomography often leads to confusion in diagnosis, especially with neurocysticercosis, particularly in places where this is endemic and the patients present with minimal skin lesions or these are at atypical sites. CLINICAL CASE: We present the case of a 13 year-old boy hospitalized with status epilepticus who, since the age of 1 year and 3 months, had had convulsive seizures which were of generalized tonic-clonic type and partially complex with secondary generalization, treated with carbamazepine at a dose of 400 mg per day. Neurocysticercosis was diagnosed on a tomogram showing calcification of the left parieto-occipital gyrus. Following physical examination and complementary tests the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome was made. CONCLUSION: We emphasize the importance of the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome, its clinical picture and treatment.
