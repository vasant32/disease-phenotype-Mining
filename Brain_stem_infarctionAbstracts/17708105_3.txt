The Klippel-Trenaunay-syndrom (KTS) is a congenital angiodysplasia of venous vessels characterized by three main symptoms: cutanous vascular naevi, hyperthropy of a limb and varicosis or venous malformations. The coincidence of KTS and arterial malformations such as renal artery aneurysm has been described twice in the literature. We report the case study of a 40-years-old male patient with KTS and aneurysms of a renal artery, the splenic artery, the superior mesenteric artery and of a popliteal artery and popliteal vein. After documenting the diagnostic and therapeutic course we describe this case as it relates to the clinical literature. In the differential diagnosis of KTS two different syndroms have to be pointed out: the Servelle-Martorell-syndrom and the Frederick Parkes Weber-syndrom.
