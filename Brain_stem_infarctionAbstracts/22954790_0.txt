Cell groups of the paramedian tract, which are located in the paramedian region of the lower brainstem, are eye-movement-related neurons that project to the cerebellar flocculus. Their inactivation produces downbeat nystagmus, which resembles eye movement disorders resulting from lesions of the cerebellar flocculus in animal experiments. Therefore, paramedian tract cells are assumed to fulfill an important function in ocular movement control, such as gaze-holding and maintaining vestibular balance. This paper presents a 50-year-old female who manifested downbeat nystagmus due to damage to the paramedian tract cells caused by a localized ischemic lesion in the medulla oblongata. We found that a paramedian medullary lesion-induced nystagmus, similar to that observed following floccular lesions, clearly indicates that a subgroup of paramedian tract cells projecting to the flocculus was impaired. This finding has important implications in considering a brainstem-cerebellar feedback loop involved in vestibulo-oculomotor controls, such as vestibular balance. Although there have been a few reports of downbeat nystagmus caused by lesions in the midline region of the lower brainstem, to our knowledge none report the occurrence of nystagmus due to a strictly localized medullar lesion, such as the one described here.
