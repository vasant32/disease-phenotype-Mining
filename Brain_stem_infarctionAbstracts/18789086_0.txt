A patient with extensive facial and intracranial features of Sturge-Weber syndrome was found to have a persistent primitive hepatic venous plexus, characterized by three additional vessels arising from the inferior vena cava, circulating between liver segments, which formed a common trunk in the supra-hepatic region that flowed into the right atrium. To the best of our knowledge, this hepatic finding has not been previously described in association with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
