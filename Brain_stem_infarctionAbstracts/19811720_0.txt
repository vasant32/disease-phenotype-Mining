A 75-year-old woman with known diagnosis of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome presented with acute onset of chest pain, dyspnea and elevated cardiac enzymes. She had triple vessel coronary artery disease on subsequent coronary angiography. Given the unavailability of venous conduits secondary to lower extremity varicosities, coronary artery bypass grafting with radial and internal mammary arterial grafts was carried out. The radial artery graft went into spasm two days later and required intracoronary vasodilators to relieve the spasm. The patient remained hypotensive and finally expired.
