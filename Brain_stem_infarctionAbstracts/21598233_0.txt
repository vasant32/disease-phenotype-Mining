Tc-99m sulesomab is indicated in bone and joint infection, but reading of scans can be affected by pre-existing conditions. This case report describes a case of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) which results in vascular malformations of one or more limbs. Tc-99m sulesomab imaging demonstrated persistent blood pool activity up to 20 hours post injection. However, despite this, septic arthritis could be identified with confidence in the same limb.
