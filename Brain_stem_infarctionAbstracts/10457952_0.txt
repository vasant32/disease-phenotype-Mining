We report a patient of atypical type of Sturge-Weber syndrome who demonstrated a reversible change by MRI FLAIR method in ictus and postictal state. A 5-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of severe headache, vomiting and loss of consciousness with his eyes conjugated to left for a few minutes. He had no facial nevus and other abnormal findings in physical examination. CT scan showed two small calcifications in the right occipital lobe. Postcontrast T 1-weighted image of MRI demonstrated a right parieto-occipital leptomeningeal enhancement. We diagnosed this case as an atypical type of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Although, on admission, FLAIR method showed the area of high signal intensity, after anticonvulsant therapy, those abnormal area disappeared. It is presumably detected by FLAIR method slight extravasation of plasma element in the surface of the brain due to regional hyperperfusion in ictus.
