Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is characterized by a triad of port-wine stain, varicose veins with or without venous malformations, and bony and soft tissue hypertrophy. It usually affects only one extremity. Its cause continues to be investigated, although theories abound. There is no predilection for gender or any particular ethnicity, and it appears more frequently at birth, childhood or adolescence. We report the case of an 8-year-old boy with this syndrome.
