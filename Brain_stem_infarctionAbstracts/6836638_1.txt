For the first time, a report is given on the percutaneous radiotherapy of hemangiomas of the choroid which could not be treated by photocoagulation. Diagnosis and control examinations of these tumors were performed by ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence angiography, and ultrasonography. Ten eyes (nine patients, three out of them with Sturge-Weber's disease) were treated between 1967 and 1982. A first group (five eyes, five patients) treated until 1974 received a target volume dose of 1,65 to 6,5 Gy combined with subsequent photocoagulation. All these eyes could be preserved. In addition, the second group (five eyes, four patients) treated since 1975 with unique radiotherapy showed better results with respect to visual acuity. The average follow-up period was four years (seven months up to nine years). Late effects were not observed. Even in case of advanced disease with retinal ablation and secondary glaucoma, an inactivation of the hemangioma of the choroid and a simultaneous regression of the secondary alterations could be achieved. According to our experiences, enucleations can be prevented by an irradiation with a target volume dose of 20 to 30 Gy.
