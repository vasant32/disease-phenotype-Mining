The authors report a case of complex angiodysplasia of the right lower limb, complicated by an ulcer of the ankle, and associated with a venous dysplasia, arteriovenous fistulae, and malformations in the distal arterial system. A deliberately partial embolization of the arteriovenous communications of the right foot helped to achieve scarring of the trophic disturbance.
