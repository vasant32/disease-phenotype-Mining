Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a disorder primarily characterized by capillary-venous vascular malformations associated with altered limb bulk and/or length. We report the identification of a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 8q22.3 and 14q13 in a patient with a vascular and tissue overgrowth syndrome consistent with KTS. We demonstrated that translocation t(8;14)(q22.3;q13) arose de novo. These data suggest that a pathogenic gene for a vascular and tissue overgrowth syndrome (KTS) may be located at chromosome 8q22.3 or 14q13. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to define the breakpoint on chromosome 8q22.3 to a <5-cM interval flanked by markers AFMA082TG9 and GATA25E10, and the 14q13 breakpoint within a 1-cM region between STSs WI-6583 and D14S989. This study provides a framework for the fine-mapping and ultimate cloning of a novel vascular gene at 8q22.3 or 14q13.
