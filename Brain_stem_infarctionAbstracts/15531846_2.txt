Phakomatoses or neurocutaneous syndromes are an important cause of seizures in the pediatric age group. The Sturge-Weber syndrome may affect the eye, skin and brain at different times. The skin lesions need not always manifest. We report a case of isolated affection of the central nervous system in a case of Sturge-Weber syndrome in the absence of ocular or cutaneous manifestations. Our case qualifies to be called incomplete monosymptomatic leptomeningeal angiomatosis.
