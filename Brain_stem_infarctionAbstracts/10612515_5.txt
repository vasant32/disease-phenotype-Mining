PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant in patients with glaucoma as a result of Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: Eleven eyes (10 patients) with glaucoma resulting from Sturge-Weber syndrome had placement of an Ahmed glaucoma valve implant from May 1993 to June 1996 at the Jules Stein Eye Institute. Success was defined by intraocular pressure at the last two consecutive visits of less than 21 mm Hg, no additional glaucoma surgery, no expulsive choroidal hemorrhage, and no retinal detachment. RESULTS: Mean intraocular pressure on the first postoperative day was 14.0 mm Hg (SD +/- 6.7). The cumulative probability of success was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% to 100%) at 24 months, 59% (95% CI, 20% to 98%) at 42 months, and 30% (95% CI, 0% to 75%) at 60 months. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of limited follow-up, the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant appears to be a relatively useful drainage device in eyes with glaucoma resulting from Sturge-Weber syndrome.
