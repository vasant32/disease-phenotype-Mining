Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in two infants with Sturge-Weber syndrome has demonstrated a pattern of accelerated myelination in the abnormal cerebral hemisphere. The extent of myelination was most apparent on the T1-weighted inversion recovery sequence while the T2-weighted images demonstrated concomitant changes in hydration of the brain. We propose an explanation for this finding based on cerebral ischemia underlying the leptomeningeal angioma.
