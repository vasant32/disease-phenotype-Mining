We describe a young woman with the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome in whom gross unilateral hematuria developed. A renal arteriogram showed a left renal artery aneurysm. Artery reconstruction was impossible and left nephrectomy was performed. Pathological examination showed multiple renal pelvic hemangiomas as the cause of the gross hematuria.
