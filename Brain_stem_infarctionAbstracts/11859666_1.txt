The authors report the case of a patient presenting with bladder haemangiomas in the context of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome treated by Neodymium:YAG laser. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome consists of a combination of hypertrophy of a limb, cutaneous angiomas and varicose veins. Bladder haemangioma is a benign congenital vascular tumour associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome in 3 to 6% of cases, especially affecting children and young adults. Its most frequent clinical manifestation is haematuria. The diagnosis is based on endoscopy. Endoscopic treatment by Neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser photocoagulation appears to be a satisfactory treatment option.
