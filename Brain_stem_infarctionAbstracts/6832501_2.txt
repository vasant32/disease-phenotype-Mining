A rare case of acquired dysarthria caused by a brain-stem infarct in a six-year-old boy is reported. Applying the analysis of Darley et al. (1969, 1975), 14 'dimensions' of dysarthria were recognised. The course of this dysarthria is described, by comparing samples of spontaneous speech, repetition and singing. The dysarthria is mainly characterised by imprecise consonants, distorted vowels, hypernasality and a breathy voice.
