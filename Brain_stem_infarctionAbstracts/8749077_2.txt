Neuro-otological and posturography findings in 15 patients with visually induced vertiginous symptoms (visual vertigo, VV) are reported. Most patients were considered to have peripheral vestibular disorders but one had cerebellar degeneration and another a brainstem stroke. Five patients showed abnormally large body sway induced by full-field visual motion stimulation; including the 2 patients with CNS disease. Four of these 5 patients had additional strabismic symptoms (diplopia, squint surgery and ocular muscle weakness). VV may occur if patients with balance disorders show high visual field dependence. The presence of additional CNS or strabismic symptoms, probably by reducing the ability to resolve conflicting visual stimuli, may lead to inappropriate postural reactions.
