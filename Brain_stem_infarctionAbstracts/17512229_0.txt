Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a facial nevus flammeus and extensive angiomatous changes involving the leptomeninges, the dura, and vessels of the gray and white matter. Oculodermal melanocytosis is characterized by hyperpigmentation of the facial skin in the distribution of the ophthalmic, maxillary, and occasionally mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.
