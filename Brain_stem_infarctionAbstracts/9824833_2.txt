Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome. Epilepsy is one of its most common features and is usually the first neurological manifestation. Adequate control of epilepsy assumes major importance in SWS as the early onset of seizures and severe seizures are associated with developmental regression and hemiparesis. Recent advances in neuroimaging have helped in making preclinical and early diagnosis in SWS. The author proposes treating newly diagnosed patients with severe SWS with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) before the onset of epilepsy. This may help prevent the development of hemiplegia and the developmental problems that may ensue.
