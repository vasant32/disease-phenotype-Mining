An individual in their 30s presented with quadriplegia and coma 7 h after a 30-foot free-fall. Angiography confirmed left vertebral artery dissection causing vertebral artery occlusion (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0) and basilar artery thrombosis. Deployment of six self-expanding intracranial stents (right P1 to left V3) resulted in recanalization (TIMI 3). Postoperative MRI demonstrated a large brainstem infarction; the patient was 'locked-in'. In the following 6 months, the patient recovered to ambulation and independence. Aggressive recanalization for symptomatic vertebrobasilar dissection/occlusion may be considered. Despite major diffusion-weighted imaging brainstem lesions, recovery is possible.
