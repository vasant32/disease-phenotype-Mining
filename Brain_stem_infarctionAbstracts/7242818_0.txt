The patient was a 48-year-old housewife, who had a sudden onset of severe headache followed by loss of consciousness for a few hours on the day of admission. Initially she showed slight restlessness due to headache, neck stiffness and subhyaloid hemorrhage. Four-vessel study revealed a basilar aneurysm on right retrograde brachial angiography and anterior communicating aneurysm on left carotid angiography. Two weeks after the onset, when she had no neurological deficit except for intermittent appearance of disorientation, both aneurysms were successfully clipped through right pterional approach of Yasargil. The subarachnoid hemorrhage was apparently due to basilar bifurcation aneurysm. Postoperatively, she showed right hemiparesis including her face, aniscocoria (left, 4 mm, oval: right, 1.5 mm, round) and conjugate deviation toward the left. The disturbance of conjugate eye movement and the hemiparesis completely disappeared in 2 and 7 days respectively. The patient was discharged 4 weeks postoperatively with mild left 3rd nerve palsy. At present, one year postoperatively, she is fully engaged in her housewife life without any neurological deficits. A case of superior Foville syndrome combined with Weber syndrome after clipping of basilar bifurcation aneurysm was reported and its anatomicoclinical mechanism was reviewed. The pathogenesis was supposed to be left midbrain ischemic lesion due to circulatory disturbance of P-1 perforators (P-1: proximal posterior cerebral artery); e.g., occlusion on clipping of vasospasm. This P-1 perforator syndrome after aneurysmal clipping has been reported only little. The importance of preservation of these perforators with careful dissection and manipulation under microscopy was emphasized.
