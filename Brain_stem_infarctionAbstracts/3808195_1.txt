The authors report a case of superficial temporal to superior cerebellar artery anastomosis (STA-SCA anastomosis) for progressing rostral brain stem infarction with an excellent result. Precise operative techniques were also described. A 47-year-old male was admitted to our hospital on November 9, 1984, because of sudden onset of dysarthria and ataxic gait. CT revealed a low density area in the pons. Left vertebral angiogram showed occlusion of the left vertebral artery just distal to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Arterial branch of the left cerebellar hemisphere were filled via the left PICA to the left SCA and anterior inferior cerebellar artery anastomosis. Right brachial angiogram showed the hypoplastic right vertebral artery which ended at the PICA. The rostral basilar artery, both posterior cerebral arteries (PCA's) and right SCA were filled through anastomosis from the right PICA. The posterior circulation was not filled by either of the carotid arteries. In spite of antiplatelet agglutination therapy, the patient had two more episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, right hemiparesis and gait disturbance. Because of progressing stroke, STA-SCA anastomosis was carried out on the right side on February 27, 1985. During operation, the blood pressure was maintained above the level of 130 mmHg, and intravenous mannitol injection and spinal drainage were done to preserve the right temporal lobe from intracerebral hematoma and/or edema caused by retraction. Postoperatively, the patient has been free from new ischemic attack. He has only slight hemiparesis now eight months after operation. Right external carotid angiogram showed a patent STA-SCA bypass and good filling of SCA's and PCA's bilaterally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
