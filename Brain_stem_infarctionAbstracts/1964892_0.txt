Eight cases (9 limbs including 8 lower extremities and 1 upper extremity) of the Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) are reported Among 8 cases, 7 cases were proved by surgery KTS is basically a sort of congenital venous dysplasia including venous atresia, aplasia, valvular anomalies, and external compression by a fibrovascular band or surrounded by a fibrous sheath. The basic clinical triad (vascular nevus, varicosities and limb hypertrophy) suggests the characteristic clinical diagnosis. KTS may be divided into four types. Orthodromic, deep venography is the most important examination in diagnosing KTS. Selective arteriography and direct puncture venography may be also used if necessary. The clinical features, angiographic characteristics, surgical problems, and the nomenclature, type and differential diagnosis of KTS were discussed.
