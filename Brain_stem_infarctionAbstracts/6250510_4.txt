Postdischarge progress in 11 types of patients was analyzed with regard to eating, dressing, transfers, bladder management, ambulation, cognition, language comprehension and speech, placement (living arrangement), and mortality rates. Of 273 patients admitted, 263 were available for foillow-up, which disclosed that patients with lower bladder management and cognition scores are more likely to be directed into restrictive discharge placements (p < 0.05), and that CVA patients with right and left cerebral hemisphere involvement, cancer patients, and patients with brain stem infarctions make significant postdischarge gains in ADL (p < 0.05). The majority of patients showed continual improvement after discharge, some making significant gains in functional competency. Such program evaluation offers a systematic method for forecasting post-discharge outcome.
