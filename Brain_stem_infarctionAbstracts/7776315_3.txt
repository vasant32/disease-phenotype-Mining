A primigravida with the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome was admitted to the hospital at 34 weeks' gestation with a complaint of right calf pain. Superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed, and she was treated with compresses and analgesia. Speculum examination failed to reveal the presence of lower genitourinary tract arteriovenous malformations. Color flow mapping of the uterus did not identify any arteriovenous malformations. The patient delivered vaginally at term, and the postpartum course was unremarkable. Pregnancies complicated by the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, related primarily to the increased risk of hemorrhagic diathesis. The mode of delivery should be considered carefully in an attempt to minimize the risk to both mother and fetus.
