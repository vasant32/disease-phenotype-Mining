We report on a case of Klippel-Trenaunay Weber syndrome (KTWS) associated with a reciprocal translocation [46,XX,t (5;11) (q13.3;p15.1)]. The patient has developmental delay and minor anomalies in addition to classic findings of KTWS. These data support the notion that Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome may be due to a single gene defect and suggests the possible localization of a Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber gene(s) to 5q or 11p.
