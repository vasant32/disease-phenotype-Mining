Two patients with reversible bilateral deafness of vascular etiology are reported. Serial audiometric studies in the first patient before and after a brainstem stroke indicated retrocochlear auditory dysfunction. The second patient showed bitemporal infarction on cranial CT scan which was subsequently confirmed postmortem.
