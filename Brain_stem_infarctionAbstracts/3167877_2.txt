The Sturge-Weber syndrome includes unilateral cerebral cortical angiomatosis, which often leads to progressive cerebral dysfunction and epileptic seizures that are medically difficult to control. Cerebral resections and hemispherectomy have been successfully performed in the past in intractable epileptic cases. Two children with medically unresponsive generalized seizure activity secondary to the Sturge-Weber syndrome have been surgically treated by dividing their corpus callosum. Cessation of generalized epilepsy was achieved in both cases. Corpus callosotomy is presented as a less destructive and safer procedure in dealing with intractable seizures in the Sturge-Weber syndrome.
