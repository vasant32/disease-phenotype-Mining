A girl (aged 8.5 years) with Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome received orthodontic treatment that included rapid palatal expansion. The patient had early and complete intraoral dental eruption with a posterior crossbite and an expressive transverse atresic maxilla. No carious lesions were found, but hemangioma-like changes of the mucosa were observed. A Haas palatal expander was activated for 15 days and remained in the oral cavity for splinting purposes for 6 months; it was then replaced by a removable acrylic plate with a Hawley arch. Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome did not impede rapid maxillary expansion, and the treatment was successful.
