Wallenberg's syndrome is one of the most common clinically recognized conditions due to brain stem infarct, which can nowadays be identified by modern neuro-imaging techniques. We describe a patient complaining of miosis, dysphonia, and dysphagia followed by ataxia. An MRI evaluation was performed including diffusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient, T2-weighted images, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and perfusion. A brief discussion of imaging findings is presented as well as a clinical correlation of the symptoms with the anatomic location of the lesion. This case report emphasizes the importance of imaging findings and their clinical correlation with neurological examination.
