Clinical and radiological findings of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia are reported in two cases. Myriad spidery pulmonary blood vessels are seen on plain radiographs and verified with right to left intrapulmonary shunting on pulmonary angiogram and pulmonary isotopic perfusion scan. Pathophysiology and differential diagnosis are discussed. We propose that the term "pulmonary angio-dysplasia" should include: 1) Pulmonary telangiectasia 2) Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome) 3) Classical discrete pulmonary arteriovenous fistula 4) Hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia: pulmonary arteriovenous communications with right to left shunting secondary to hepatic cirrhosis.
