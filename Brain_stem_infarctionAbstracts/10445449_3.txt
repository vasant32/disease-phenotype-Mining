We describe a cervical congenital paraspinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) drained by paraspinal and epidural ectatic veins, which caused massive erosion of the C6 and C7 vertebral bodies, threatening the cervical stability and necessitating treatment. During the first session, six arterial embolizations were performed to reduce the size and the flow of the AVM. Two months later, a venous approach was used to occlude the remnant venous exit of the AVM and achieve a complete cure. All embolizations were performed using N-butylcyanoacrylate.
