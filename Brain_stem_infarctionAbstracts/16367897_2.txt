OBJECTIVE: Acute stroke patients with dysphagia are usually fed by nasogastric tube. However, this method sometimes causes pneumonia or diarrhea. We investigated the use of a new feeding procedure called intermittent oro-esophageal (IOE) tube feeding in acute stroke patients with severe dysphagia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IOE method was used in 13 acute stroke patients (68 +/- 14 years old; 12 had a brainstem infarction), who were alert, but had severe dysphagia and a weak pharyngeal reflex. IOE tube feeding was carried out as follows. A feeding tube was passed orally into the lower portion of the esophagus, food supplements were administered through the tube at a rate of approximately 50 ml/min, and the tube was removed after finishing the supplement infusion. RESULTS: We found that the IOE method had the following advantages: (i) IOE feeding took approximately 15 min; (ii) potentially reduced a risk of complications such as pneumonia and diarrhea; and (iii) oral tube insertion stimulated the oral cavity and pharynx, which may improve the swallowing function. However, the IOE feeding method should not be used in patients who: (i) could not understand the IOE procedure; (ii) had an esophageal hiatal hernia or incomplete peristalsis of the esophagus, as such patients are at risk of having the supplement reflux into the oral cavity. CONCLUSION: The IOE feeding method may be one of the alternatives to continuous nasogastric tube feeding in acute stroke patients with severe dysphagia, who are alert.
