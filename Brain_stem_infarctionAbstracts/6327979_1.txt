Congenital dysplastic angiopathy (Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome) consists of angiomata and congenital varicosities with trophic changes of soft tissues and various parts of the skeletal system. Involvement of female genitalia is rare and has been reported to occur in only four patients. The authors treated a patient with a lymphangioma of the vulva associated with congenital dysplastic angiopathy.
