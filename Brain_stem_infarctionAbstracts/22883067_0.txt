 OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of interventional treatment of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome(KTS). METHODS: The clinical data of 20 KTS patients admitted into our hospital from March 2005 to October 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: All 20 patients underwent angiography after the relevant examinations. Among them, 18 patients underwent interventional treatment (embolization with PVA particles and spring coils). Two patients received no interventional treatment due to non-cooperation, high risk or extremely thin vessels. And 18 patients achieved excellent results after interventional treatment. Neither complications nor peri-operative mortality occurred. The patients were followed-up for an average period of 12 months. Mild symptoms recurred in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: Interventional treatment is an effective, safe and mini-invasive procedure for KTS with satisfactory long-term outcomes.
