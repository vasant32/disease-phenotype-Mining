During the treatment of two patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome interesting observations of the efficacy and the side effects of DHE were made. This led to the decision to carry out a validity study in 12 patients suffering from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The patients were treated with 0.25 mg or 0.5 DHE intravenously, and after that with 7.5 mg orally for one week. Before and after treatment measurements of venous capacity, microcirculatory parameters and rheological parameters were performed. Following the i.v. injection of 0.25 to 0.5 mg DHE the venous capacity decreased significantly in a dose-dependent way. The flow of erythrocytes in capillaries measured under resting condition was significantly lower and peak flow of reactive hyperemia decreased. No relation was found between the dose of DHE administered and the particular side effects (stomach trouble, increase in diastolic blood pressure) in 2 of the 12 patients. After oral treatment patients showed signs of subjective improvement of their complaints. On the basis of the results, the validity of non-invasive angiological tests is discussed.
