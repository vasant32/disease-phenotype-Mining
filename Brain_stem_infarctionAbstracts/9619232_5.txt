A 27-year-old female with Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome presented for reconstructive surgery of the deep venous system of the right leg. Contrast enhanced dynamic computed tomography was performed to exclude the presence of arteriovenous malformation of the lumbosacral spine. A combined spinal-epidural technique supplemented with light general anaesthesia was performed. The patient's condition was stable throughout the three hours of surgery and postoperative analgesia was maintained successfully for three days.
