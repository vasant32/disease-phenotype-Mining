Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by combined vascular malformations, varicosities, and limb enlargement. A child case of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome with a large cervicomediastinal cystic lymphatic malformation and a vascular mass on the chest wall has been presented to demonstrate combined use of conservative and surgical approaches in this syndrome. Cystic lymphatic malformation was treated by sclerotherapies including ultrasound-guided transthoracic bleomycin injection into mediastinal cyst, which was tried for the first time in the literature, and vascular chest wall tumor necessitated surgical excision.
