Three cases of Klippel--Trenaunay--Weber's syndrome are presented. The syndrome is characterized by cutaneous hemangioma, hypertrophy of an extremity and varicose veins. It is combined with angiodysplasias, either in the form of aplasia/hypoplasia of deep veins and/or in the form of arteriovenous shunts. The varicose veins will frequently be the dominant symptom, and it is emphasized that surgical treatment should not be instituted until the patient has been examined angiographically, with both phlebography and arteriography. The methods and the classification are discussed and the possibilities of treatment are outlined.
