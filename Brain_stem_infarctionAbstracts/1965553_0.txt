This study is based on the development of the surgical treatment of Klippel-Trenaunay's syndrome by means of an original technique which consists in the separation of the arterial system from the deep veinous system which we call: "Regional segmental skeletization". Moreover, it dries up the superficial veinous areas affected by the varices. A bibliographical and clinical review of the 120 cases studied is also carried out.
