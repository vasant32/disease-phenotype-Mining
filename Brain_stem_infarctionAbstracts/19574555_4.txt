 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) is a life-saving intervention for patients with malignant cerebellar infarction. However, long-term outcome has not been systematically analyzed. METHODS: In this monocentric retrospective study we analyzed mortality, long-term functional outcome, and quality of life of all consecutive patients that were treated by SDC for malignant cerebellar infarction in our institution between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients were identified. All of them were treated by bilateral SDC. An external ventricular drainage was inserted in 82%, necrotic tissue was evacuated in 56% of patients. There were no fatal procedural complications. Five patients were lost for follow-up. In the remaining 52 patients, the mean follow-up interval was 4.7 years (1 to 11 years). Within the first 6 months after surgery 16 of 57 patients (28%) had died. At follow-up, 21 of 52 patients (40%) had died and 4 patients (8%) lived with major disability (mRS 4 or 5). Twenty-one patients (40%) lived functionally independent (mRS 0 to 2). The presence of additional brain stem infarction was associated with poor outcome (mRS > or =4; hazard ratio: 9.1; P=0.001). Quality of life in survivors was moderately lower than in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: SDC is a safe procedure in patients with malignant cerebellar infarction. Infarct- but not procedure-related early mortality is substantial. Long-term outcome in survivors is acceptable, particularly in the absence of brain stem infarction.
