 BACKGROUND: Although Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome is a mixed vascular malformation characterized by abnormal growth in the extremities, no uniform diagnostic criteria have been established because of the variety in its manifestation. Consequently, no anatomical analysis based on a comparison study has been reported. In this study, the authors determine the frequency of various vascular malformations and abnormal growth and assess any statistical relationship between vascular malformation type/location and abnormal growth in terms of length and girth. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome satisfying the criteria proposed by Oduber et al. in 2008 were enrolled. The type and location of the vascular malformation and abnormal circumferential growth were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. Bone girth was assessed by axial magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography. Plain radiographs of the long bones were used to measure growth in length. RESULTS: The spectrum of vascular types was similar to that in previous reports. There was no significant association between leg length and vascular malformation type or location. Leg bone circumferential hypoplasia was observed in 50 percent of cases and was significantly related to the presence of intramuscular lesions. A single venous malformation in the subcutaneous tissue was significantly associated with the presence of subcutaneous hypertrophy. Patients with intramuscular lymphatic malformations had a significantly higher frequency of muscle hypoplasia. CONCLUSION: The type and location of certain vascular malformations were significantly associated with abnormal subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and bone growth.
