During the past 9 years and 2 months we have encountered 33 cases with cerebellar infarction. These patients were classified into 3 types according to their clinical course. Type 1 (18 cases); The course was benign, and symptoms and signs improved without surgical treatment. Type 2 (11 cases); The course was progressive with deterioration of consciousness between 24-72 hours after the onset. Type 3 (4 cases); The course was rapid resulting in lapse into coma within a few hours. Also, its prognosis was fatal due to coexisting brain-stem infarction regardless of any treatment. Surgical intervention was required for Type 2 in which the lesion included the region of the vermis or occupied more than one-third of the cerebellar hemisphere, and had subsequently compressed the brain-stem and caused obstructive hydrocephalus. In 9 cases out of Type 2, ventricular drainage alone was performed and prompt improvement of consciousness level was detected except in one case. We consider that ventricular drainage is not so invasive a method, and it is beneficial. However, in 2 cases of Type 1 and 4 cases of Type 2, hemorrhagic infarction occurred. Thus, one should be aware of the possibility of hemorrhagic infarction, even though it may be asymptomatic infarction. If prompt improvement of consciousness is not detected after ventricular drainage, suboccipital craniectomy should be recommended.
