A 63-year old diabetic man presented with left Weber's syndrome and meningitic syndrome. CSF examination showed moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated proteins with normal glucose content and sterile culture. Blood cultures yielded Listeria monocytogenes and the patient received ampicillin. While his neurological condition had partially improved, he died of heart failure. Several mesencephalic abscesses were found at autopsy.
