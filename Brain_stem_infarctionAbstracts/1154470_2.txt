A retrospective study of 141 patients whith ischemic brain stem infarction admitted to the Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki, during 1966 to 1973 was performed. The patients were contacted by mail in January and February, 1974; in case of death, the death certificates were procured. The follow-up period was from 4 to 99 months (median 46.5 months), during which a total of 39 patients had died. A life table analysis gave a 50% probability of a seven-year survival after the stroke. Survival was similar for men and women, and age appeared to have little influence on the prognosis with only a slightly higher case fatality in old age. Soft palate paralysis, disturbed sensorium, need of special treatment measures (feeding by gastric tube intravenous infusions, etc.) during the acute phase, abnormalities in the ECG (T-wave negativity, S-T segment depression), fasting blood glucose 100 mg/100 ml or higher, and an abnormal eeg (slowing down of alpha rythm alone or in association with paroxysmal and/or focal disturbances) were all associated with high case fatality. Preceding TIAs, blood pressure level, serum cholesterol and triglyceride values, and aortic arch angiogram findings, on the other hand, had no effect upon the prognosis. The effects of body build on prognosis remained obscure.
