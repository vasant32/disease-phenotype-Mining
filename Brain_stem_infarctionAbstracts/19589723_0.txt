 OBJECTIVE: Many infants born with a facial port-wine (PW) birthmark will not develop brain involvement of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). Previous studies have shown asymmetry in quantitative EEG (qEEG) correlates with degree of clinical impairment in children and adults with known SWS. We hope to determine if quantitative qEEG can be used as a method to predict which infants are most likely to develop SWS brain involvement on MRI. The current study looks at the ability of qEEG to differentiate between infants with radiographically demonstrated SWS and those without. METHODS: We first performed an observational study of qEEG results on eight infants with facial PW birthmark (four had SWS brain involvement). We recorded standard clinical EEGs and then derived a measure of asymmetry. We subsequently validated this threshold through a study of an additional nine infants with PW birthmark (five with SWS brain involvement). RESULTS: Quantitative EEG correctly identified infants with SWS brain involvement in all cases in the Validation cohort. This technique was at least as good as a pediatric electroencephalographer with extensive experience reading SWS EEGs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability for qEEG to discriminate between those infants with SWS brain involvement and those with neurologically asymptomatic PW birthmark. SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents an important step toward the development of a qEEG technique able to predict which infants with PW birthmark will develop SWS brain involvement.
