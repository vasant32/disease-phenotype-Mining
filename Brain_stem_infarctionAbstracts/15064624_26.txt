 OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of short- and intermediate-term postoperative complications after vestibular schwannoma surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review in a tertiary referral center. METHODS: In 400 patients who underwent surgical removal of vestibular schwannoma from 1984 to 2000,symptoms, preoperative evaluation, surgery, and postoperative complications were analyzed using standardized grading systems. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four men and 206 women had an operation. Mean age was 53.9 years (age range, 11-78 y). Tumor size according to Koos stage was stage 1 in 39 cases, stage 2 in 122 cases, stage 3 in 87 cases, and stage 4 in 152 cases. Preoperatively, 7.5% of patients had facial nerve dysfunction. Surgical approaches were translabyrinthine in 229 patients, widened retrolabyrinthine in 128 cases, suboccipital in 42 cases, and transotic in 1 case. Mortality was 0.5%. Facial nerve was transected in 15 cases (3.7%) and immediately repaired in 5 cases. A delayed hypoglossal-to-facial nerve anastomosis was performed in 12 cases. At 1 year, House-Brackmann grade in 70.7% of patients was 1 to 2; in 24.3%, 3 to 4; and in 5%, 5 to 6. Poor facial nerve outcome was correlated with tumor size, preoperative irradiation, and nerve dysfunction and was not correlated with the approach used. Most patients had postoperative dizziness, and 30% still had vestibular disturbances after 1 year. Nine patients (2.2%) had a cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, and 24 had a cerebrospinal fluid wound leak (6%). Twenty-two patients (5.5%) had postoperative meningitis. Two patients had a cerebellopontine angle hemorrhage, and three a brainstem infarct. CONCLUSION: Transpetrosal approaches (translabyrinthine, widened retrolabyrinthine) are safe for vestibular schwannoma removal, and rates of postoperative complications and sequelae are decreasing.
