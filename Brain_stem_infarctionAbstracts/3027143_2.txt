The Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome consists of cutaneous port wine hemangiomas, superficial venous varicosities, and soft tissue and bony hypertrophy of an extremity. We describe three patients with this syndrome with hypodense lesions in the spleen which in one case became isodense after bolus contrast CT. In one case ultrasound found numerous echopenic and echogenic masses. These lesions are presumed to represent multiple hemangiomata.
