Drooling is common in patients with neurological disorders. Recently, botulinum toxin type B has been shown to be effective in the treatment of drooling. The authors present a unique case of a 57-year-old man with a history of a brainstem stroke and severe drooling. The patient's parotid and submandibular glands were injected under ultra-sound guidance with botulinum toxin type B. Saliva was collected and quantified before and after the injections by 2 different collection methods: suctioning and dental rolls. Total saliva production decreased by 23.8% after injection of the parotid glands and by 85.8% after submandibular injection compared to the preinjection level. The 2 methods demonstrated similar results. In addition, the patient experienced less drooling and increased participation in therapies without any side effects. This case demonstrates that saliva secretion and drooling can effectively be treated by injections of botulinum toxin type B into the salivary glands.
