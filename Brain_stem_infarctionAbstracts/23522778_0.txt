Ischemic brainstem strokes constitute 10% of all ischemic brain strokes. Hemorrhagic complications are associated with an especially poor prognosis. Associated symptomatology includes vertigo, cranial nerve symptoms, and crossed or uncrossed corticospinal tract findings. Advanced neuroimaging techniques have become essential in the decision-making process of brainstem stroke management and may provide a means to identify those patients who may benefit from thrombolysis. Because many of the recommendations are based on limited data, additional research on treatment of acute brainstem stroke is needed.
