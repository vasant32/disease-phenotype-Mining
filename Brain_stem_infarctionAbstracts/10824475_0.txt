Brainstem infarction associated with the primitive trigeminal artery is rare. We describe the case of a 61-year-old man with an acute myocardial infarction as well as a brainstem infarction. The patient was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting. Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (left internal thoracic artery to the second diagonal branch anastomosis) could be safely performed 10 weeks after an episode of brainstem infarction.
