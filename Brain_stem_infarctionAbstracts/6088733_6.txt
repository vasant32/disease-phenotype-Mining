The authors describe the radiographic findings in a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome who also had aplasia of the left internal carotid artery and a very unusual malformation of the circle of Willis. This constellation of clinical and radiographic findings is unique and has not been previously reported in the medical literature.
