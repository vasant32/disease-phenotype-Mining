Reports of Bluefarb-Stewart syndrome have been infrequent. Two observations of this condition are described. Both patients are young men who presented with extensive angiomatous lesions of the feet, revealing distal arteriovenous fistulas. Surgical treatment was successful in one patient. Diagnostic criteria are discussed. As to pathogenesis the most likely hypothesis is that the arteriovenous fistulas are congenital. Bluefarb-Stewart syndrome can therefore be classified as one of the angiodysplasias.
