The Sturge-Weber syndrome was recently subdivided into type I (facial and leptomeningeal angioma, possible glaucoma), type II (facial angioma, without evident endocranial involvement), and type III (exclusive leptomeningeal angioma). Thus far in the literature only 24 cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome type III have been reported. This study presents a case of a 2-year 9-month-old child with normal psychomotor development and skin free (no angiomas), who presented repeated episodes of severe headache, vertiginous symptoms, vomiting, and drowsiness, separated by complete recovery. The cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium revealed left occipital leptomeningeal angiomatosis with calcifications, suggesting a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome type III. Considering the normal psychomotor development, the improved electroencephalographic reports between the episodes, and the absence of hypoperfusion areas on single-photon emission computed tomography at 30 months of follow-up, the symptomatology appears an expression of migraine-like symptoms resulting from vasomotor disturbances within and around the angioma, more than an expression of partial seizures arising through an epileptic focus in the ischemic region around the vascular malformation.
