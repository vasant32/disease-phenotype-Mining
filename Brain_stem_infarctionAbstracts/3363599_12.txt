Medullary disorders can be associated with a sleep apnea syndrome. The present patient developed a sleep apnea syndrome with approximately 25 episodes of apnea or hypopnea during each hour of sleep following a lateral medullary infarction. The presence of predisposing factors and involvement of respiratory centers in the area of the medullary lesion may determine the appearance of sleep apnea with brainstem infarction. Investigation of breathing during sleep may be helpful in such cases.
