The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of jaw and cheek support on nutritional intake. A 32-month-old child who had experienced a brainstem stroke was spoon fed, with and without jaw and cheek support, in an ABAB single case fashion. Jaw and cheek support elicited an increased amount of solid food consumption by the participant. There was no difference, between control and intervention sessions, in the amount of solid food expelled onto the bib. Jaw and cheek support enabled a 32-month-old child with a brainstem stroke to consume more solid foods than without support.
