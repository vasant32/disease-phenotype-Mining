Two patients with acute brain stem infarctions were examined angiographically and with the transcranial Doppler. One patient had a patent basilar artery but worsened clinically. The second patient had a thrombosis of the left vertebral artery which was dislodged with the angiographic catheter. Thrombolytic therapy was initiated. Serial transcranial Doppler examinations showed persistent patency of the vertebrobasilar system although the patient failed to improve. The usefulness of the transcranial Doppler in the management of acute stroke is discussed in the context of these patients.
