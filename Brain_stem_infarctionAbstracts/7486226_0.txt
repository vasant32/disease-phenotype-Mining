Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is characterized by the triad of unilateral port-wine hemangiomas, varicose veins, and hypertrophy of bone and soft tissue affecting one or more limbs. The rare F.P. Weber syndrome describes the mentioned entity and additional arteriovenous malformations. The association of an arterial aneurysm with the F.P. Weber syndrome has never been described in the current literature. A case of a brachial artery aneurysm in a patient with F.P. Weber syndrome is presented and the etiology of arterial aneurysm combined with congenital vascular abnormalities is discussed.
