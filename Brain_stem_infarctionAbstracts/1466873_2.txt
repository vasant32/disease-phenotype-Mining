Spinal cord arteriovenous malformations have been described in association with a variety of congenital diseases affecting the vasculature, including Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome and others, but rarely in association with lymphatic abnormalities. We report the case of a young man with congenital lymphedema and arteriovenous malformations of one lower extremity and a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation. Awareness of the possible presence of a central nervous system arteriovenous malformation in individuals with pre-existing arteriovenous and lymphatic abnormalities may be helpful in their diagnosis and management.
