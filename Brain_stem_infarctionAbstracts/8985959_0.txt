Hemodynamic changes following unilateral vertebral artery (VA) occlusion were investigated in a rat model. The left carotid artery was resected and anastomosed to the right side in an end-to-side fashion to create a half-ring bypass. The distal side of the bypass was regarded as a union of VAs. Changes in the geometry, histology and hemodynamics in the union were investigated after the recipient artery was ligated. Intimal thickening was most prominently observed in the recipient arterial segment distal to the ligation site, where the lumen was obliterated. However, the portion of the lumen within 2.6 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- s.d.) mm, a distance of 2.9 +/- 0.6 times the internal diameter from the union, was not obliterated. The angle of the union was positively related to the length of this residual lumen. The results of this study explain some of the pathogenesis in unsuccessful aneurysmal thrombosis or brain stem infarction after therapeutic unilateral VA occlusion.
