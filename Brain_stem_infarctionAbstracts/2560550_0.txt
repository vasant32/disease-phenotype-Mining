In 10 patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, we have examined 13 extremities presenting characteristic lesions, using a mercury-gauged plethysmography. All cases had previously underwent arteriography and phlebography. The venous volume increased markedly in 12 of these 13 extremities, as well as the arterial flow in 6 extremities. The elevated skin blood flow was demonstrated in 4 of the 5 hemangiomas by Laser-Doppler velocity measurements.
