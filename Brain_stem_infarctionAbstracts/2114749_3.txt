Five patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome were evaluated by conventional noncontrast spin-echo MR imaging, a gradient-recalled echo (GRE) technique, and T1-weighted spin-echo imaging after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. In four of five cases the full extent of intracranial disease was appreciated only on the postcontrast images. In one patient precontrast and GRE images were entirely normal, while only the postcontrast study demonstrated extensive involvement of both brain and retina. Nevertheless, some abnormal vessels with higher flows were seen better on precontrast T2-weighted images than on postcontrast T1-weighted images. GRE techniques demonstrated calcifications to best advantage, in one case even better than on CT. Contrast enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine is necessary for the complete MR evaluation of patients with suspected Sturge-Weber syndrome. Traditional noncontrast T2-weighted and GRE images may provide additional complementary information.
