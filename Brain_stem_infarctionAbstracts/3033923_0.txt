A description is given of a case of Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome diagnosed by sonography in the 28th week of pregnancy. The ultrasound findings established in the course of pregnancy are presented. Whereas minor variants of this syndrome normally do not represent a birth hindrance, a cesarean section was indicated in the present case on the basis of the size of the deformation--especially at the hip--an in order to save the child.
