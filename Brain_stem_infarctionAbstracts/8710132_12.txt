OBJECTIVE: We sought to demonstrate that isolated episodes of vertigo can be the only manifestation of vertebrobasilar ischemia. BACKGROUND: Isolated persistent vertigo is classically ascribed to labyrinthine disorders and is only rarely considered to reflect vertebrobasilar ischemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all of the records of the Saint Louis University Stroke Registry between January 1, 1992 and September 1, 1993. We set out to identify those patients discharged with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the vertebrobasilar system. We reviewed their clinical records and the results of their diagnostic studies. RESULTS: We screened 600 admissions and found 29 patients with vertebrobasilar circulation TIAs. Of these, five men and one woman had episodic vertigo for at least 4 weeks as their only presenting symptom. All six patients had one of two abnormal patterns on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): focal basilar stenosis or widespread vertebrobasilar slow flow. In three patients, the MRA findings were confirmed by cerebral angiography. Five patients were treated with warfarin and one with aspirin. Two patients developed brainstem infarctions, one of them fatal. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated vertigo can be the only manifestation of vertebrobasilar ischemia. Its frequency may be underestimated in clinical practice. Noninvasive testing is helpful both for diagnosis and follow-up.
