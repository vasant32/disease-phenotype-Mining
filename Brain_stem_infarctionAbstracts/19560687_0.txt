We report the case of a patient with vertebrobasilar steno-occlusive pathology associated with ischemic brainstem symptomatic lesions related to abnormal decrease in blood pressure (BP). A 63-year-old man presented vertigo and persistent gait impairment as a result of a posterior cerebellar infarction and, during hospitalization, experienced a new episode of cerebral ischemia in the territory of the anterior cerebellar artery. Cerebral angiography showed occlusion of the left vertebral artery and two severe stenoses of the right vertebral artery, and 24-hour dynamic BP monitoring evidenced severe postprandial hypotension. Medical treatment was not effective so he underwent an endovascular procedure. This report documents the importance of BP monitoring for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of posterior ischemic strokes and, above all, for a more reliable prognosis and therapy.
