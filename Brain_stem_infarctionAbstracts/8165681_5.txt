BACKGROUND: Basilar artery occlusion caused by thrombosis of atherosclerotic fusiform aneurysm of the basilar artery is rare. We present a case confirmed by 6 years of follow-up and autopsy. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man suffered from brain stem infarction. Computed tomography and angiography showed a fusiform aneurysm on the proximal portion of the basilar artery. At the time of the third attack 5 years later, complete thrombosis of the aneurysm was found, and the proximal basilar artery was occluded. On autopsy, an atherosclerotic aneurysm 15 mm in diameter was found. CONCLUSIONS: A large atherosclerotic fusiform aneurysm of the basilar artery often causes brain stem infarction and involves a risk of complete thrombosis of the aneurysm and subsequent parent artery occlusion.
