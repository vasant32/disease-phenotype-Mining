We describe two young adult patients with seizures and cerebral calcifications since childhood, diagnosed as Sturge Weber syndrome, who also had gluten enteropathy. Although the calcifications were located in regions similar to calcifications of Sturge Weber cases, many of the features of the syndrome were absent, and this diagnosis seems improbable. Whereas a coincidental involvement cannot be excluded, attention is drawn to this association between celiac disease and seizures with intracranial calcifications mimicking a Sturge Weber syndrome. After a gluten-free diet, antiepileptic therapy could be reduced in our patients.
