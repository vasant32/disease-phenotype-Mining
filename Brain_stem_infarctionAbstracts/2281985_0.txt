Morphological changes in the vascular malformations of pia mater and neighbouring parts of the brain surgically removed in 9 patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome were studied light- and electron-microscopically. On the basis of the results obtained the concept of Sturge-Weber syndrome pathogenesis is formulated. According to this concept the disease develops due to the brain hypoxia resulting from the long-lasting congestion in the pia mater with angiomatosis. Respectively, the surgical treatment of the disease is founded and the necessity of such a treatment at young age is outlined. The authors' own data on the nearest (up to one year) and remote (up to 15 years) results of such treatment are presented.
