The Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome is a triad of congenital anomalies characterized by a vascular naevus, varicose veins and hypertrophy of soft tissue and bone. A number of patients affected with this rare syndrome need amputation. In this paper the systemic problems, stump complications and prosthetic difficulties of four amputees with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are outlined. The period of follow-up ranged from 10 to 24 years after amputation.
