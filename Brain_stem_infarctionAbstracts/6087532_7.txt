Bladder hemangiomas may occur singly or in association with systemic arteriovenous malformations. Previously open surgical removal of these lesions has been necessary and endoscopic resection or biopsy strongly discouraged. We report a case of the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and a massive bladder hemangioma. Hemorrhagic complications were controlled by endoscopic application of neodymium:YAG laser photo-irradiation.
