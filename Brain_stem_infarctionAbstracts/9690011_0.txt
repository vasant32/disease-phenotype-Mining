An unusual case with Sturge-Weber syndrome is reported. A computed tomography study revealed the presence of gyriform calcifications in the occipital lobe, and discovered a hidden occipital subcutaneous port-wine nevus, instead of the usually expected nevus in the distribution of the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Existence of an occipital port-wine nevus, which was in the distribution of the greater occipital nerve, suggested a variation with respect to the embryogenesis of the Sturge-Weber syndrome.
