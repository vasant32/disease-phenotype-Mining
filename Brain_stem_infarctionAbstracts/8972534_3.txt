We examined the light microscopic and ultrastructural features associated with Sturge-Weber disease, including x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy to evaluate the chemical composition of the mineralized deposits and immunofluorescence microscopy with leukocyte adhesion molecules to examine the blood vessel proliferation further. Two patients (a 17-year-old girl and a 9-month-old boy) with Sturge-Weber disease comprise this series. Mineralized deposits stained strongly positive with von Kossa and negative with Prussian blue. Transmission electron microscopy of tissue removed during a functional hemispherectomy procedure in both cases indicated that most concretions were adjacent to or in the basal lamina of parenchymal vessels; no deposits were observed in leptomeningeal vessels. Energy dispersive spectroscopy of the deposits showed emission peaks corresponding predominantly to calcium, with lesser amounts of phosphorus. Fluorescent monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte adhesion molecules (endothelial cell, vascular cell, and intercellular: ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1) demonstrated strong positive staining of the meningeal vessels with all three antibodies. Cortical vessels were positive only for ICAM-1. Findings based on routine staining and energy dispersive spectroscopy indicate that the mineralized deposits detected in Sturge-Weber disease are composed primarily of calcium phosphate and are located primarily in and adjacent to the vascular basal lamina. There is an aberrant expression of ELAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the meningeal vascular proliferation similar to what is observed with other vascular malformations and tumors. Parenchymal vessel changes may be secondary to the meningeal vascular proliferation.
