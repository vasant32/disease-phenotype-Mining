CASE REPORT: We report on a 36-year old patient with a chronic leg ulcer at the right malleolus lateralis which persists since nine month and causes distinct pain. Furthermore telengiectatic erythema in terms of a naevus flammeus could be found at the right leg and foot as well as genital and gluteal. By birth the right leg of the patient was longer than the other one. In spite of initiation of several therapies the ulcer was refractory to different therapies. The clinical diagnosis of a chronic venous insufficiency of the right leg was clearly proven by apparative diagnostic. In consequence of all findings we diagnosed a Klippel-Trenaunnay syndrome consisting of the typical trias of naevus flammeus, hemihypertrophie of bone and soft tissue as well as angiodysplasies with a distinct chronic venous insufficiency. CONCLUSION: The presented case describes a patient with a Klippel-Trenaunnay syndrome as a seldom cause of a chronic leg ulcer. Although it is a very rare cause for a chronic wound it should be known by physicians to be considered in the differential diagnosis process.
