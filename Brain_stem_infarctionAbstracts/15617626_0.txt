Diffuse neurological manifestations of preeclampsia are due to endothelial involvement that lead to ischemia, hemorrhage, or edema. We analyzed clinical and radiological features and the course of brainstem ischemic strokes in a preeclampsia patient. We report a case of severe preeclampsia in a 30-year-old woman who was admitted 10 hr after a vaginal delivery at home. The pregnancy was at 39 wk, with no prenatal care. At her admission, she was conscious, and she had tetraparesia, swinging deep tendon reflex testing, drowsiness, and dysarthria; the BP was at 160/100 mmHg and 4 + proteinuria; magnetic resonance imaging revealed brainstem ischemic stroke. The evolution was favorable with symptomatic treatment. The patient was discharged on the 16th day; 2 months later she had a normal recovery. Brainstem strokes are rare. They are frequently due to hemorrhage; sometimes, they can also be ischemic. Their course is favorable.
