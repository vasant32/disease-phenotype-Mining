Torpid facial ulcerations may occur as a result of lesions involving the trigeminal fibers. These neurotrophic ulcerations have usually been observed after alcohol injection in the trigeminal ganglion. We report two cases associated with brainstem infarction. In both patients, the blink reflex was studied. The masseter inhibitory reflex was studied in one case. Analysis of these electrophysiological recordings can be of particular value in localizing the site of the lesion along the trigeminal pathway.
