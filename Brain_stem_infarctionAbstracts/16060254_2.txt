We report our experience with stenting for symptomatic vertebrobasilar artery stenosis. One hundred and sixteen patients with vertebrobasilar artery stenosis (101 vertebral ostial stenosis, 15 intracranial vertebrobasilar artery stenosis) were treated with stenting. Indication criteria of treatment were 1) symptomatic lesion, 2) angiographical stenosis more than 60%. Under local anesthesia, pre-dilatation was first performed, then stents were placed to the lesion. Successful dilatation was obtained in 115 cases. The stenosis rate reduced to 2% post-stenting in ostial lesions and 16% in intracranial lesions. Transient neurological complications developed in 2 patients. Follow-up angiographies more than 6 months after stenting were performed in 94 patients with ostial lesions and all patients with intracranial lesions. Of these, 8 patients (9.5%) with ostial lesions and 4 patients (27%) with intracranial lesions developed restenosis. All patients with restenosis were treated successfully with PTA (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty). During the follow-up period, 3 patients developed recurrence of VBI (vertebro-basilar insufficiency) symptoms due to restenosis. One patient developed brain stem infarction due to in-stent occlusion 8 months after stenting. Conclusion. Stenting for vertebrobasilar artery stenoses is feasible and safe. Prevention of restenosis, especially in intracranial arteries, is the next problem to be solved.
