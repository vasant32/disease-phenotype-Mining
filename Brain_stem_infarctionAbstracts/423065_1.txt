Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are a life-threatening, but curable, cause of persistent cyanosis in children. Abnormal communications may be single or multiple and are usually in the lower lobes. Three patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations have recently been managed at this hospital. Ranging in age from 2 to 4 yr, all were female, all were from families with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, and all underwent pulmonary angiography with confirmation of diagnosis. All have had uneventful resection, one of the left lower lobe, one the right upper lobe, and the other the right middle and lower lobes.
