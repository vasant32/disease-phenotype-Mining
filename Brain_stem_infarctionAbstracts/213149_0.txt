A case report of malignant external otitis is presented with particular emphasis on the neuropathological sequelae. The most striking finding was a mycotic aneurysm of the basilar artery with resultant thrombosis and brain stem infarction. Diffuse pachymeningitis was also present. The severity of the changes described in this case further point out the need for early recognition and adequate treatment of this potentially fatal disease complex.
