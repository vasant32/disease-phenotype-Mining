An unusual retinal manifestation of arteriovenous communications is reported in a case showing a combination of Sturge-Weber and Kippel-Trenaunay syndromes. The arteriovenous communications are thought to be similar to those seen in the limbs in Parkes-Weber syndrome. This retinal finding indicates that the three syndromes are intricately related to each other and may be an incomplete manifestation of a single pathophysiologic entity which may be named neurocutaneous angiomatosis.
