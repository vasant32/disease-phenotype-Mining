The vascular system of the head is of great importance in most types of headache because of the sympathetic efferents supplying the vessels. From neuroanatomic data it is to be assumed that vascular diseases of different genesis and cardiovascular diseases may give rise to headaches. The connection between headache and hypertensin is discussed at length with reference to pathophysiology. Further, headache is presented as a symptom with reference to observations of our own cases of inflammatory diseases of the vessels, sinus thrombosis, vessel deformities, accidents in anticoagulant therapy with subdural and intraspinal haemorrhages, cerebrospinal lues and endocrinopathies.
