INTRODUCTION: The appearance of movement disorders in vascular disease of the brainstem has hardly been described in the literature. Its frequency is probably underestimated due to their briefness and that they are often misinterpreted as epileptic seizures. Their pathophysiological mechanism is uncertain. Several mechanisms, such as the existence of a seizure-generating brainstem center, capable of generating epileptic activity or the interruption of the corticospinal tracts due to ischemia, have been proposed. CLINICAL CASES: We present three patients with disease of the basilar artery and extensive brainstem infarction who have the presentation of sudden, involuntary movements in limbs in the initial phase, in paroxysms of short duration and of varied semiology in common. We described this in all of them. An electroencephalographic functional study during these episodes was done in one of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of conscious level, its variability of presentation, the null response to antiepileptic drugs and normality of the electroencephalogram in one of them leads us to ratify the hypothesis of failure of the cortical inhibitory projections as subcortical centers in trunk or spinal cord as pathophysiological origin of these involuntary movements. We stress the importance of recognizing these clinical manifestations of appearance in the initial phases of the disease, that permit a rapid diagnosis with the help of the transcranial Doppler to establish an early and aggressive treatment of this disease having known seriousness and bad prognosis. Further prospective studies would be interesting to know what the real incidence of these movements is, and functional ones to clarify the pathophysiological nature of this phenomenon.
