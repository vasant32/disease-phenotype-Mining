6 patients with brainstem infarction and oculomotor signs were studied. One case was consistent with a mesencephalic infarct (internuclear ophthalmoplegia); 4 cases were consistent with a protuberantial infarct (3 cases of "one and a half" syndrome and one case of pontine reticular syndrome associated with a palsy of the root of the VIth nerve. One case was a laterobulbar syndrome. These 6 patients were studied with CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI CGR Magniscan 5000 with supraconductor magnet of 0.5 Tesla) with T2 weighted images (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 60; 120 ms) in joined section of 9 or 6 mm thickness. The MRI findings were in each case consistent with an infarction. The clinico-topographic correlations are compared with the oculographic findings.
