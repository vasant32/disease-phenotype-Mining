A wide spectrum of osseous abnormalities has been reported in association with vascular lesions. Enchondromas, bone hypertrophy, bone lysis, and sclerotic bone lesions have all been reported in association with hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, varicosities, and arteriovenous fistulae. These associations can be grouped into four major syndromes: Maffucci syndrome, mixed sclerosing bone dystrophy with angiodysplasia, congenital angiectatic hypertrophy (Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome), and massive osteolysis (Gorham syndrome).
