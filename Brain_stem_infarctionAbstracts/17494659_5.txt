SUMMARY: A patient with acute top of the basilar syndrome clinically was found to have only a small basilar artery filling defect but complete occlusion of the artery of Percheron. Intra-arterial thrombolysis resulted in favorable neurologic outcome. To our knowledge, this is the only case of angiographically proved and treated artery of Percheron occlusion. The value of this report is that reperfusion of ischemic areas was only achieved when persistent investigation disclosed artery of Percheron occlusion.
