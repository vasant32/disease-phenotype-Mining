The clinical value of determination of CNS-specific proteins in peripheral blood at the acute phase of ischemic stroke is unclear. S-100 protein and neurone specific enolase were serially quantified in peripheral blood at the acute and subacute phase of ischemic stroke (hours 4, 8, 10, 24 and 72 after onset of symptoms). Whereas S-100 protein was detected in none of the matched control subjects. this protein was observed in 17/24 of the stroke patients. Patients with detectable S-100 protein had significantly larger infarctions. Cortical infarctions had already significantly increased S-100 concentrations at days 1 and 3 compared to subcortical or brainstem infarctions. Patients with volumes of brain lesion of >5 ccm exhibited significantly increased serum levels of S-100 at hours 10, 24 and 72 compared to those with lesion volumes of <5 ccm. At hours 10, 24 and 72, concentrations of S-100 correlated with scores of neurological outcome. Although kinetics of release of neurone specific enolase showed a similar pattern of release in blood, no significant association to outcome or extent of brain damage was observed. These results suggest that S-100 protein and not NSE may represent a useful serum marker of brain damage in acute stroke.
