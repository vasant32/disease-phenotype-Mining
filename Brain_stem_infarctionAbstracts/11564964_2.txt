The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare disorder characterized by a triad of port-wine stains, varicose veins, and bony or soft tissue hypertrophy of one extremity. Digestive bleeding is the most commonly observed gastrointestinal manifestation. In rare cases, the syndrome is associated with malignancies. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman with KTS and dysphagia caused by an oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
