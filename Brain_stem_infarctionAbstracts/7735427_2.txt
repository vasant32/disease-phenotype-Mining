BACKGROUND: Hamartomatous dysplasias with hemihypertrophy are a part of several congenital diseases, sometimes difficult to classify when their symptomatology is relatively poor. CASE REPORTS: Case 1. A girl, 11 year-old, suffered from gigantism of the feet, left hemihypertrophy of the limbs, scoliosis and kyphosis. X-rays showed frontal hyperostose, bony and soft tissues overgrowth involving the left limbs and pelvis with hip dislocation and coxa valga. The vertebrae were hypertrophic and dysplastic. No tumor could be found. Case 2. A girl, 18 year-old, suffered from left hemihypertrophy of limbs and face associated with homolateral cutaneous hemangioma. X-rays showed enlargement of bone and soft tissue. No tumor or venous abnormalities were observed. CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of Proteus syndrome was made in the first patient while the second patient was considered to have Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome even though hemangiomatous involvement has been seen in Proteus syndrome.
