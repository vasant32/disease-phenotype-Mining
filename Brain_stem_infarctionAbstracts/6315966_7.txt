We were able to detect hemihypertrophy of a fetus in a routine prenatal ultrasound examination. The presence of hemangiomas and varicose veins in the hypertrophied left lower extremity at birth enabled us to diagnose the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The possibility of a congenital arteriovenous fistula causing the constellation of findings was ruled out by a nuclear flow study and a thorough physical examination. A computerized tomographic scan revealed that the hemangiomas were superficial in the hypertrophied left lower extremity and did not interrupt the deep muscle bundles.
