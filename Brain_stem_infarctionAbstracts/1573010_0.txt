A syndrome of capillary hemangiomas of the lower limbs associated with decreased circumference and length of the limb is reported. Hypotrophy of the limb in this syndrome is slowly progressive and surgery is usually required to achieve limb-length equalization. This syndrome is to be distinguished from the more common Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome of skeletal hypertrophy associated with multiple hemangiomas.
