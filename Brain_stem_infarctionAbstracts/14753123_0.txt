In four patients, a man aged 53, a woman aged 63 and two men aged 67 and 53 years, respectively, inspection of the hand led to the final diagnosis. In the first patient who presented with clubbing of the fingers and pulmonary hypertension, a small atrial septal defect was detected. The second patient had thick curved yellow nails and recurrent pleural effusions as part of this yellow nail syndrome. The third patient presented with clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, a secondary complaint to adenocarcinoma of the lung. The fourth patient had increasing pulmonary hypertension as a secondary complaint to recurrent multiple pulmonary embolism from deep venous malformations of his right hand, arm and shoulder as a part of the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. These cases show that inspection of the hand may give a clue to the diagnosis.
