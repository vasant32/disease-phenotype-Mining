In 14 children with Sturge-Weber syndrome, cortical calcifications on CT scan was present in 12, localized brain atrophy in 10, enlargement of the choroid plexus in 7, and abnormal veins in 7. Cortical enhancement was present on 12 CTs performed shortly after an episode of severe seizures or hemiplegia but was absent or considerably less marked at a distance from the acute episodes. We suggest that cortical enhancement is related to seizure activity and/or blood-brain disturbances rather than to the extension of pial angioma.
