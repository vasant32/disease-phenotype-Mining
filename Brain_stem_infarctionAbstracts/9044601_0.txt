The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare congenital pathology which includes varices, hemangiomas and hypertrophy of limbs. The Authors report two cases and pay particular attention to the diagnostic and therapeutical protocols. Although these aspects are still open questions, the Authors conclude that conservative therapy is often sufficient while surgery is requested only in the severe forms.
