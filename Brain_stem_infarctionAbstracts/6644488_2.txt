The formation of a massive choroidal effusion without hemorrhage during a trabeculectomy procedure was documented in a 17-year-old male with Sturge-Weber syndrome, most probably representing the youngest patient in the literature with this intraoperative complication. The occurrence of similar signs during a previous trabeculectomy procedure in the same eye, suggested the possible recurrent nature of this entity. Preparation of a posterior sclerotomy site before entering the eye during intraocular surgery in patients with Sturge-Weber Syndrome might help in the immediate management and in preventing complications due to the formation of massive choroidal effusion.
