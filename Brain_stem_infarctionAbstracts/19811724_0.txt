Weber's syndrome with vertical gaze palsy is rarely reported in literature. We present a case of a 47-year-old female who developed sudden onset of left exotropia, right sided hemiplegia and vertical gaze palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple infarcts involving both thalami and extending caudally into the midbrain. This case presents the diverse clinical picture following midbrain infarcts.
