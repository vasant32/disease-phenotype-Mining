Cerebral thromboembolism is a potential, although rare, complication of coronary angiography. An elderly woman presented with visual hallucinations, features of bilateral third nerve palsy, impaired vertical and horizontal gaze and mild motor weakness of the left upper limb, following diagnostic coronary catheterization. These findings suggested the anatomical location of the lesion to lie in the caudal midbrain, which was confirmed on computed tomography of the brain. Peduncular hallucinosis following cardiac catheterization, to the best of our knowledge, has only been described once in the literature. Awareness of this entity and its clinical presentation is essential for appropriate investigation and management.
