Sturge-Weber syndrome is known to be associated with migraine attacks and prolong aura even without cerebral infarction. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with type III Sturge-Weber syndrome developing with prolonged left homonymous hemianopsia after an intractable migraine-like headache and becoming a permanent visual field defect at 18-month follow up. By adopting a multimodality imaging study, we suggested that the underlying mechanism of prolonged visual field defect was due to blood flow disturbance and vasogenic leakage under the leptomeningeal angioma combining with atrophy and the damaged integrity of white matter in right occipital lobe.
