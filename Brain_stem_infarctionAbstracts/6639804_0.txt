Angiographic findings of the cerebral atrophy in children are discussed. Cerebral angiographies were performed on 20 patients, ranging from 6 months to 16 years of age. Their clinical diagnoses were H-H-E syndrome (4 cases), sequelae of meningoencephalitis (2), sequelae of head trauma (3), infantile spasms (2) and others (9). Final radiological diagnoses of these cases were hemiatrophy (14 cases), generalized atrophy (2) and focal atrophy (4). Circulation time, caliber of arteries, degree of opacification in cortical and deep veins and early filling of deep veins were investigated on angiogram. Slow circulation of cerebral blood flow was shown in 10 cases and normal circulation in 10 cases. Arterial narrowing was observed more frequently in slow circulation group. In cases with hemiatrophy, small caliber of the middle cerebral arteries and slow circulation on the atrophic hemisphere were demonstrated, but no abnormality on the normal side. Deep veins were prominently opacified in cases which showed poor cortical veins, the other way cortical veins were prominent in cases which showed poor visualization of deep veins. Cortical veins and deep veins may compensate each other in cerebral venous drainage. In most cases of slow circulation, dominant opacification of deep veins were visualized and these veins already appeared in arterial phase, but cortical veins had a tendency of poor opacification. These venous drainage patterns are similar to those of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Causes of these vascular changes are unknown. But they may play an important role in cerebral atrophic disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
