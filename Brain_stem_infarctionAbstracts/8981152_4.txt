Klippel-Tr√©naunay-Weber syndrome is a rare congenital deep-vein malformation. Pregnancy in patients with this syndrome is rare and only a few cases have been reported. Known obstetrical risks in pregnant patients with this syndrome include bleeding from angiomata in the genitalia, and coagulation disturbances. We present a 31 year old woman with this syndrome who, on two occasions, delivered small-for-gestational-age neonates. This may have been due to placental insufficiency caused by angiomatosis related to the syndrome.
