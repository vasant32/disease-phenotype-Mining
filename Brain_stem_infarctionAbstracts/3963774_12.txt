We correlated clinical, computed tomographic (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 14 patients with cerebellar infarctions. Before MRI, the diagnosis of cerebellar infarction was made in only 7 patients on the basis of clinical and CT evidence. Cerebellar infarction was bilateral in 3 patients and was associated with brainstem infarction in 6. Infarction occurred in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in 12 patients. The territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) was involved in 1 patient, and 1 infarction encompassed the watershed between the PICA and the SCA. In patients with infarction of the PICA territory, the medial and intermediate hemispheric segments were most frequently involved. Involvement of the lateral hemispheric segment was infrequent and was independent of brainstem involvement. Because of its fine demonstration of anatomical detail, its lack of bony artifact, and its ability to visualize infarctions readily within the first 24 hours, MRI is an excellent method for demonstrating cerebellar infarction.
