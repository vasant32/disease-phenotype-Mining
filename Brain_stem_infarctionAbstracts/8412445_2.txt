The authors discuss three patients with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis (GCA) who experienced significant auditory and vestibular symptoms. Two of the patients who presented with audiovestibular symptomatology died as a direct result of GCA affecting the vertebral arteries. Postmortem findings are reported. This report illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion of GCA in elderly patients who present with the acute onset of audio-vestibular symptoms. These symptoms can be a herald of brain stem infarction if giant cell arteritis is the underlying cause. High-dose prednisone and rheumatologic/neurologic consultation is required.
