 PURPOSE: Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare congenital neurooculocutaneous disorder. Ocular involvement can include glaucoma and vascular malformations of the conjunctiva, episclera, choroid and retina. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 16 children (16 eyes) with Sturge-Weber syndrome associated with glaucoma (mean age--34 month, mean follow up 8.87 years) treated in our institution, were reviewed. In retrospective analysis were assessed: IOP and postoperative complications after diode laser cyklophotocoagulation (16 eyes), after trabeculectomy (6 eyes) and trabeculectomy with MMC (3 eyes). RESULTS: In ten eyes (62.5%) good result (IOP 6-22 mmHg) post cyclophotokoagulation--(3x) was recorded, as well as in 3 eyes (50%) post trabeculectomy and in 3 eyes (100%) post trabeculectomy with MMC 0.2/4 min. No postoperative complications occured in cyclophotocoagulation group. Complications after trabeculectomy were the following: 3 cases of hypotony, 4 cases with shallow anterior chamber and 5 with choroidal effusions. CONCLUSIONS: Diode laser cyclophotocoagulation combined with topical medication is an effective and safe treatment of glaucoma in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
