Hypoxia-ischemia is a major perinatal problem that results in severe damage to the newborn brain. This study assessed functional integrity of the brainstem at term in preterm infants after perinatal hypoxia-ischemia to shed light on the influence of hypoxia-ischemia on the preterm brainstem. We recruited sixty-eight preterm infants after perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, ranging in gestation 28-35 weeks. Brainstem evoked response was studied at term age (37-42 weeks postconceptional age) with 91-910/s clicks using the maximum length sequence technique. Compared with healthy preterm infants, the preterm infants after perinatal hypoxia-ischemia showed a significant increase in I-V interval at very high rates 455 and 910/s of clicks (P<0.05, 0.05). III-V interval and III-V/I-III interval ratio also increased significantly at 455 and 910/s (P<0.05-0.01). The slope of III-V interval-rate function was significantly steeper than in the healthy preterm infants (P<0.05). Compared with normal term controls, the preterm infants after hypoxia-ischemia showed similar, but slightly more significant, abnormalities. The differences between the preterm infants after hypoxia-ischemia and the healthy preterm and term infants generally increased with increasing click rate. These results demonstrated that central components of brainstem auditory evoked response were abnormal at very high click rates in the preterm infants after perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. Click rate-dependent change in the more central part of the brainstem is also abnormal. Apparently, functional integrity of the brainstem, mainly in the more central part, is impaired. Hypoxic-ischemic damage to the preterm brainstem is unlikely to completely recover within a relatively short period after the insult, which is of clinical importance.
