Diagnostically and therapeutically, three types of angiodysplasias interfere with venous surgery: 1. Congenital arteriovenous fistulas (Type F.P. Weber: secondary varicosis with local gigantism)--surgical reduction of the shunt-volume is usually indicated. 2. Type Klippel-Trenaunay: Surgery for varicose veins is dangerous due to the frequent hypo- or aplasia of the deep venous system. 3. Venous hemangiomatosis (Type Servelle-Martorell or Kasabach-Merritt): Any surgical intervention is contraindicated (only external compressive therapy).
