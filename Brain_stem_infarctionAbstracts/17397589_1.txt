Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are rare anomalies that carry a considerable risk of serious complications such as cerebral thromboembolism or abscess and pulmonary hemorrhage. The first-line treatment of such malformations is detachable coil or balloon embolotherapy. However, coils and balloons may migrate and cause paradoxical embolism especially in malformations with large arteriovenous shunts. We report a case in which we used a new vascular occlusion device (amplatzer vascular plug), to occlude a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula in a patient with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome.
