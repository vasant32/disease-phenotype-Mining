Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) consists of a vascular nevus involving an extremity, varicosities of that extremity, and hypertrophy of bone and soft tissue. When arteriovenous malformation is also present, it is called Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS). Ophthalmic features of these syndromes include vascular anomalies of the orbit, iris, retina, choroid, and optic nerve. We report a case of a 16-year-old girl with KTS who was found to have bilateral optic nerve and chiasmal gliomas, optic disk drusen, and acquired myelination of the retinal nerve fiber layer. These findings have not been previously reported to be associated with KTS or KTWS.
