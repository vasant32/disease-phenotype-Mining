Thin-layer computed tomography of the orbit together with contrast representation by computed tomography in form of circulation studies is the only non-invasive method to represent intraocular hemangiomatous tumors hidden under an exsudative detachment of the retina. This method allows to establish exact tumor parameters which are necessary for an efficient therapy. In this case, radiotherapy with Cs137 is applied.
