 OBJECTIVE: To report the management of erectile dysfunction (ED) secondary to Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), a rare congenital vascular disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three men (mean age 33 years) with vasogenic ED secondary to KTS underwent venous ligation surgery of the affected veins. These men had tried various treatments for their ED, including phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and intracavernosal injection therapy, with little success. RESULTS: There was abnormal penile venous drainage in all three men, probably associated with congenital vascular malformation from KTS. After venous ligation the men were followed for 5 years and all reported good quality erections satisfactory for sexual intercourse. CONCLUSION: ED in men with KTS may be due to venous drainage anomalies and if confirmed, venous ligation surgery should be performed as this gives the best chance of a complete resolution.
