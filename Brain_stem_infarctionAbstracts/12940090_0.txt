OBJECTIVE: To access the diagnosis and treatment of Sturge-Weber syndrome at late stage. METHODS: The male patient aged 65 visited the eye clinic with presenting symptom of visual loss of the left eye for 2 months. Ocular examination disclosed a facial hemangioma with the size of 2 cm x 3 cm on the nasal side of the left upper eyelid associated with engorged bulbar conjunctival and episcleral vessels in the upper nasal quadrant. Ophthalmoscopy revealed total detachment of the retina. Esotropia was measured as 10 degrees. Intraocular pressure was 24 mmHg. Electroretinogram (ERG) demonstrated an indistinguished pattern. Posterior trans-scleral and ciliary body cryocoagulation was applied followed by external release of the subretinal fluid. RESULTS: The retina became reattached with visual acuity of 0.3 and intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg of the left eye at 5 months postoperatively. Fluorescein angiographical findings were consistent with diffuse hemangioma of the choroid. Follow-up study for 6 years revealed that the retina remained attached with visual acuity of 0.8 and essentially normal electroretinogram. CONCLUSION: The small facial hemangioma was the clue for the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome and cryocoagulation was the procedure of choice for the treatment of retinal detachment with favorable visual outcome.
