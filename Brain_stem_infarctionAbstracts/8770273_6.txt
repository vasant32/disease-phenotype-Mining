PURPOSE: To assess the size of the choroid plexus in young children with unilateral and bilateral Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: Subjects included 15 children 4 years old or younger with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Eleven cases were unilateral and four were bilateral. Unilateral or bilateral involvement was determined by the distribution of abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement on MR images. The diameters of the choroid plexus were measured on contrast-enhanced axial MR images. The choroid plexus of the affected and unaffected sides in these cases were compared with those of 15 age-matched children without Sturge-Weber syndrome who were being examined for seizures. RESULTS: Our results show a wide variation in the size of the choroid plexus in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome; however, plexus associated with a hemisphere affected by Sturge-Weber syndrome were significantly larger than those on the unaffected side and in the age-matched control group. The size of the choroid plexus was positively correlated with the extent of leptomeningeal involvement as demonstrated by abnormal contrast enhancement. CONCLUSION: The choroid plexus is enlarged early in the course of Sturge-Weber syndrome in both unilateral and bilateral cases. There is a positive correlation between choroid plexus size and extent of leptomeningeal involvement in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
