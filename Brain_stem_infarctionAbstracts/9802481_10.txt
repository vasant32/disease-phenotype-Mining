BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantitative MR spectroscopy has a proved role in the investigation of hypoxia caused by near drowning. To date, no studies have addressed the MR imaging changes that may also accompany this condition. The purpose of this study was to describe the MR imaging findings in children with hypoxic encephalopathy caused by near drowning and to compare these findings with the results of qualitative and quantitative proton MR spectroscopy and clinical outcome. METHODS: Twenty-two children (6 months to 11 years old) admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit after near drowning incidents underwent cerebral MR imaging and quantitative proton MR spectroscopy. Clinical and imaging studies were reviewed retrospectively, and subjects were grouped according to outcome: good result, persistent vegetative state, and death. Images were scored for edema, basal ganglia changes, and cortical changes, and were compared with MR spectra and outcome at days 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 or more. RESULTS: Six patients had a good outcome, four remained in a persistent vegetative state, and 12 died. Generalized/occipital edema correlated with poor outcome. Indistinct lentiform nuclei margins on T1-weighted images were a frequent finding (78%). Basal ganglia T2 hyperintensity correlated with poor outcome, progressing from a patchy/peripheral distribution to diffuse high intensity. Patchy high T2 signal in the cortex or subcortical lines were specific but insensitive for poor outcome, as were brain stem infarcts. CONCLUSION: MR images in children with hypoxic encephalopathy after near drowning show a spectrum of changes. The most sensitive prognostic result may be achieved by combining MR imaging with qualitative and quantitative MR spectroscopic data.
