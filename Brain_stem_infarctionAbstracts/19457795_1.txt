OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to describe the technique of direct CT venography and to describe various forms of venous anomalies detected with CT venography in patients with Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome. CONCLUSION: MDCT is helpful for visualizing the full length of extremities and for evaluating length and thickness on one image.
