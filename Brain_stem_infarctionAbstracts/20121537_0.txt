We report a case of brain stem infarction. The case is interesting for simultaneous occurrence of basilar artery (BA) occlusion caused by BA dissection and left internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection after a minor cervical trauma. Stents were implanted at the ICA dissection, and BA occlusion was treated conservatively.
