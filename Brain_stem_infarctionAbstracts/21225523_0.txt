Metamorphopsia is a visual illusion related to the perception of an object's shape, size, colour or angle. Reversal of vision metamorphopsia is a rare, transient form of metamorphopsia described as an inversion of the field of vision, usually a 180-degree reversion within the frontal plane. We describe the case of a 64-year-old male patient who first experienced a 90-degree rotation of the field of vision and then had the impression of his body rotating in space. The symptoms were preceded by disequilibrium, astigmatism and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed focuses of vasogenic lesions in the pons and left cerebellar hemisphere. Magnetic resonance angiography of cerebral vessels did not reveal the left vertebral artery. This is the first described case of reversal of vision metamorphopsia with 90-degree rotation of the field of vision with accompanying disorder of the spatial position of the body.
