A rare case of megadolichobasilar anomaly associated with localized brain stem infarction showing right hemiparesis and disturbance of consciousness is described. The etiologic mechanisms of brain stem infarction in this anomaly are discussed. The tortuosity and dilatation of the basilar artery were thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the brain stem infarction.
