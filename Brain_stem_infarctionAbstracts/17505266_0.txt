Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare autosomal-dominant vascular dysplasia characterized by telangiectasia, recurrent epistaxis, visceral arteriovenous manifestations and inheritance. Several reports have pointed out that hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia could be associated with various neoplasm development. Malignant melanoma has occasionally been reported.
