Basically, there are two conditions in which angiomatosis is associated with underlying skeletal disease. The first is Maffucci's syndrome in which angiomatosis is associated with multiple enchondromatosis. Two patients with this disease are presented and its clinical and radiologic features are reviewed. The second is "congenital angiectatic hypertrophy" in which angiomatosis is associated with localized hypertrophy of underlying bones, soft tissues and occasionally internal vercera. Four patients with this condition are presented, illustrating the subtypes of closely related diseases within a broad spectrum.
