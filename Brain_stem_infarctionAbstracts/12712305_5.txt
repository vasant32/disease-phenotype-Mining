There are many reports on acute cerebral infarcts diagnosed by diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), but few describe brain-stem infarcts diagnosed by this method. Using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), we studied 18 consecutive patients with brain-stem infarcts who underwent DWI during the acute phase. We calculated and compared the ADC ratio (lesion ADC/contralateral ADC) in 10 patients with brain-stem and 23 with supratentorial cortical infarcts examined within 24 h of the onset of stroke. Ischaemic brain-stem lesions were detected in all 15 patients who underwent DWI more than 3 h after the onset, but not in two who had DWI within 3 h of the onset; their ADC ratio was more than 0.95. ADC ratios in patients with brain-stem infarcts decreased as the interval between onset and DWI increased; the decrease was slower than in patients with supratentorial cortical infarcts.
