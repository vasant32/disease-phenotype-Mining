BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence in the diagnosis of cerebral infarction with MRI. METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 50 consecutive MRI studies ordered for suspected cerebrovascular accident. All studies included FLAIR and rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. The two sequences were compared independently by four observers at two different institutions. Detectability of lesions and image quality were scored. RESULTS: Overall, FLAIR sequences proved superior in 10 patients, detecting acute cortical infarcts missed with RARE spin-echo technique in five patients. In five additional patients, improved characterization of chronic infarction and improved detection of microangiopathic deep hemispheric changes were observed. One brain stem infarct was missed with the FLAIR sequence. CONCLUSIONS: FLAIR offers advantages in detection of acute infarcts affecting the cortical ribbon, is a useful, rapid adjunct to conventional T2-weighted spin-echo sequences, and has the potential to replace these in the future.
