ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION (AVM) OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH SOFT TISSUE AND SKELETAL HYPERTROPHY FORMS THE BASIS OF THE PARKES WEBER SYNDROME: a rare congenital angio-osteohypertrophy condition with no obvious racial, gender or geographic preference. Usually in the lower limbs, the AVM can result in a dilated cardiomyopathy due to a high output cardiac state. We describe the case of a 21-year-old woman with an extensive AVM affecting one leg, which included the pelvic vasculature. The case concerns assessment of the current high output "heart failure" and her cardiovascular risk from future pregnancy.
