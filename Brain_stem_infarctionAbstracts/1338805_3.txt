Seeing the diversity of the clinical look and of the subjacent malformations of the Klippel and Trenaunay Syndrome the following questions can be put forward: must the term KT be kept up? If not how to replace it? The mesoblastic sheet includes angioblastic, lymphoblastic and osteoblastic lineages. Each of them gives rise to malformations. All the malformations and all the signs and symptoms they generate may exist alone or mixed, the diversity of association is unlimited. Hence the syndromes too. They cannot be gathered under the sole term of KT. On the other hand to give each of them an eponym would lead to confusion. Therefore the author proposes to limit himself to the use of the term "type KT" when getting in touch with. Once the syndrome is investigated accurately it must be specified by the causal malformations, the associated malformations and the secondary troubles. It is the only way to be understandable and to allow statistical research.
