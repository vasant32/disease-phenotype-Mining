Of two patients who had acute neurologic damage from cisternal punctures, one died 17 hours following a tap which produced major subarachnoid hemorrhage, the other patient recovered from probable brain stem infarction associated with cisterna magna amphotericin injection. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is the commonest major complication of cisternal puncture, with at least 30 reported fatalities. Other serious complications result from direct puncture of brain substance.Cisternal puncture is not an appropriate alternative to a difficult lumbar puncture, and indications for its use are limited. The occasional required cisternal tap should be performed only by persons carefully trained in the technique, preferably utilizing fluoroscopic guidance, and only where neurosurgical assistance is readily available.Post-puncture subarachnoid hemorrhage accompanied by progressive obtundation requires emergency evaluation and consideration of posterior fossa decompression.
