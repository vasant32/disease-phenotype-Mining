The authors report a case of the rare association described in the title in which echocardiography played an important role in the recognition of the pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm. By 2-D approach it was possible to visualize a wide anechogenic concamerated area containing an echodense mass and continuous with the left heart cavities. Pulsed Doppler interrogation at the level of the extra-cardiac cavity showed a flow signal which gave the first diagnostic evidence of a vascular lesion. Direct visualization of pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysms has never before been obtained with echocardiography. This was possible in the present case due to contiguity with heart chambers and the large dimension of the aneurysm. Doppler examination gave the first confirmation of the vascular nature of the lesion. Angiography is still a mandatory pre-operative procedure but 2-D and Doppler echocardiography may play an interesting role in the diagnostic non invasive procedure of pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysms.
