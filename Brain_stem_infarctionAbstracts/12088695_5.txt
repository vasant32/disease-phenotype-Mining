 OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to assess the extent of functional involvement of the affected hemisphere in Sturge Weber syndrome in comparison with the uninvolved hemisphere. To this end beta activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured, both before and after administration of diazepam intravenously (i.v.). METHODS: In 9 patients asymmetry in beta band activity was studied before and after diazepam administration. Several beta bands and asymmetry parameters were calculated. beta band asymmetries were compared with structural abnormalities (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). RESULTS: Total beta activity was reduced in the involved hemisphere in all patients after diazepam administration. In 3 patients functional abnormalities were found in brain regions that were structurally intact. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased diazepam-enhanced beta activity in the EEG is a sensitive criterion of functional abnormality. In patients with subtle structural abnormalities diazepam-enhanced EEG may have added value in diagnosing functional involvement and in monitoring disease progression in patients.
