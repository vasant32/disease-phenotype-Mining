The CT criteria of the Sturge-Weber syndrome are described on the basis of 5 cases observed by the authors. Computerized tomography makes it possible to identify earlier - and in some cases more clearly - than by conventional roentgenography, the classical signs of the disease (calcification of the cerebral cortex, unilateral shrinking of the skullcap, distension of the frontal and sphenoidal sinus, thickening of the skullcap as a whole). Anomalies of vascularization, which had so far been demonstrable only by invasive methods, can also be demonstrated direct by means of computerized tomography.
