 BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery (VA) transection is a rarely described entity that may present dramatically with a life-threatening external hemorrhage. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old man that was victim of a terrorist attack presented a gunshot wound to the mouth with massive bleeding. The bullet perforated the oropharynx and injured the right VA. Combined antegrade and retrograde endovascular embolization by means of detachable coils allowed rapid control of the bleeding. CONCLUSION: Bleeding related to VA transection can be managed safely by means of endovascular combined approaches.
