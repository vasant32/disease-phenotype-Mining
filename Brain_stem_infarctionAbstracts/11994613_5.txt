The association of three physical findings including capillary malformation, varicosities, and hypertrophy of bony and soft tissues corresponds to Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. This triad of findings, described by the two French physicians Klippel and Trenaunay in 1900, differs from Parkes-Weber syndrome, in that Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome does not incorporate significant hemodynamic arteriovenous fistulas. Generally, management of this disease process should be individualized. Surgery should be considered in cases where skin ulcerations lead to persisting and recurrent bleeding, or where digital deformities lead to functional disabilities or where significant limb overgrowth leads to both functional and psychological impairment. Persistent hematochezia, hematuria, and vaginal and esophageal bleeding are considered indications for surgical intervention. Recurrent attacks of thrombophlebitis and cellulitis are treated medically with antiinflammatory agents and antibiotics. Otherwise, management of this syndrome is generally conservative, consisting of psychological encouragement, reassurance, and the continued use of graduated compressive stockings for varicosities and intermittent pneumatic compression pumps for lymphatic edema.
