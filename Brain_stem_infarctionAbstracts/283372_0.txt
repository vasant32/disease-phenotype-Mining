A case of a child with acute lymphocytic Leukemia is reported. The roentgenograms of the skull show intracerebral "railroad-track-like" calcifications mimicking those seen in Sturge-Weber syndrome. These calcifications are described and their etiology is discussed. The frequency of such observations in cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia with CNS-treatment is increasing.
