Eight patients with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome were treated for leg length inequality of as much as 10 cm in one ten year old, and one thirteen year old. In most cases adequate correction was achieved with epiphyseal stapling during active growth or definitive epiphysiodesis in older children. Bone shortening procedures in full-grown individuals may be indicated but the basic condition may make healing difficult. Ligation of the femoral artery had no effect on the growth of the affected leg.
