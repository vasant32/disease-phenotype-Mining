Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) is a rare, congenital vascular disorder characterized by cutaneous haemangiomas, venous varicosities, and hypertrophy of the osseous and soft tissue. Various vascular anomalies of the central nervous system have been described in this syndrome. Two previous associations between KTWS and spinal cord cavernous malformations have been reported in the English literature.  In this report, we present a patient in whom multiple cavernous malformations located in the conus medullaris region and cauda equina were associated with KTWS. General physical examination as well as neuroradiological and operative findings are described.
