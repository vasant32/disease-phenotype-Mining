Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is known as a cerebellar hemispheric hypometabolism due to contralateral supratentorial infarction or tumor. We report a case with the Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), whose cerebral blood flow was reduced in the anatomically affected lesion of cerebrum and in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Not only acquired diaschisis, but congenital ischemic disorders such as SWS also showed CCD.
