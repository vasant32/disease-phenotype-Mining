Bruns-Cushing nystagmus is unusually rare and is known to be related with cerebellopontine angle tumor. A 32-year-old male patient came to our emergency department 3 times because of dizziness, right upper limb ataxia, hypertension, and Bruns-Cushing nystagmus. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated left paramedian pontine infarction. In conclusion, Bruns-Cushing nystagmus not only indicates a cerebellopontine angle tumor but may also be associated with pontine infarction.
