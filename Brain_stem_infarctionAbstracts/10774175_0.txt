A 58-year-old man with a history of cerebral infarction and bleeding due to duodenal ulcer was admitted with fever and arthralgia. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was isolated from his peripheral blood. Bacteremia with MSSA was diagnosed, and antibiotic therapy was started. However, chest X-ray films and computed tomographic scans disclosed mass shadows in both lungs accompanied by dilated vascular markings. Pulmonary arteriography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed the existence of arteriovenous fistulas in both lungs. Ga scintigraphy disclosed a hot spot in the left lower lobe, consistent with the location of one fistula. This indicated that the fistula might be the focus of MSSA sepsis. Because the patient also had telangiectasia in his gastric mucosa, oral cavity, and nasal cavity, he was given a diagnosis of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome.
