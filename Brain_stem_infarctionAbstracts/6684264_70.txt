We studied six patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of rostral brainstem lesion and bilateral blepharospasm. Two patients also had other facial dystonic movements. Four patients suffered rostral brainstem strokes, and two had multiple sclerosis. None had been treated with antipsychotic drugs prior to the onset of blepharospasm. Medical treatment was helpful in two patients, and bilateral selective facial nerve section was used in another patient. Possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.
