Technetium-99m-HMPAO interictal SPECT was performed on three pediatric patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). RESULTS: Brain SPECT of all three patients demonstrated markedly diminished tracer localization in the affected hemisphere. In one patient, the SPECT abnormality was more extensive than the associated abnormalities on CT and MRI. CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m-HMPAO brain SPECT can detect cerebral perfusion abnormalities associated with SWS and deserves consideration in the imaging evaluation of SWS patients.
