PURPOSE: To report the outcome and complications of 10 eyes of 9 children with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) who underwent two-stage insertion of a Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI) for glaucoma. DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: The authors reviewed the medical records of children under the age of 14 years with SWS who underwent two-stage BGI for glaucoma at two tertiary care referral centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraoperative and postoperative complications, intraocular pressure (IOP), number of glaucoma medications, visual acuity, and further surgical intervention. RESULTS: Ten eyes of nine patients were included in the study. Ages of the nine patients at time of first stage BGI ranged between 6 weeks and 13 years. With average follow-up of 35 months (range, 10-50), all eyes had adequate IOP control (< or = 21 mmHg) without the need for additional glaucoma surgery. Intraocular pressure was reduced from a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 24.8 +/- 6.2 mmHg preoperatively to 16.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg at last follow-up visit (P = 0.001). The number of medications used for control of glaucoma was reduced from a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 1.8 +/- 1.0 preoperatively to 1.1 +/- 1.4 at last follow-up visit (P = 0.2). One eye had serous choroidal effusions with overlying serous retinal detachment that resolved spontaneously after 7 days with no permanent visual loss, and one eye had low choroidal effusion that lasted 4 days. There were no intraoperative or postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhages. At last follow-up, visual acuity had improved by one or more lines in all patients in whom vision was measurable. CONCLUSIONS: Two-stage BGI surgery appears to be a safe and effective treatment for refractory glaucoma in children with SWS.
