Clinical features of pontine infarction depend on the topography of vascular lesion and most remarkably sometimes the same topographic region can lead to different clinical syndromes (e.g., dorsal pontine tegmentum). In this report we describe an elderly patient with acute dorsal pontine infarction leading to a unique syndrome of bilateral horizontal gaze palsy and unilateral peripheral facial paralysis. We propose that this syndrome could be included as a part of a continuum that involves one-and-a-half syndrome, eight-and-a-half syndrome, and other variants of pontine tegmentum infarction.
