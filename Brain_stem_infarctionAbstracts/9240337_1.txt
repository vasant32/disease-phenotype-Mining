Vena caval thrombosis has posed a surgical therapeutic challenge for many years. Historically, spiral vein grafts and synthetic materials used as prostheses have had variable results. The use of the stent may serve as a more promising alternative when used in the capacity to relieve caval obstruction. A case is reported in which a young woman with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome has exercise intolerance and associated hypotensive cardiovascular collapse caused by inferior vena caval thrombosis. Recanalization of her inferior vena cava was successfully achieved and subsequently maintained through the placement of two Wallstents across the lesion. Although most venous stenting procedures have thus far been used in the treatment of venous obstruction caused by malignancy, inferior vena cava stenting in this patient with inferior vena caval thrombosis and Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome suggests that venous stenting might offer an alternative therapeutic modality in treating a broader spectrum of occlusive venous disease.
