This case report describes a rare, non-epileptic manifestation of neurocysticercosis where a 22-year-old male presented with acute onset right 3rd nerve palsy with left hemiplegia (Weber syndrome). Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed cysticercus granuloma. The patient improved and became asymptomatic with steroid treatment. Recognizing this clinical entity would avoid unnecessary antituberculous treatment and surgical intervention.
