Multiple arteriovenous malformations involving the left cerebellum and extra-axial posterior fossa with associated calcified cyst, spinal cord, dura, and scalp were present in a 7-year-old girl, who became symptomatic after a cerebellar hemorrhage. A large port-wine stain was noted on the right temporoparietal scalp, consistent with the scalp arteriovenous malformation area, as demonstrated by angiogram. In addition to the multiple arteriovenous malformations, nonfilling of the superior sagittal sinus and tortuous, irregular cortical veins were recognized.
