Dide-Botcazo syndrome (Rev Neurol, 1902) is a unique neuropsychological syndrome, characterized by combinations of cortical blindness, amnesia, and topographical disorientation. We report 82-year-old right-handed man manifesting such syndrome associated with Anton's syndrome after a cardioembolic infarction in the distribution of the bilateral posterior cerebral arteries. The MRI study demonstrated recent extensive infarctions bilaterally in the occipital lobes and the medial temporal lobes, and thalamus. Following the resolution of unconsciousness and tetraparesis, the patient persistently presented with denial of cortical blindness (Anton's syndrome), profound anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia of about 50 years, severe topographical disorientation, and partial impairment of the tactile and auditory naming for objects. The bilateral extensive damages to the visual area, the memory area, and the connecting areas including the occipital lobe of the non-dominant hemisphere possibly responsible for topographical disorientation, may account for producing Dide-Botcazo syndrome. The syndrome may clinically occur following the "top of the basilar" syndrome.
