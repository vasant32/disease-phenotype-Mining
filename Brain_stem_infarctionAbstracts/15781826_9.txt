Eighteen patients underwent stenting for symptomatic basilar artery stenosis. There were three major periprocedural complications (16.7%) without fatality. At a mean 26.7 +/- 12.1-month follow-up, 15 patients (83.3%) had an excellent long-term outcome. Only one patient (5.6%) had moderate disability from recurrent stroke, and two patients died of medical illness at 30 and 36 months after stenting. In this uncontrolled study, stenting appeared to be effective in reducing stroke risk and death and worthy of further scrupulous trial.
