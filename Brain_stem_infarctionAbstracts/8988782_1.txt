Acroangiodermatitis is an unusual cutaneous sequela of chronic venous insufficiency and congenital vascular malformations of the lower extremities. It typically manifests as purple-colored plaques on the extensor surfaces of the toes of the affected limb. Histologically, it closely resembles Kaposi's sarcoma and had thus been named "pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma." This is a report of acroangiodermatitis in a patient with Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome.
