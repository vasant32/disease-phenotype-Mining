Epilepsy presenting early in childhood may be associated with a neurologically devastating clinical course and have significant implications for the child's development. There are limited published data regarding the clinicopathological features of patients who have undergone epilepsy surgery in the first year of life and the role such surgery may have in reducing seizure frequency. This study retrospectively reviews the clinicopathologic features of eight patients from a tertiary care setting who underwent surgery for epilepsy in the first year of life. Eight infants, including seven males and one female, underwent surgery for epilepsy at 3-11 months of age (median 7.5 months). Age at the time of seizure onset ranged from birth to 2 months. Epileptogenic foci were localized by electroencephalographic and radiographic studies to the right side in five patients and left side in three patients. Histopathological findings in excised tissues included cortical dysplasia (n = 7), hemimegalencephaly (n = 3), and Sturge-Weber syndrome (n = 1). Dysplasia was marked by abnormalities in cortical lamination and neuronal orientation (n = 7), neuronal cytomegaly (n = 6), increased molecular layer neurons (n = 5) and balloon cells (n = 2). One patient was known to have epidermal nevus syndrome. Two patients required additional surgery for continued seizures. At last known follow up, all but one patient, who died in the postoperative period, were alive with no or decreased seizures at postoperative intervals of 3-60 months (median 13 months). Surgery can potentially ameliorate epilepsy in patients less than 1 year of age. Most of the patients in this series had cortical dysplasia as the underlying pathology of their epilepsy.
