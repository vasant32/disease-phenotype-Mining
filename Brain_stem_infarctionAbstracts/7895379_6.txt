The results and complications of translabyrinthine and transotic surgery for petrous apex lesions between 1980 and 1992 are presented. An acoustic neuroma was found in 52 patients. In 1988, the translabyrinthine approach was modified into the transotic approach and replaced the former technique. There was no mortality in this series, but two patients had mild brainstem infarcts and there was post-operative bleeding into the cerebellopontine angle in one. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage was seen in six patients and meningitis in two. Three suffered deep vein thrombosis in their legs. There was one case each of herniation of the cerebellum and gastric bleeding. Post-operative facial nerve function was good in 88%, moderate in 10% and poor in 2%. In the case of acoustic neuromas the aim was total tumour removal, but if there was a serious risk of damaging the nerve anatomically, near total or subtotal removal was performed. During the study period, there was a gradual decrease in facial nerve morbidity and surgical complications. This was attributed to increasing experience, the modified wider approach and better post-operative care.
