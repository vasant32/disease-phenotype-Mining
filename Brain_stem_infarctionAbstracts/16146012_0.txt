The paper reports a rare case of an 18-year-old woman with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, whose multi-phase multi-slice CT revealed diffuse colorectal hemangioma. The patient presented symptoms of consumption coagulopathy (Kasabach-Meritt syndrome) and intense collateral circulation in the course of portal hypertension. The CT lesions and possibilities of multiformat and 3D volume rendering reconstructions are presented. To our knowledge, this is the first report of diffuse hemangioma of the colon and rectum in a patient with KTS detected with multi-slice CT.
