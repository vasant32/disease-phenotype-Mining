We reported a case of bilateral cerebellar hemorrhagic infarction in the distribution of the bilateral superior cerebellar artery. A 58-year-old man suddenly developed dizziness and transient loss of consciousness. The neurological examination revealed left hearing disturbance, left sensory disturbance involving face, dysarthria and bilateral ataxia. This patient was considered to be classic clinical syndrome of right superior cerebellar artery. CT and MRI revealed hemorrhagic infarction corresponding to the full territory of the bilateral superior cerebellar artery. The right posterior cerebral artery was filling through the right posterior communicating artery on the right carotid angiography taken 2 hours after the onset. Bilateral vertebral angiography on the 18th day demonstrated no occlusions in the basilar artery and the bilateral superior cerebellar artery. Hemorrhagic infarction corresponding to the full territory of the bilateral superior cerebellar artery, sparing other territories as the present case, is extremely rare. In this case, cerebral embolism (top of the basilar syndrome) was suggested because of existence of atrial fibrillation and sudden onset.
