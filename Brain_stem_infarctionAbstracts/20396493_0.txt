 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Negative findings on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) does not exclude the possibility of brainstem infarction, particularly in the acute stage of medullary lesion. Our aim was to investigate the false-negative rate of DWI in patients with acute lateral medullary infarction. METHODS: We applied DWI to 26 patients with a clinical diagnosis of lateral medullary infarction within 72 h of the onset. We assessed relationships between initial DWI findings and time-to-MRI (the time between onset of symptoms and initial DWI), number of clinical symptoms and signs, and final lesion volume. RESULTS: There were 8 cases (31%) of false negatives in the initial DWI results. The occurrence of false-negative DWI findings decreased significantly as the time-to-MRI increased (P=0.014). However, the false-negative rate was not significantly correlated with the number of clinical symptoms and signs or the final lesion volume. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of lateral medullary infarction should not be ruled out on the basis of early negative DWI. To confirm the lesion, follow-up DWI or further MRI should be performed in cases with early negative DWI results.
