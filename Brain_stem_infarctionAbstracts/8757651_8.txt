We report five cases presenting with soft tissue and bone overgrowth that demonstrate the ability of MRI to establish a diagnosis in the absence of specific clinical features. Disorders included macrodystrophia lipomatosa, angiolipomatosis, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, blue rubber bleb naevus syndrome and one case of segmental limited hypertrophy. The MRI appearances, and other radiological features of these conditions are discussed. MRI is recommended in all cases of macrodystrophy when the clinical features and plain film findings are indeterminate.
