To understand malalignments of the visual axes in one-and-a-half syndrome, we measured eye positions in 4 patients with this syndrome under two conditions: with Frenzel goggles to prevent eye fixation and without Frenzel goggles. When fixation was prevented with the Frenzel goggles, all patients showed mild outward deviation in both eyes. Removal of the Frenzel goggles elicited adduction of the eye ipsilateral to the side of the lesion for fixation, with greater outward deviation of the contralateral eye (acute stage), or adduction of both eyes to midposition for biocular fixation (convalescent stage). In 3 patients whose outward eye deviation with Frenzel goggles was greater on the ipsilateral side, a transition from one-and-a-half syndrome to ipsilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia was noted, whereas a transition to ipsilateral gaze palsy was seen in the one patient whose deviation was greater on the contralateral side. These findings suggest that in one-and-a-half syndrome patients, the eyes tend to be in divergent positions when fixation is prevented; ipsilateral eye deviation may result from medial longitudinal fasciculus involvement, and contralateral eye deviation may result from paramedian pontine reticular formation involvement. Viewing a target may lead to a secondary deviation or adaptation of eye positions for fixation.
