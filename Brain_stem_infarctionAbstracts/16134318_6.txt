We report on the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton MR spectroscopy findings of a 26-year-old female patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Echo-planar trace diffusion MRI revealed mildly high signal intensity changes at parieto-occipital lobes on b = 1000 s/mm2 images, suggesting restricted diffusion. On corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient maps, those areas had moderately high signal intensity and high apparent diffusion coefficient values (around 0.9 x 10(-3) mm2/s) compared with the contralateral symmetrical normal side of the brain (0.776 x 10(-3) mm2/s). This finding was consistent with increased motion of water molecules (disintegration of the neural tissue) in these regions. Proton MR spectroscopy revealed decreased N-acetyl aspartate and increased choline peaks, indicating disintegration of neural tissue associated with neuronal loss as well.
