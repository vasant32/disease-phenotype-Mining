The authors have described case of patient suffering from Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome for many years, after many unsuccessful attempts to treat massive hemorrhages from the nose. This was what made them use maxillary artery embolisation method. It was done using Seldinger technique. Radiologic visualisation of blood vessels was obtained by use of C-arm. The use of this method in that case has been successful so far. According to authors opinion embolisation of maxillary arteries is an effective alternative in treating recurring hemorrhages in patients with Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome.
