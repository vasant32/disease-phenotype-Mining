A rare case of episcleral and orbital varix in a 16-year-old female is reported. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT scan and ultrasonography, and showed during Valsalva's maneuver a typical expansion of the orbital tumor. CT scan showed the tumor to be composed of a plexus of dilated vessels. During Valsalva's maneuver a 10 mm Hg rise in the venous pressure in the episcleral varix was noted, which suggests a direct communication between the episcleral and the orbital varices.
