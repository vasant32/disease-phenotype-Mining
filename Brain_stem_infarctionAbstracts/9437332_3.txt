PURPOSE: To evaluate Sturge-Weber-associated glaucoma using ultrasound biomicroscopy. METHOD: Case report. Clinical examination combined with ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed in a patient with Sturge-Weber-associated glaucoma. RESULTS: In the patient's left eye, which had Sturge-Weber-associated glaucoma, a 360-degree supraciliary effusion, dilated superficial and intrascleral vessels, and an open angle were detected by ultrasound biomicroscopy. CONCLUSION: The presence of dilated intrascleral vessels and supraciliary fluid support the hypothesis of increased episcleral venous pressure as the cause of elevated intraocular pressure in this syndrome.
