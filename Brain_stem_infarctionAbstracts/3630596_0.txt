This report concerns three patients in whom continuous intravenous infusion of Diazemuls (diazepam dissolved in soya bean oil and emulsified) diluted in 5.5% glucose was used for the controlling of epileptic seizures (status). Diazemuls infusion was effective in one patient with complex partial status epilepticus; in another patient with convulsion secondary to a brain stem infarct, the convulsions were abolished; while only reduced jerking was achieved in the third patient suffering from myoclonic jerks caused by anoxic brain damage. Infusion time ranged from 15 to 33 h. The serum concentrations of diazepam obtained during the infusions were higher than recommended in the literature for treatment of status epilepticus, but could not be correlated to either clinical efficacy or infusion rate.
