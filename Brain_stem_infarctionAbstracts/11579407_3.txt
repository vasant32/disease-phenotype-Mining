This report describes the prenatal sonographic diagnosis of a case of Klippel-Tr√©naunay-Weber syndrome. The sonographic appearance of this disorder was characterized by the presence of multiple distorted cystic areas involving the right leg and abdomen and cardiomegaly with early fetal heart failure. Despite the prenatal detection of the extensive cutaneous and visceral involvement, the infant died soon after birth of high-output cardiac failure and Kasabach-Merritt syndrome.
