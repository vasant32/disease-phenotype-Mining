Systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is a complex disease which affects many organ systems. Associated renal lesions are unusual, with the possible exception of amyloidosis. We describe a girl with systemic-onset JRA who developed first membranous nephropathy and then, 3.5 years later, a severe crescentic glomerulonephritis. The membranous lesion followed therapy with intravenous immune globulin, and the possibility that this intervention caused the renal disease must be considered. It appears that both of these lesions should be added to the list of possible complications of systemic-onset JRA.
