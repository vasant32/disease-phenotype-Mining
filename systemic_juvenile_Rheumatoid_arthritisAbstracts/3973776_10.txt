We report two patients with infantile onset of evanescent rash, fever, arthropathy with severe deformities, periosteal changes, chronic meningitis, hydrocephalus, convulsions, developmental delay, papilledema, unusual uveitis, and lymphadenopathy. A few patients with similar findings have been previously reported. Although some similarity exists between findings in these patients and in others with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, they appear to differ both in regard to the nature and severity of the clinical and pathologic features. We suggest that this group of patients has a separate rheumatic disorder not yet included in the standard classifications of the childhood rheumatic diseases.
