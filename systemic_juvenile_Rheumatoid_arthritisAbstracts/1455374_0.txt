The treatment for systemic JRA is among actual problems of pediatric rheumatology. To evaluate the effectiveness of pulse therapy (PT) with methylprednisolone 25-30 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days combined with cyclophosphamide 0.4-0.5 g/sq. m body surface area (BSA) on the 3rd day, repeated quarterly for 12 months, 30 patients with systemic JRA were randomized into 3 groups: 1--those with disease duration (DD) less than 2 years receiving PT (n = 13), 2--with DD 2 years and more (n = 8) receiving PT, and 3--with DD less than 2 years receiving no PT. Children in all 3 groups received concomitant medication (one of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, methotrexate 10 mg/sq. m BSA/week and oral steroids). A rapid and significant improvement, according to systemic and articular manifestations as well as laboratory indices occurred in the 1st group, in most of the measured parameters exceeded effects in the other two groups and gave the opportunity to avoid the administration of oral steroids or to give the lesser initial dose. Side effects were minor and completely reversible.
