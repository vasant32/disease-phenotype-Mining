Serum amyloid A protein (SAA) was isolated from mink and human serum by ultra-centrifugation and gel filtration and characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting followed by autoradiography. SAA was found in similar quantities in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction of serum from a patient suffering from systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and mink stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Only very small quantities were present in normal human controls and not detectable in normal mink. Striking similarities were found in molecular weight, isoelectric point and degree of heterogeneity for human and mink SAA, while immunologic cross-reactivity between the two species was not found. In contrast to human HDL, mink HDL was found not to contain apoA-II and only minute amounts of apoC proteins.
