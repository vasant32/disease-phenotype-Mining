Three children have been presented who have had long-standing, typical systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. They also had a transient illness with thrombocytopenia, antiplatelet antibodies, and the simultaneous appearance of anti-DNA antibodies and hypocomplementemia. Other single abnormalities included the development of a positive ANA, Coombs, and lupus bands test. All responded to high-dose steroid therapy. Their similar clinical and serologic findings are noteworthy and represent one of the numerous complications seen in patients with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
