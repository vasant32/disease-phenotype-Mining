We report a neonate with a rash that appeared on the second day of life in association with elevated body temperatures and increased C-reactive protein levels. The rash was evanescent and recurred on a daily basis during the first year of life. At 15 months, the infant developed swelling of the right knee joint. Early-onset systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can mimic congenital infections and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal exanthemas.
