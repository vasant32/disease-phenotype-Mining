Two cases of spinal cord compression secondary to steroid-induced epidural lipomatosis in systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) patients are reported. This complication of prolonged corticosteroid therapy has not been described previously in children with JRA. Epidural lipomatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of JRA patients receiving high-dose and/or prolonged corticosteroid therapy who present with neurologic signs and symptoms referable to the spinal cord.
