During the last several years, there has been increasing interest in the use of intravenous immune globulin for immunosuppression. Although the mechanism(s) of action remains to be delineated, immune globulin therapy has been shown to be effective in some antibody-mediated disorders. In Rh disease, antibody-induced cytopenias, myasthenia gravis, and the clotting disorder associated with anti-factor VIII antibody, intravenous immune globulin has had therapeutic benefit. It was of interest that intravenous immune globulin may partially ameliorate the tendency toward dilation of the coronary vessels in Kawasaki disease. If this disorder represents a vasculitis of the small feeding vessels of the coronary arteries, could this agent influence other forms of collagen vascular disease? Pilot studies in dermatomyositis and polymyositis and systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis indicate benefit from intravenous immune globulin therapy. In these studies we used a high-dose protocol consisting of 1 gm/kg/day of immune globulin for 2 days every 4 weeks. In patients with either myositis or systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, beneficial effects were seen. In the former group of patients, increased proximal muscle strength and reduction in creatine kinase levels were observed. In the latter group of patients a marked reduction in systemic features was observed. The amount of corticosteroids required was reduced in both groups of patients. These studies indicate the potential for intravenous immune globulin in collagen vascular disorders and the need for carefully controlled trials of this form of therapy.
