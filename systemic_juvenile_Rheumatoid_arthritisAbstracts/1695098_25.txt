Intravenous (IV) gamma globulin has been successfully used as replacement therapy for antibody-deficient patients and, more recently, in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, myasthenia gravis, and Kawasaki disease. In view of the successful treatment of these diseases, we initiated a pilot study of the effect of IV gamma globulin in systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Eight patients with active systemic JRA that was unresponsive to first-line agents, second-line agents, and/or corticosteroids received this therapy monthly for 6 months. Outcome measures included changes in articular and extraarticular features, steroid dosage, and laboratory parameters. Following IV gamma globulin therapy, there was significant improvement in arthritis and/or morning stiffness in 5 of 8 patients, while extraarticular features significantly improved in 7 of 8 patients. At study entry, 6 of 8 patients were receiving prednisone; at study end, prednisone was discontinued in 3 patients and decreased by more than 50% in the other 3. Overall, there was an 80% reduction in the prednisone dosage. Initially, all patients had anemia, low levels of serum albumin, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while a thrombocytosis was seen in 7 of 8 patients. Serum IgG was initially elevated in 6 patients. IV gamma globulin therapy resulted in a significant increase in hemoglobin and albumin levels and a significant decrease in the mean serum IgG level, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In only 1 patient did IV gamma globulin fail to significantly improve the clinical or laboratory features of the disease. We suggest that this therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of systemic JRA.
