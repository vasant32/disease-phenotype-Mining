The study was based on the follow-up of 20 patients with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who received intravenous immunoglobulin. The study comparatively analyzed the efficiency of the therapy alone and in combination with steroids. The immunoglobulin was shown to have positive effects on both articular and extraarticular manifestations of the disease particularly in a group of children untreated with corticosteroids. The duration of the disease did not affect the therapeutical properties of immunoglobulin.
