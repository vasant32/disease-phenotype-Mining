9 children with collagenoses were first treated with AHLG "Dessau" in combination with corticosteroids and then with Imurek (azathioprine). The children seemed to be vitally endangered and suffered from panarteritis, dermatomyositis, polyserositis or corticosteroid-resistent systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. As assessed by decrease of inflammation and clinical symptoms the treatment appeared in one case to be very good and in another good; in four other children it was good for a short period; in three children there was no effect at all. Side effects occurred relatively frequently (thrombocytopenia, anaphylactoid reactions). The justification of an immuno-suppressive treatment together with anti-human-lymphocyte-globulin is discussed in relation to todays knowledge of the pathogenesis of collagenoses and of the mechanisms behind the effects of the AHLG.
