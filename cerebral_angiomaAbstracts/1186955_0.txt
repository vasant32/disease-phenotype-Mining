On the basis of physical laws formulated by Reynolds and Poisseuille the blood flow in the arteries supplying angiomas of cerebral hemispheres was calculated in 22 cases at the time of presence of active vascular anomaly and after its surgical removal. An increase in blood flow in these arteries by 10 to 50% was observed in three-fourths of patients, while in one-fourth this flow decreased by 10--25%. Increased blood flow was observed mainly in angiomas situated in the area of vascularization of the middle cerebral artery, mainly in the sensori-motor area. Decreased blood flow was present usually in patients with raised intracranial pressure and in cases of angioma situated in farther vascularization areas. After the operation the blood flow in corresponding arteries was nearly normal in most cases.
