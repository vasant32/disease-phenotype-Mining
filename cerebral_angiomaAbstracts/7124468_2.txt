Part I of the present paper described the development of a substance for endovascular embolization from homologous fibrinogen, aprotinin, thrombin, metrizamide and CaCl2. Part II deals with the applicability of a controlled-viscosity fibrin mixture via different types of arterial catheters. In a flow-dynamic model the embolizing medium injected via a double syringe was shown to block a blood flow corresponding approximately to the flow encountered in cerebral angioma vessels. In the course of animal experiments the embolization of mesenteric arteries of rabbits showed the distribution of the embolizing medium to be dependent on its viscosity; the action of an embolizing medium applied by means of a double syringe was studied in the femoral arteries of rabbits. Scintigraphy was used to study the distribution of the substance in the body of the experimental animal after intravenous (i.v.) application; long-term studies of embolized auricular arteries in rabbits revealed parchment-like necroses after 5 to 10 days and the presence of radiopaque substances in the ear stumps after 6 weeks.
