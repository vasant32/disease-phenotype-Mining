A case of cerebral angioma: non-invasive assessments. A 65-year-old woman, suffering from epileptic seizures since the age of 6, was examined. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasounds, SEPs and EEG brain mapping by means of median nerve stimulation, were performed, followed by a NMR of the brain, which revealed an arteriovenous malformation in the left hemisphere (frontal and parietal lobe). By comparing the results of the neurophysiological tests, the diagnostic value of TCD, confirmed by the neuroradiologic findings, was established. EEG and SEPs were also abnormal, but their actual effectiveness in clinical studies is discussed. We conclude that these electrophysiological examinations do not allow a reliable diagnosis as with TCD.
