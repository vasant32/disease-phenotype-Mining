A 37-year-old pregnant woman without neurological history was admitted in the 21st week of pregnancy for multiple seizures. Angiography confirmed the diagnosis of cerebral angioma. The patient decided to continue with her pregnancy; caesarean section under regional anesthesia via an epidural catheter was uneventful. Five weeks later the angioma was resected after sudden recurrence of seizures and neurological deterioration. In this report, the therapeutic options for elective neurosurgical intervention after possible termination of pregnancy, during pregnancy, or after delivery are discussed including anesthesiological management during delivery.
