In a patient aged 35 the left cerebral hemisphere was surgically removed for a cerebral angioma. Cerebral function has been examined clinically and from neurophysiologic, neuropsychologic and linguistic aspects. History, pre-and postoperative clinical findings are described. Post-operative motor-activity was registered continuously with 6 electromyograms. It is described, compared with a case of right sided hemispherectomy and discussed. On the basis of a survey of the literature the cerebral activity before and after operation, examined with quantitative EEG analysis, is described and discussed. After a general exposition of the linguistic ability of the right non-dominant hemisphere it is shown that this must have been a case of left dominance. On this assumption the formal-quantitative linguistic findings after left-sided hemispherectomy are described. The neuro-psychologic tests, pre- and post-operatively carried out with several techniques (LPS, HAWIE, FLT, Token-Test), are compared with each other and the results of further tests (a short form of the "Minnesota-test and our own collection of aphasia tests) after hemispherectomy added. After a survey of relevant descriptions in the literature the postoperative linguistic findings (lexic and morphology, syntax, relationship between idea and expressive realization) are described and compared with similar findings in the literature.
