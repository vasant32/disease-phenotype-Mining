The authors describe a rare case of coexistence of cerebral angioma with hyperostosis frontalis interna in a female patient aged 28 years, suffering from mental disturbances. The coexistence of these two diseases in one person caused considerable diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. The described case points out that both these conditions may occur concomitantly. Another point of interest is the presence of hyperostosis frontalis interna in a young woman.
