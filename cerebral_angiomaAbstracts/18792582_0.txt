Arteriovenous cerebral malformations represent congenital malformations. Considering the anatomical characteristics of the cerebral angiomas and their localization, in a great number of cases they demand a combined therapeutic approach--surgery, embolization and radiotherapy. Besides the constant progress of technology, 5% of all cerebral angiomas can not be completely excluded from the circulation. Therefore, the need to understand their natural course became a necessity. Our results point to the fact that they are vascular malformations of a considerably more benign clinical course than the aneurysms. Our clinical model points to an annual risk of hemorrhage which is 3.3% with total mortality of 5.3%, especially if the size of the angioma is 2.5-5 cm, localized in the motor zone of the brain, with combined type of vein drainage and arterial supply from the vertebrobasilary confluence. Epilepsy caused by the cerebral angioma is in 26.7% refractory to medicamentous therapy and in 25% (every 4th patient) will have hemorrhage with an annual risk of 0.14%.
