We report a case of putaminal haemorrhage from a venous cerebral angioma following thrombosis in a draining vein. The patient complained of numbness of the right side, followed by headache and aphasia. CT demonstrated an intracerebral haemorrhage due to thrombotic occlusion of a draining vein of the venous angioma. Carotid angiography showed the venous angioma. MRI studies confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated recanalisation of the draining vein following therapy with phenprocoumon.
