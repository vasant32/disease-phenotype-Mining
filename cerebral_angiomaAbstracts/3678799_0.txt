A case of a ruptured intracranial angioma in the 27th week of pregnancy is presented. The diagnosis was ensured clinico-neurologically by lumbar puncture, cranial computerized tomography and carotid angiography. After neurosurgical intervention and appropriate therapy vaginal delivery occurred despite coma of the patient, in the 36th week of pregnancy. Two days post partum the patient awakened from her coma and was eventually released from hospital after an uneventful puerperium with only slight neurological symptom pattern. Following anticonvulsive therapy because of a grand mal attack, and complete regression of the neurological pattern of signs and symptoms, therapy was discontinued.
