The differential diagnosis of oral ulcerations in a patient with AIDS/HIV infection is often challenging to the clinician. While old diseases have appeared in a new garb, many new ones are also being recognized. The association of Behetaet's disease and AIDS/HIV infection has been recently recognized. We present an HIV-positive patient having oro-genital aphthosis conforming to the diagnostic criteria for Behetaet's disease. Erythema nodosum, periphlebitis, erythematous papulopustular lesions, half and half nails, ocular congestion, raised ESR and dimorphic anemia were some other features present. He had low CD4+/CD8+ counts. He had no other HIV-related disease. He responded well to triple anti-retroviral treatment alone. The possible pathomechanism of the occurrence of both diseases is also discussed.
