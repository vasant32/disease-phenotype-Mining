 PURPOSE: To report results of treatment with a monoclonal antibody (infliximab) directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha in seven patients with chronic and difficult-to-control idiopathic orbital inflammation (orbital myositis). DESIGN: Observational case series. METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from seven patients who had idiopathic orbital inflammation and who were evaluated at three medical centers. All patients were treated with infliximab after the failure of traditional therapy, which included corticosteroids, radiotherapy, or anti-inflammatory chemotherapeutic agents. RESULTS: All seven patients had a favorable response to treatment with infliximab. One patient with Behcet disease required supplemental oral corticosteroids. Pain, swelling, and need for concomitant corticosteroids were the primary measures of treatment success. Symptoms of comorbid disease in four patients also improved (Crohn disease in two, Behcet disease in one, and psoriasis in one). There were no untoward effects of treatment after a mean follow-up of 15.7 months (range, 4 to 31 months). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with infliximab appears to offer another therapeutic option in cases of recalcitrant or recurrent idiopathic orbital inflammation in which conventional treatment fails.
