Neuro-Behçet's disease (NBD) is a serious complication of Behçet's disease. Generally, NBD patients with a chronic course are refractory to immunosuppressive treatment, resulting in the deterioration of personality. In this study, levels of B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 18 patients with NBD, 27 patients with epidemic aseptic meningitis (AM), 24 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 34 healthy controls. BAFF levels in patients with NBD were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls, but showed no statistically significant elevation compared with either of the disease controls. In contrast, CSF IL-6 levels were slightly elevated in patients with NBD and significantly elevated in patients with AM and MS compared with healthy controls. Patients with NBD were subdivided into two groups according to their clinical course (eight patients with a slowly progressive course presenting with psychosis and dementia and 10 patients with an acute course including aseptic meningitis, brainstem involvement and myelopathy). BAFF levels were significantly increased in those with a slowly progressive course compared with those with an acute course. CSF BAFF levels did not correlate with serum BAFF levels, CSF cell counts or CSF IL-6 levels in patients with NBD. These data suggested that BAFF was produced within the central nervous system and may be associated with the development of NBD, particularly with a progressive course.
