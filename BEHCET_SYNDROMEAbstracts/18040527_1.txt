Behcet's disease (BD) is an inflammatory disorder of an unknown cause, but growing evidence indicates that the oxidative stress is increased in BD, owing to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased efficiency of antioxidant defenses. ROS affect proteins and lipids and cause their oxidation, therefore, contributing to the formation of oxidation products: carbonyl, a marker of protein oxidation, and malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation. The investigation was undertaken to evaluate protein oxidation (carbonyl group) levels and lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels, and the role of colchicine and vitamin E therapy on protein carbonyl group and MDA levels in serum samples of patients with BD. In this study, subjects were classified as control group, colchicine therapy group alone and colchicine and vitamin E therapy group. Protein carbonyl and MDA levels at the beginning of the study were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in both therapy groups compared with those of the control group. We found that the protein carbonyl and MDA levels at the end of the study showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences between the therapy groups and control group. These results provide some evidence for a potential effect of colchicine and vitamin E therapies on increased protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in BD.
