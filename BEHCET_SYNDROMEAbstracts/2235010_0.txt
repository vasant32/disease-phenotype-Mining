The involvement of the retina in the inflammation being one important factor in severe uveitis, the authors have tested the "ganzfeld" electroretinogram (ERG) in various forms of uveitis, especially in cases having opaque media. In Fuchs' syndrome and chronic anterior uveitis, the ERG is normal or only slightly altered, while important reduction of the potentials can occur even in case of good vision in intermediate uveitis, probably indicating concomitant retinal vasculitis. In Beh√ßet's disease, ERG is mostly useful in testing the efficacy of therapy. ERG can be rather deceiving in idiopathic vasculitis, where the potentials are not always as reduced as expected. On the contrary, this test seems to allow differential diagnosis between Harada's disease and acute multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy. However, one must bear in mind that concurrent steroid treatment can elevate the amplitude of the potentials, a phenomenon which has to be taken into account when interpreting ERG results.
