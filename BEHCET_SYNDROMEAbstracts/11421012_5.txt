BACKGROUND: The authors studied indocyanine green (ICG) angiographic features in proven cases of ocular Behçet disease. METHODS: Twenty-six patients (18 male, 8 female; mean age 39.9 +/- 8.9 years) with Behçet disease underwent simultaneous ICG and fluorescein angiography (FA) according to a uveitis angiographic standard protocol. Patients were divided into three groups based on their ocular disease duration: Group A (9 patients), less than 3-year duration; Group B (8 patients), 4- to 10-year duration; Group C (9 patients), more than 10-year duration. The relation between ICG angiographic findings and ocular disease duration and FA signs was delimited. RESULTS: Three findings were disclosed by ICG angiography: 1) poorly defined areas of intermediate and late hyperfluorescence (50% of eyes); 2) well-defined hypofluorescent areas becoming isofluorescent in the late phase (26.92% of eyes); and 3) large, poorly defined hypofluorescent areas visible up to the late phase (30.77% of eyes). The presence of ICG hypofluorescent areas up to the late phase was related to disease duration (P = 0.01), whereas ICG hypofluorescent areas becoming isofluorescent in the late phase were predominant in patients in early stages of ocular disease (P = 0.02). The presence or absence of FA signs did not indicate any significant correlation with the presence or absence of signs revealed by ICG angiography. CONCLUSION: Indocyanine green angiography enabled the identification of different choroidal abnormalities related to the ocular disease duration. The presence of some ICG findings undetectable with FA suggests that ICG and FA are complementary means to diagnose and monitor ocular vascular involvement in patients with Behçet disease.
