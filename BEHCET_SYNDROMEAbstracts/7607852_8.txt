Soluble interleukin 2 receptor (SIL-2R) and interleukin 1-B (IL-1B) levels in peripheral blood were assayed by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent method in 25 patients with Behçet's disease and in 20 healthy controls. Eighteen patients suffered from active Behçet's disease and 6 patients had severe disease manifestations. SIL-2R levels were followed for a period of 16 months and were correlated with disease activity. In all the patients with Behçet's disease the levels of SIL-2R and IL-1B were significantly higher than their control, 958 +/- 712 vs. 404 +/- 119 u/ml (P < 0.001) for SIL-2R and 639 +/- 741 vs. 59 +/- 53 pg/ml (P < 0.001) for IL-1B. No correlation was found between disease activity and severity and the levels of SIL-2R and IL-1B. It is suggested that levels of SIL-2R and IL-1B are elevated in patients with Behçet's disease but do not serve as disease activity markers.
