We describe two cases, a 28-year-old woman and a 46-year-old man, with mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage (chondritis of the nose and ears) (MAGIC syndrome). The conditions of both patients were resolved by treatment with corticosteroid and colchicine. We also review the English literature related to this rare syndrome.
