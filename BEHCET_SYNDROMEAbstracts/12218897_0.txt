Pulmonary involvement in Behçet's disease is an uncommon condition (12%). Thromboembolism of the superior vena cava and/or other mediastinal veins, aneurysms of the aorta and pulmonary arteries are the main vascular manifestations in addition to pulmonary infarct and intrathoracic hemorrhage. Despite their scarcity, respiratory symptoms may be life-threatening. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of thoracic imaging for one of the most serious aspects of the disease: pulmonary artery aneurysm. We report five patients with pulmonary artery aneurysms (mean age: 39.5 years). Hemoptysia revealed Behçet's disease in three. Initially explored by conventional radiography, computed tomography and angiography, pulmonary artery aneurysms are currently investigated well with helicoidal computed tomography, digital angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angio-MRI. These imaging techniques provide helpful information for the diagnosis of Behçet's disease.
