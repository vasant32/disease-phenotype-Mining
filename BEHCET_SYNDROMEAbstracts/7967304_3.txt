We reported three cases of neurogenic bladder due to neuro-Beçhet disease. Case 1 (24-year-old male) and case 3 (54-year-old male) had complaint of urinary frequency and urinary incontinence. Case 2 (35-year-old male) had a complaint of urinary retention. Uro-dynamic study were performed repeatedly in each case. Two cases showed overative detrusor activity in storage phase and normal or hypo detrusor activity in voiding phase. One case (case 2) showed normal detrusor activity in storage phase and acontractile in voiding phase. All cases showed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). All cases were managed with clean intermittent catheterization. Six months later case 2 complained of urge incontinence. Repeated uro-dynamic study revealed that bladder function changed from normal detrusor to overactive detrusor in storage phase. These findings suggest that neurogenic bladder due to neuro-Beçhet disease is characterized uro-dynamical by overactive detrusor in storage phase and DSD in voiding phase.
