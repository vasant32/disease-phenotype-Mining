 BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a chronic, multi-systemic autoimmune disease. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) gene is one of non-human leucocyte antigen genes. It has been demonstrated to be associated with several autoimmune diseases. However, only a few studies have addressed the association of ligand genes of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 with autoimmune disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze the potential association of the PD-1 and its ligand genes with Behcet's disease in a Chinese Han population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) rs2227981 and rs10204525 of PD-1, rs1970000 of PD-L1 and rs7854303 of PD-L2 were genotyped in 405 Behcet's patients and 414 age-, sex-, ethnic-matched healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The results revealed that there were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of PD-1 rs2227981 and rs10204525 between the Behcet's patients and controls. A similar result was found for PD-L1 rs1970000 versus healthy controls. Only the C allele and the CC genotype of PD-L2 rs7854303 were identified in patients and controls. Stratification analysis based on gender and clinical findings did not show any associations between PD-1 or its ligand polymorphisms and Behcet's disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: None of the currently studied SNPs, PD-1 rs2227981 and rs10204525, PD-L1 rs1970000 and PD-L2 rs7854303, are associated with the susceptibility to Behcet's disease in a Chinese Han population. More studies are needed to confirm these findings in Behcet's patients with other ethnic backgrounds.
