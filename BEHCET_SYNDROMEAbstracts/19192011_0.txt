A woman with oculocutaneous Beh√ßet disease developed primary tuberculosis while being treated with infliximab. A latent tuberculosis infection had been excluded before therapy. After more than 80 weeks of treatment, the patient complained of fevers, night sweats, shivering and vigorous cough. The chest x-ray showed miliary shadowing. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified. The history revealed recent contact to an individual with smear-positive tuberculosis. This constellation speaks in favor of a de novo tuberculosis infection with a fulminant course.
