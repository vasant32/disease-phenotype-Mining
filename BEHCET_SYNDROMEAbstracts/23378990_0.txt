Multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and Behcet disease (BD) are chronic, immune-mediated disorders affecting young adults, the pathogenesis of which is still largely unknown. MS and other demyelinating processes are sometimes difficult to differentiate from the CNS involvement in systemic rheumatic diseases (SRD). An acute isolated neurological syndrome presents the greatest diagnostic problem, since it is common not only in MS, but can also be the only feature or first manifestation in SLE, APS, SS, and BD. Neurological manifestations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be indistinguishable and no specific diagnostic tools are available.
