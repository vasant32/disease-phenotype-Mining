We present a case report of a patient suffering from Behet's syndrome with pulmonary involvement. The development of endobronchial granulomatosis in the bronchus intermedius and right upper lobe bronchus led to severe bronchial stenosis and dyspnoea. Also aphthous ulcerations in the bronchial mucosa occurred. Treatment of the granulomatous stenosis consisted of Neodym-YAG laser resection and immunosuppression. On follow-up there was a recurrence of the stenosis, characterised by fibrotic strictures. Therefore a balloon dilation was performed and immunosuppression instituted, which led to an increase in airway diameter and a reduction in dyspnoea. These clinical results suggest that recanalisation therapy with Neodym-YAG laser and/or balloon dilation with additional immunosuppression is suitable in benign stenosis (granulomatous or fibrotic), caused by Behet's disease.
