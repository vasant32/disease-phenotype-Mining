A 45-year-old man complained of fever and bloody sputum. Chest X-ray films showed a round opacity in the left hilum. He developed massive hemoptysis (500 ml) and emergency embolization of the bronchial artery was performed. Pulmonary artery aneurysm and thrombosis were detected angiographically, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a reddish irregular eminence of the left main bronchus and lingulate++ ++ bronchus. These sites could have been the bleeding sites. Because of recurrent hemoptysis, left pneumonectomy was performed 26 days after the massive hemoptysis. Pathological findings showed panarteritis, luminal thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery and markedly dilated vessels of the bronchial wall. He developed genital ulceration after the operation and these findings suggested incomplete vasculo-Beh√ßet's disease with rare pulmonary involvement. The disease is now well-controlled by corticosteroid therapy 27 months after the operation.
