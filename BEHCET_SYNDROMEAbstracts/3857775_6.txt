Cyclosporin A was used in nine patients with severe refractory posterior uveitis. Four patients had Behcet's disease, one had sarcoidosis, one had HLA B27 related arthritis and uveitis and three had idiopathic retinal vasculitis. The drug had beneficial ocular effects in all patients in the early stages of treatment with an improvement in the visual acuity and reduction in the severity of inflammation. The relapse rate and need for additional steroids were reduced in all patients. However, renal function deteriorated in seven patients to such an extent that the dose of Cyclosporin A had to be reduced with consequent relapse of uveitis.
