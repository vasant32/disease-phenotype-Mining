Four patients affected with Beh√ßet's disease were studied during the past year. Clinical manifestations were varied; besides the classical triad, they included axillary-subclavian thrombophlebitis, electrocardiographic changes, sacroillitis and polyarthritis. The HLA was determined in all patients and it was possible to demonstrate the relationship between HLA-B27 antigen and articular manifestations, HLA-B12 and urogenital ulcers and HLA-B5 with ocular lesions. Treatment with colchicine induced total remission within one month in all four patients, and was longer lasting than remissions which were either spontaneous or induced with other therapies. Pathogenic theories on which treatment was based are discussed.
