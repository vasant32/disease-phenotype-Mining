Vascular involvement is a well known manifestation of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and may effect systemic and regional circulation in patients with BD. We evaluated ophthalmic and central retinal artery flow velocities in these patients. Mean ophthalmic and central retinal artery flow velocities were lower in patients with BD than in healthy controls, but the cause and significance of these findings remain to be defined.
