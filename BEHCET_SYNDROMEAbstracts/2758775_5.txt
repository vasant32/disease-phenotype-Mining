A high incidence of anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 7 of 20 patients (35%) with Beh√ßet's Syndrome. Three patients had IgG-ab, three had IgM-ab and one had both IgG and IgM antibodies. IgG-ACA was detected mainly in patients with ocular disease (30%) and one of them also has cerebral vascular disease. A lower incidence of ACA was found in the patients taking steroids compared with the ones taking other drugs. This work draws attention to the more severe disease present in patients with ACA and also the possibility of such tests become negative in patients taking immunosuppressive drugs.
