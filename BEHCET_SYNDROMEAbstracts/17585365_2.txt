We report a 19-year-old woman with Behcet's disease who suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage and had bilateral peripheral middle cerebral artery aneurysms. After steroid therapy for 3 days, the smaller aneurysm disappeared. The larger aneurysm was excised and the artery reconstructed using a superficial temporary artery graft. Histological examination showed vasculitis restricted to the wall of the aneurysm. This is the first report of arterial reconstruction for an aneurysm associated with Behcet's disease. Steroid therapy before the operation may facilitate repair of the arterial wall.
