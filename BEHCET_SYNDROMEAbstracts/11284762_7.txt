PURPOSE: To investigate effects of vitreoretinal surgery in Behçet's disease. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Vitreoretinal surgery was applied to 26 eyes of 21 patients with Behçet's disease. Preoperative and postoperative visual acuities, number and duration of attacks, anterior and posterior segment pathologies were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 33 years and female/male ratio was 6/15. The mean follow-up was 23 months. Visual acuity increased in 15 eyes (58%), did not change in 11 eyes (42%). In the postoperative period, there was a significant decrease in mean number of uveitis attacks compared to the preoperative period (p=0.001), as well as a significant decrease in the mean duration of uveitis attacks (p=0.001). In the postoperative follow-up, intravitreal haemorrhage in 2 eyes (8%), posterior subcapsular cataract in 5 eyes (19%) and corticonuclear cataract in 2 eyes (8%) were observed. Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) developed in 5 of 16 eyes (31%) having ECLE-IOL. CME continued in 3 eyes (12%). CONCLUSION: Vitreoretinal surgery has favourable effect on the visual and anatomic prognosis in Behçet's patients with severe ocular complications.
