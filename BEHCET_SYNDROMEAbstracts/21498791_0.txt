Pseudotumor cerebri with or without venous sinus thrombosis is a rare clinical presentation of Behçet disease in childhood. We present here a case of childhood pseudotumor cerebri without a previous diagnosis of Behçet disease. The detailed history and physical examination of the case led to the diagnosis of neuro-Behçet disease. The investigation of predisposition to thrombosis revealed heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation along with the high lipoprotein(a) level. The symptoms resolved dramatically by treatment with the combination of immunosuppression and anticoagulation with regard to the detected factor V Leiden mutation and high lipoprotein(a) level. After a symptom-free period of 9 months, the cerebral vein thrombosis recurred. We present this case to draw attention to this rare cause of pseudotumor cerebri in childhood and to emphasize the importance of additional thrombotic risk factors regarding the potential recurrence of thrombotic events in Behçet disease.
