A rare case of hemolytic anemia complicated with Behçet's disease and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is described. A 41-year old woman suffering from hemolytic anemia was admitted in July of 1988 with right lower abdominal pain and a high fever. Her anemia was first pointed out in 1962 (at age 15), and diagnosed as hemolytic anemia in 1977 by a full hematological examination showing erythro-hyperplasia in bone marrow, Coomb's test was negative and corticosteroid therapy failed to improve her anemia. She had also been suffering from recurrent stomatitis and genital ulcer since the delivery of her first baby in July, 1972. Barium enema was performed and revealed a simple deep ulcer at the terminal ileum. Bone marrow examination showed morphological abnormalities of granulocytic and erythrocytic series. We thereby diagnosed her illness as incomplete Behçet's disease and MDS associated with hemolytic anemia. She was treated by ubenimex, blood transfusion and intravenous alimentation with discontinuing oral intake, and there was a satisfactory improvement in pancytopenia and ulcer.
