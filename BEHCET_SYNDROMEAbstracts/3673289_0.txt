Behçet's syndrome represents a multisystemic disease with vasculitic changes. It manifests mainly with oral and genital ulceration, ocular involvement mostly uveitis and typical skin lesions. Further symptoms can develop: arthritis, gastrointestinal signs, thrombophlebitis and neurologic disturbances. The disease can start already in childhood and follows a chronic recurrent course. Diagnosis is often delayed by a long interval between manifestation of each of the several symptoms. In this regard diagnostic criteria which consider clinical findings have proved helpful. Courses of Behçet's syndrome in three juvenile patients whose disease started in childhood are demonstrated and discussed together with experience from the literature.
