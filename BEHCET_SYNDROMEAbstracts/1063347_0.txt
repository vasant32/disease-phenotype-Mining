The literature on Behçet's syndrome is reviewed and four cases are presented. Two of the patients were men and two were women. The age at presentation varied from 21 to 55 years. All patients had the first manifestations of the disease before the age of 25 and two before the age of 10. None presented with the complete triad of symptoms. All four had oral ulceration and either ocular lesions (two cases) or lesions on the genitals (two cases). According to the present theories, the diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome is established by the presence of any two of the triad of symptoms. We suggest that in order to be classified as having Behçet's syndrome, a patient should have oral lesions and either genital and/or ocular ulcerations.
