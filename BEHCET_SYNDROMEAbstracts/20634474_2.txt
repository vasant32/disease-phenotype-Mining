 OBJECTIVE: Behçet disease (BD) is a vasculitis of unknown etiology, characterized by oral or genital aphtosis and uveitis. Homocysteine (hcy) is an independent risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis. The association between hyperhomocysteinemia and thrombosis has been investigated in some studies in BD patients. However, information on this association is based only on the results of small studies with conflicting results. To overcome such limitations, we performed a metaanalysis comparing the plasma levels of hcy in BD patients with and without history of thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched for all published studies using the Medline and Embase databases. Two reviewers performed study selection independently. Studies were included if hcy was measured in adult BD patients with and without thrombosis. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study and population characteristics. The mean value of hcy in BD patients and the presence of hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with and without thrombosis were collected. Association between thrombosis and hyperhomocysteinemia, and the mean difference of hcy levels in BD patients with and without thrombosis were calculated. Sixteen studies, for a total of 979 patients, were included. Hyperhomocysteinemia was more prevalent in patients with thrombosis than in those without (odds ratio 3.14; 95% CI 1.26 to 7.80) Mean levels of hcy were significantly higher in patients with thrombosis in comparison with patients without (mean difference 3.30 μmol/L; 95% CI 2.09 to 4.51). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hyperhomocysteinemia may be considered to be associated with thrombosis in BD patients.
