 PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of secondary glaucoma in Behcet disease. METHODS: A total of 230 eyes of 129 patients with Behcet disease, were examined in uveitis and glaucoma clinics of Ankara Social Security Eye Hospital between January 1997 and September 2002. The data from all patients were investigated both retrospectively and prospectively. RESULTS: The mean age of 129 patients was 34.2 +/- 7.4 years (range, 18 to 55 years). In 22 patients (17%), the disease was diagnosed on the basis of the ocular findings, while in the remaining 107 patients (83%), the period between the diagnosis of Behcet disease and the onset of the ocular symptoms was 23.3 +/- 17 months (range, 1 month to 5.3 years); 122 eyes (53%) had the episodes of acute recurrent iridocyclitis, while 108 eyes (47%) developed chronic posterior uveitis, including vitreitis, retinitis, vasculitis, or optic nerve involvement. Secondary glaucoma was diagnosed in 25 eyes (10.9%); 11 eyes (44%) with steroid or inflammation induced open angle glaucoma, 6 eyes (24%) with partial angle-closure glaucoma and peripheral anterior synechiae, 5 eyes (20%) with angle closure glaucoma, peripheral anterior synechiae, and pupil block and 3 eyes (12%) with neovascular glaucoma. The treatments included YAG-laser iridotomy in 5 eyes, diode-laser cyclodestruction in 3 eyes, primary trabeculectomies with mitomycin-c in 4 eyes, secondary trabeculectomies with mitomycin-c in 2 eyes, Ahmed valve implantations in 2 eyes, and cyclocryotherapy in 3 eyes. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that secondary glaucoma is a common and serious complication of Behcet disease. It develops as a result of multiple factors, generally triggered by recurrent intraocular inflammation. Early recognition and treatment of these factors have vital importance to avoid the visual morbidity.
