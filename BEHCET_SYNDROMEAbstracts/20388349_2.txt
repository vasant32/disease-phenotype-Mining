 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of etanercept for recurrent Behcet disease (BD). METHODS: Retrospective review of 12 recurrent BD uveitis patients (16 eyes) who were followed up in Department of Ophthalmology and Department of Rheumatology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital during April 2007 to June 2008 and received etanercept for treatment of uveitis. On the basis of conventional corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, subcutaneous injection of 25 mg etanercept twice per week was instituted initially, followed by a tapering to once per week based on efficacy and economic consideration. Complete ocular examination including visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior segment and fundus conditions were well documented at base line and at each visit. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, ocular B ultrasound were conducted when necessary. Endpoint of observation: substantial improvement of ocular inflammation or etanercept treatment was stopped for various reasons. RESULTS: Of 12 patients, 9 had shown improvement on visual acuity at least in one eye, although 3 of them did not show improvement. At end point, as compared to base line, of 16 eyes, 10 (63%) had better visual acuity, 6 (37%) had the same visual acuity, and none decreased; substantial improvement or remission of both anterior and posterior segment inflammation were observed for all patients. No serious adverse reaction was observed during follow up. CONCLUSION: On the basis of corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, etanercept has good short term efficacy and safety for recurrent BD uveitis.
