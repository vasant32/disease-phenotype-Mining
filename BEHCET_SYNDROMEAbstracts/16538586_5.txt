We herein report a case of hemobilia caused by a hepatic artery aneurysm. A 40-year-old male patient with a history of Behçet's disease with a thrombus hanging out of the papilla of Vater had a large hepatic aneurysm in angiography. The hepatic artery feeding the aneurysm was embolized. Endovascular treatment can treat patients with hepatic artery aneurysms caused by Behçet's disease.
