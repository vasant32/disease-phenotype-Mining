In a prospective study of 150 patients with Beh√ßet's disease, significant associations were shown between CRP positivity and the presence of erythema nodosum (p less than 0.02) and acute thrombophlebitis (p less than 0.05) and between ESR and erythema nodosum (p less than 0.01), acute thrombophlebitis (p less than 0.001), and acute arthritis (p less than 0.01). Mucocutaneous, ocular, or central nervous system activities did not show significant associations with these indices of inflammation. In 50 patients in whom quantitative CRP determinations were performed, clinical disease activity was accompanied by slight to moderate increases in CRP and ESR.
