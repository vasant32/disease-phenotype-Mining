A 40-year-old man presented with a single, major ulcer in the hypopharynx. Histopathological examination revealed necrosis and extensive vasculitis. Since the patient had recurrent oral ulcers and genital ulcers in his history and a positive pathergy test, a diagnosis of Behçet's disease was made, according to the 1992 international criteria. Behçet's disease should be kept in mind in differential diagnoses of hypopharyngeal ulcerous lesions, and detailed case histories should be taken.
