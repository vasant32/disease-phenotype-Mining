Optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease is rare, despite wide ocular and neurological involvement. Progressive atrophy of the optic disc and severe visual loss is not uncommon in Behçet's disease; however, visual loss due to acute optic neuropathy is less well known. We report three cases of optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease. The clinical picture was variable in our patients, presenting either as acute retrobulbar optic neuritis or anterior optic neuropathy. It is interesting to note that although the neurological picture resembles multiple sclerosis, there seems to be less predilection to optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease.
