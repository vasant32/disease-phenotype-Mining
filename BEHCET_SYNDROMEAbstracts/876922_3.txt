A case of Behçet's syndrome with mucosal ulcerations of the ascending colon and three perforations of the caecum is described. It is the first documented case of this syndrome where colitis has occurred without concomitant rectal lesions. The reported cases of Behçet's syndrome with associated colonic lesions make up a heterogeneous group. It is suggested that the different patients may have suffered from pathogenetically different diseases.
