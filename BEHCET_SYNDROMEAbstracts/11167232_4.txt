PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in patients with Behçet's disease. METHODS: Retrospective study was based on 19 uveitic eyes of 12 patients with Behçet's disease who underwent classic ECCE with IOL implantation in 5 eyes and phacoemulsification with IOL implantation in 14 eyes between 1993-1999. RESULTS: In eyes with Behçet's uveitis 0.5 or better postoperative visual acuity was found in 21% at the end of mean 34.2-4.6 (range 5 to 66) months follow-up. The most frequent postoperative complications were posterior capsule opacification in 9 (47%), posterior synechiae in 5 (26%), anterior synechiae in 3 (16%). Anterior and posterior synechiae in the phacoemulsification group were less than those in the ECCE group (respectively p<0.05 and p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In eyes with chronic Behçet's uveitis, cataract extraction and IOL implantation by phacoemulsification had fewer postoperative complication than ECCE, but most of the patients had low visual acuity due to preoperatively existing optic atrophy and/or inflammatory degeneration or edema of macula.
