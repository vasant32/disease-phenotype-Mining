The serial EEGs on 10 cases of neuro-Behcet's syndrome have been investigated and were compared with the clinical symptomatology and autopsy findings in 4 cases. In 8 cases, the EEGs showed a mild to moderate increase in slowed alpha and theta waves and in 5 cases diffuse alpha patterns. In 2 cases, large slow wave patterns were observed and in Case 10, large slow waves changed into low voltage fast dominant patterns following the status epilepticus. In all the cases, the EEG changes seemed to be well correlated with the clinical symptoms. Our present study suggested that the diffuse alpha patterns were only seen in cases with the least affected brain stem diffuse projection system. From the investigation of the sequential alterations of large slow waves in Case 10, it was suggested that a synchronization mechanism would lie in the medulla oblongata.
