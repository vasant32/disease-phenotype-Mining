 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate serum paraoxonase (PON1) activity in relation to homocysteine, malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid parameters in active and inactive Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: A total of 46 consecutive BD patients and 25 healthy control subjects were included in the present study. RESULTS: Serum PON1 activity in both active and inactive BD was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (p<0.05). When compared to the control group, serum MDA levels were significantly higher in both active and inactive BD (p<0.05). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher in active BD than those in inactive BD and control subjects (p<0.05). In addition, there was significant negative correlation between serum PON1 and MDA levels (r=-0.697, p<0.05) and serum PON1 activity was also negatively correlated with homocysteine levels (r=-0.428, p<0.05) in BD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PON1 could explain the increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress observed in BD. Also, according to our results, we suggest that homocysteine may contribute to decreased serum PON1 activity.
