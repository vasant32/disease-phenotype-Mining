The patient was a 37-year-old female with incomplete form of Behçet's disease combined with aortic valve regurgitation. The patients with Behçet's disease often have perivalvular leakage after valve replacement. Special technique is necessary in order to reinforce suture lines and minimize the occurrence of postoperative perivalvular leakage. The aortic valve replacement was accomplished by bolstering mattress sutures with Teflon felt strips and by inserting of sutures from outside the aorta. The latter technique was utilized around the entire circumference of the aortic annulus by opening the right ventricular outflow tract and right atrium and passing sutures from within these structures to enter the aorta. Satisfactory result was obtained with no findings of perivalvular leakage 2 years after operation. The conductive system was not damaged. The operation was performed when the inflammatory signs and findings subsided with adrenal steroids. The steroid therapy has been continued and adjusted by the values of CRP as well as the cutaneous and mucous manifestations.
