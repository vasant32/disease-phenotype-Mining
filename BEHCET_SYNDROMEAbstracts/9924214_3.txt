OBJECTIVE: Changes in blood rheology, especially increased erythrocyte aggregation (EA) might play an important part in the development of arterial and venous thrombotic lesions. A prospective study was designed to evaluate EA in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and to see if this parameter is predictive for the future development of vascular complications, such as deep vein thrombosis of various organ systems and uveitis. METHODS: EA was measured by a photometric Myrenne aggregometer in 38 patients with BD at the time of initial diagnosis and in 40 age and sex matched healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: During a median follow up period of 13.5 months, 13 patients developed vascular-ocular complications (eight deep vein thrombosis, nine uveitis, and four both deep vein thrombosis and uveitis). Patients were further divided into two groups: BD-a with mucocutaneous symptoms and arthritis only; BD-b with associated vascular-ocular complications. EA values at high shear rate (M) and at low shear rate (M1) were compared among the groups. CONCLUSION: EA values at M and M1 were significantly higher in BD-b than BD-a and HC (p < 0.001). These results suggest that determination of EA rates might be useful to identify subgroups who are likely candidates for developing vascular-ocular complications in BD and management of factors known to affect blood rheology might be beneficial.
