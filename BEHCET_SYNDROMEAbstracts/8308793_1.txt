A 51-year-old male patient with Behçet's disease had a large echogenic mass in the left atrium mimicking myxoma, documented by echocardiography. Postoperative pathological examination revealed left atrial thrombus, deep ulcerations of mitral valve leaflets with signs of active endocarditis. Cardiac evaluation with echocardiography should be considered in patients with Behçet's disease.
