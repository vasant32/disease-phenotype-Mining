Behçet's disease (BD) is associated with an increased thrombotic risk, although the prothrombotic mechanisms are not clearly defined. Alterations in blood rheology, specially increased erythrocyte aggregation has been suggested to play an important role in the development of thrombotic events in patients with Behçet's disease. In order to ascertain whether any rheological parameter could be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in Behçet's disease we have determined plasmatic lipids, fibrinogen, hematocrit, erythrocyte aggregation (Myrenne aggregometer), erythrocyte deformability (Rheodyn SSD), blood viscosity (Brookfield viscosimeter), plasma viscosity (Fresenius capillary viscosimeter) and erythrocyte indexes in Behçet's patients with a non-active disease when sampling, and a well matched control group. The patient group was made up of 40 Behçet's patients (20 male, 20 female aged 43+/-12 years) and the control group comprised 70 healthy volunteers (24 male, 46 female aged 45+/-13 years). Twelve of the 40 Behçet's patients have had a previous documented history of deep vein thrombosis at least six months before entering the study, and the other 28 did not. When patients and controls were compared, patients showed a statistically higher fibrinogen level (p=0.002), plasma viscosity (p=0.003), blood viscosity (p=0.021) and erythrocyte aggregation (p=0.049), the other rheological parameters not being statistically significant. No differences were observed in the rheological parameters when patients with and without a previous thrombotic episode were compared. Our results suggest that rheological alterations do not seem to play any role in the development of thrombotic events in patients with Behçet's disease.
