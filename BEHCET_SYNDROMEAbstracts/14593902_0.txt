Chronic infections that caused by hepatitis B and C viruses, are important all of the world as a public health problem. Despite intensive control measurements, the incidences of chronic hepatitis B and C virus infections in our country are estimated as 5-7% and 3%, respectively. There are accumulating data of especially autoimmune mediated extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis B and C virus infections, such as Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Beh√ßet's Disease (BD), hypo- or hyper-thyroiditis and autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was the retrospective evaluation of 400 chronic B hepatitis (CBH) and 35 C hepatitis (CCH) patients by means of the presence of extrahepatic manifestations. As a result, the positivity rates of extrahepatic manifestations detected in CBH and CCH patients were as follows respectively; 1.5% and 8.5% for DM, 1.5% and 5.7% for hypothyroiditis, 0.75% and 2.8% for hyperthyroiditis, 2% and 20% for nodular goitre, 0.25% and 5.7% for BD, 1% and 0% for systemic lupus, 1% and 5.7% for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and 22% and 11.4% for iron deficiency anemia. DM, thyroid diseases and RA were the most common extrahepatic manifestations detected in both of the patient groups, while the rates of DM, BD and nodular goitre were found higher in CCH patients than CBH patients (p < 0.05). As a result, the extrahepatic manifestations should be carefully followed in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C infections, for an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
