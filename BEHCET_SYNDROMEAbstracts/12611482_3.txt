Recent studies of the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in Behçet's disease have shown contradicting results. The aim of the present study was to investigate the serum homocysteine level in patients diagnosed as having Behçet's disease. Venous blood was taken from 27 patients with Behçet's disease and 21 healthy controls. Serum homocysteine levels were measured using fluorescence polarization immunoassay. In addition, serum vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. The mean levels of vitamin B12, folic acid, and homocysteine were not significantly different in patients with Behçet's disease when compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.17, p = 0.13, and p = 0.05, respectively). The results of this study confirmed that homocysteine levels were not elevated in Behçet's disease when compared with the control group. Further studies in a subset of Behçet patients with a history of thrombosis are needed to determine the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the thrombotic form of the disease.
