 AIM: To compare the topographic characteristics of the optic discs in patients with severe and mild ocular Beh√ßet's disease by using Heidelberg retinal tomographaphy (HRT). METHODS: This prospective study included 47 eyes of 47 patients with ocular BD who were being followed-up at the Uveitis Clinic of the Ankara Ulucanlar Eye Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 21 eyes with mild uveitis, and group 2 consisted of 26 eyes with severe uveitis. All patients underwent topographic optic disc analysis by HRT II, and the quantitative optic disc parameters of both groups were compared by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The mean cup volume, rim volume, cup area, disc area and cup depth in group 1 were found to be statistically significantly greater than those in group 2 (p<0.0001, p = 0.03, p = 0.021, p = 0.01 and p = 0.017, respectively), while the difference between the mean cup-to-disc ratios in group 1 and group 2 were found to be statistically insignificant (p = 0.148). CONCLUSION: A relationship was found between the severity of ocular BD and optic disc topography determined by HRT. In eyes with smaller optic discs, uveitis was observed to have a more severe course with more frequent relapses than those with larger discs.
