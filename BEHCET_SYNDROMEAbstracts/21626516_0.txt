Splenosis is the autotransplantation of splenic tissue resulting from the dissemination of cells from the pulp of the spleen after splenic injury or splenectomy. Implants can be found anywhere in the peritoneal cavity, especially on the serosal surfaces of small and large bowel, in the mesentery and diaphragm, implanted in visceral organs, within the thorax and brain, and in surgical scars and may vary in number, shape, and size. We described the sonographic, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of pararectal splenosis in a 23-year-old man. The lesions appeared as multiple, well-circumscribed, small, round, homogenously solid masses of different sizes at the retrovesical and pelvic region detected during the imaging workup of Beh√ßet disease.
