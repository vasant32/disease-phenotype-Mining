Sixteen patients with different types of uveitis (ocular toxoplasmosis, chronic cyclitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, Beh√ßet's syndrome, ocular herpes, and a probable nematode) had the aqueous humor withdrawn and had the number of T, B, and null lymphocytes assessed. T and B lymphocytes were identified by rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes and with human erythrocytes sensitized with IgM antibody and complement or zymosan-C3 complexes, respectively. A much higher number of T lymphocytes than B lymphocytes was observed in all cases. The results were not influenced by treatment with steroids or immunosuppressive drugs for local, periocular, or systemic effects.
