Chemokines are important determinants of the early inflammatory response. The CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) Delta32 variant results in a non-functional form of the chemokine receptor, and has been implicated in a variety of immune-mediated diseases. To investigate its role in the pathogenesis of Beh√ßet's disease, we studied 350 patients and 519 healthy controls from three ethnic groups. While significant inter-ethnic variation in allele frequency was observed, no association was identified with disease, even when data were stratified by the known susceptibility gene HLA-B*51.
