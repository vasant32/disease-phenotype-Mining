Gamcho-Sasim-Tang (GS-Tang) is a traditional Chinese medication, which has been successfully used in Korea for the treatment of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease (ABD). We investigated the modulation effects of GS-Tang on cytokine production from phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Behçet's patients. ABD is a systemic inflammatory disorder and might involve immune dysfunction. Cytokines involved in the regulation of inflammatory reactions and immune responses may play a role in the pathogenesis of ABD. GS-Tang (1 mg/ml) significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), compared to absence of GS-Tang (by 42.0+/-6.6% inhibition for TNF-alpha and 95.9+/-5.7% for IL-1 beta, P<0.05). GS-Tang also inhibited the production of IFN-gamma, immunoregulatory T helper cell type 1 cytokine, by 80.2+/-5.3% (P=0.001). The inhibitory effects of GS-Tang on cytokine production showed dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that GS-Tang might have anti-inflammatory and immuno-regulatory effects through the cytokine modulation.
