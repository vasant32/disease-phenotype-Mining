We analyzed the charts of 25 patients with arterial lesion in Beh√ßet's disease with mean follow-up 76 months. We conclude that prognosis is poor. Corticosteroids and surgery if possible is needed, anti-aggregant or anticoagulants and prosthetic rather than venous graft are suitable. This therapy does not exclude the risk of relapse. Immunosuppressive drugs in addition to corticosteroids seem to be more efficient than corticosteroids alone but the therapeutic modalities need to be define.
