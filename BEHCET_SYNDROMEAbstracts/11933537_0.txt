Vascular involvement in Behcet's disease is common, especially in deep vein thrombosis. Aneurysmal or occlusive arterial disease is, however, rare. The authors report five cases of vascular Behcet's disease reviewed over a period of 4 years (1996-1999). All these patients were men and the mean age was 38 years. The arterial disease was the presenting symptom of Behcet's disease in 3 cases. The other patients had been followed up for Behcet's disease for 4 years. The average time of onset of arterial disease was 7.2 years with respect to the presenting symptom, the range being 2 to 20 years. In all, seven arteries were involved, two patients having two arterial sites at the same time. The femoral artery was involved in 3 cases. The iliac artery was involved twice. One patient had a coronary thrombosis and the last case was of a pseudoaneurysm of the infra-renal abdominal aorta which ruptured into the retroperitoneal space. Six lesions were aneurysmal. All patients underwent surgery. The histological analysis of the resected lesions showed non-specific panvasculitis. The postoperative period was marked by short and medium term complications: four prosthetic thromboses and two anastomotic pseudo-aneurysms which required several surgical procedures and which led to two deaths. These results and a review of the literature underline the need to search for Behcet's disease in all cases of aneurysmal or occlusive arterial disease in young patients, especially those born in the Mediterranean regions. Surgical treatment should not be delayed. In these inflammatory conditions with pronounced perivascular involvement, the surgery is difficult and postoperative complications are common, especially anastomotic disunion. Medical treatment has no surgical implication, but does not prevent progression of the disease.
