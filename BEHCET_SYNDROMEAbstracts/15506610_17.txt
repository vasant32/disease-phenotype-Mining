PURPOSE: To report a case of posterior uveitis with retinal neovascularization in a patient with Behçet disease treated with infliximab. METHODS: A 50-year-old man with a history of recurrent relapses of ocular inflammation despite immunosuppressive therapy developed retinal neovascularization near the optic disk. The patient was treated with infliximab and followed up for 12 months. RESULTS: Retinal neovascularization regressed 8 months after the first anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment and with six infusions of infliximab. The ocular inflammation resolved almost completely. CONCLUSIONS: The result suggests that anti-TNF therapy may be effective in the treatment of retinal neovascularization caused by panuveitis in Behçet disease.
