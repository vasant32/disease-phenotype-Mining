BACKGROUND: In BehÃ§et's disease (BD), there is a marked increase in vascular complications. Approximately 30% of patients with BD suffer from thrombosis of the arteries and veins, varices, aneurysms, and thrombophlebitis of superficial or deep veins. Protein C and Protein S are major inhibitors of coagulation, and it is well known that the deficiency of Protein C and Protein S causes thrombotic disorders. METHODS: Protein C and Protein S activities were measured in 23 patients with BD and in a control group consisting of 23 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Patients who had received anticoagulant or oral contraceptive drugs, or who had liver disease or active thrombosis, were not included in the study. RESULTS: Of the 23 patients with BD (age, 13-55 years), the mean Protein S activities (94.2 +/- 11.3%) were slightly lower than the means of the control group (109.1 +/- 8.4%), but not statistically significant differences could be demonstrated (p > 0.05). Compared with the means of the control group (103.5 +/- 6.9%), the Protein C activities were not lower in BD (106.3 +/- 8.4%). No statistical difference was determined. CONCLUSIONS: Protein C and Protein S deficiencies are not a probable cause of thrombotic manifestations in BD. We do not recommend the measurement of these activities routinely in BD unless thrombosis is the major and primary manifestation of BD.
