Salmonelloses are becoming more frequented. To date, very few cases of aneurisms or vascular grafts infections have been described. We report the rare case of an extradigestive manifestation, due to Salmonella enteritidis affecting a patient with Beh√ßet disease. The biological diagnosis is based on microorganism isolation from the site of infection but also from blood cultures. The initial treatment combined antibiotherapy and surgical procedure and replacement of the arteriovenous graft.
