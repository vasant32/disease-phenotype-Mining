Behcet's disease (BD) was originally described by Turkish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet in 1937. BD is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause, characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. All these common manifestations are self-limiting except for ocular attacks. The aims of this study were to assess whether BD patients have more genotoxicity than healthy controls and whether colchicine (COL) treated BD patients are different from those not using COL in terms of genotoxicity. A few dozens of methods have been developed and used for the assessment of genotoxicity. The most popular method is based on single cell gel electrophoresis (COMET assay) in alkaline condition. After electrophoresis, captured images are subjected to digital image analysis to find the values for percent tail DNA from comet assay parameters consistent with genotoxicity. COMET assay was performed in isolated lymphocytes from 42 COL treated Behcet's disease patients, 9 BD patients not using COL, and 36 healthy controls. In the COL-BD patients and non-COL-BD patients, the mean age (range 14-56 years) and mean disease duration (range 0.5-24 years) did not differ between the two groups. We found statistical differences in percent tail DNA between BD and the healthy controls (13.38+/-9.58 versus 2.77+/-1.45, P<0.0001). No difference in percent tail DNA was observed between users and non-users of COL, whereas it was more different in inactive BD patients than active ones (19.75+/-10.49 versus 11.83+/-8.79, P<0.05, respectively). Genotoxicity, as assessed by COMET assay, is increased in BD patients. These results suggest that genotoxicity is associated with BD itself rather than COL use.
