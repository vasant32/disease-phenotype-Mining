Forty-two Tunisian patients suffering from Beh√ßet's disease (23 with uveitis) were typed for HLA-DR and DQ antigens. There was a significant excess of HLA-DQw3 (p less than 0.01) but also an important deficiency of HLA-DRw6 and DQw1 (p less than 0.01). A substantial increase of HLA-DR2 (p less than 0.01) for those with uveitis, and of HLA-DR4, DR7, for the others has been recorded (p less than 0.01).
