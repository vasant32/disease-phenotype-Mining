Sera of patients diagnosed as having the active Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, Behcet's syndrome or sympathetic ophthalmia as well as normal controls were evaluated by ELISA and by staining of normal human retinal tissue using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique for anti-retinal antibodies. No anti-retinal S-antigen antibodies were detected by ELISA. However, autoimmune antibodies were found against the outer segments of photoreceptors and MÃ¼ller cells in patients with the VKH syndrome, with lower titers in some patients with Behcet's syndrome, and in a few patients with sympathetic ophthalmia. These results suggested anti-retinal antibodies were present and that retinal autoimmunity may play a role in pathogenesis in varieties of posterior uveitis. In addition, the indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique may facilitate the diagnosis of VKH in uncertain cases.
