We present a case of a 44-year-old woman with Behçet's disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. The patient was readmitted with symptoms of dizziness and angina pectoris that became more severe with movement of her left arm. Angiography revealed a totally occlusive stenosis, caused by coronary subclavian steal syndrome, which was detected in the left subclavian artery. The aim of this report is to emphasize the relationship between Behçet's disease and vascular occlusive changes.
