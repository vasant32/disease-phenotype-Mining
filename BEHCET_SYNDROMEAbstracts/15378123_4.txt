Beh√ßet's disease is currently recognized as a multisystemic disease that may present with vascular, cutaneous, pulmonary, neurologic, rheumatologic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary manifestations. Despite this multiplicity, cardiac involvement and also the coexistence of bilateral pulmonary arterial aneurysms are rare. An interesting case is presented here with intracardiac thrombi and bilateral pulmonary arterial aneurysms that showed clinical regression with immunosuppressive therapy.
