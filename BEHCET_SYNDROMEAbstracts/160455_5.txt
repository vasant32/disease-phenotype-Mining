We investigated the pattern of genetic susceptibility to rheumatic diseases in Indians by means of HLA analysis. HLA B27 was present in more than 90% of cases included under the broad category or seronegative spondarthritides. In this respect our data resembled results reported for Caucasian populations. In our population, however, the phenotypic frequency of HLA B27 was low as reported from Japan.
