Behcet's disease (BD) is an inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, which usually presents with mucocutaneous, ocular, articular, vascular, gastrointestinal and central nervous system manifestations. Although cardiac involvement is not infrequent as a manifestation of Behcet's disease, coronary arteritis is very rarely reported. We suggest that the diagnosis of coronary arteritis should be considered in patients presenting acute myocardial infarction especially in young patients as underlying cause.
