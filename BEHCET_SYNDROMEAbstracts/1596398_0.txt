The authors evaluated the type of neurological involvement existing in patients with Behçet's syndrome over a 10 year period. Nine patients presenting several bouts with neurological symptomatology were studied with headache being clinically predominant followed in order of frequency by sensitive and/or motor ictal pictures. Suspected localization was both hemispheric and brain stem. No diagnostic test was able to clear up the origin of the lesions in the first stages of the disease, however the authors were able to observe, upon performing visual and/or brain stem evoked potentials and nuclear magnetic resonance at the time of the control, that several asymptomatic patients showed alterations in both tests. Thus, the value of the above mentioned tests must be emphasized in the follow up and control of neuro-Behçet's disease.
