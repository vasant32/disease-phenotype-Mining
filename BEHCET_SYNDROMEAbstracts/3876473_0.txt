In many cases antibiotic treatment is indicated; steroids are not always needed. In special cases of uveitis (Behcet's syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, anterior uveitis in children with JRA) cytostatic treatment seems justified. Inflammations of the optic disk and nerve require very extensive diagnostic evaluation. Medical treatment is usually limited to steroids, administered systemically and locally; however, its efficacy is still a matter of debate.
