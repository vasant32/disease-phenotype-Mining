 OBJECTIVE: To study the oxidant/antioxidant status in Beh√ßet's disease (BD) patients and the potential link between antioxidant enzymatic defences impairment and the disease duration, activity and severity. METHODS: 40 BD patients (27 males, 13 females; mean age: 38.8 years) were prospectively enrolled in the study and compared to a sex and age matched control group. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), the reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were analysed in both groups. A correlation analysis was performed between these parameters and disease duration, activity and severity. Activity and severity of BD were assessed meaning two respective clinical scores. RESULTS: When compared to controls MDA was increased and GSH/GSSG reduced in BD patients (respectively p<0.005). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower while catalase was significantly higher in BD than in controls. Correlation analysis showed that SOD activity was significantly and negatively correlated to disease duration and activity but not to severity. Other oxidant/antioxidant markers were not significantly linked to neither disease duration nor activity and severity. CONCLUSION: Our study confirm the existence of an oxidative stress (OS) state in BD as shown by the increase of MDA and the diminution of GSH/GSSG ratio which can be used as another index of OS. Despite this OS state, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and especially of SOD is impaired and negatively correlated to the disease duration and activity. We think that a rational strengthening of antioxidant defences should be part of an optimal treatment strategy.
