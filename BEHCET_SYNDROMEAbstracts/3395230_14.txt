Behçet's disease is characterized by recurrent ulcers of the mouth and genitalia and relapsing iritis. It is now recognized as a chronic multisystem disease affecting the skin, mucous membranes, eye, joints, central nervous system, and blood vessels. One of the known vascular complications of Behçet's disease is aneurysm formation or venous thrombosis. The two patients with Behçet's disease in this report developed multiple aneurysms over a short time span. Vascular surgeons dealing with young adults with peripheral aneurysms must be aware of this uncommon yet challenging clinical entity.
