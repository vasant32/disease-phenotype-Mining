Six patients with necrotizing vasculitis were treated with oral colchicine as part of an open study. Four patients with cutaneous vasculitis and normal levels of serum complement and one patient with vasculitis associated with Behcet's syndrome demonstrated clinical improvement while receiving colchicine. One patient with cryoglobulinemia, hypocomplementemia, and cutaneous vasculitis showed no response to colchicine therapy. In three patients, clinical improvement persisted after its withdrawal. Colchicine may be effective in controlling cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis and Behcet's syndrome through its effect on polymorphnuclear leukocyte function.
