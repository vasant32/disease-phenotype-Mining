The aim of this study is to evaluate the in vitro effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) on T Vgamma9/Vdelta2 lymphocyte function in Beh√ßets disease (BD). We investigated the effect of PTX on Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell expansion and expression of TNFRII receptor and perforin content before and after PTX addition by means of FACS analysis lymphocyte cultures from patients with active and inactive BD and healthy subjects. The addition of PTX at a concentration of 1 mg/ml determined a significant inhibition of cell expansion, a down regulation of TNF receptor expression and inhibited the PMA-induced degranulation of perforin. Taken together these data indicate that PTX is capable of interfering with Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell function in BD, and although cell culture models cannot reliably predict all of the potential effects of the drug in vivo, our results encourage the possibility that this drug may find use in a range of immunological disorder characterized by dysregulated cell-mediated immunity.
