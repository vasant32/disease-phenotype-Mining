We describe a patient with Behçet's syndrome who had clinical and angiographic features of widespread cerebral angiitis of small- and medium-caliber vessels. We report the successful treatment of this condition with a combination of cytotoxic agents and steroids, and demonstrate angiographically the resolution of these abnormalities in neuro-Behçet's disease.
