We have studied the characteristics of arthritis present in 32 patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD), and how this arthritis is related to the HLA markers class I. 84% of the patients presented arthritis, the most common being mono-arthritis as the initial presentation, and oligoarthritis in subsequent episodes. In 63% of the cases, the development was in episodes of acute/subacute arthritis. We found statistically significant association between antigens B-5 and B-51, and the group with BD, with a relative risk of 3.89 and 4.71 respectively. The attempt to relate markers B-5, B-51 and B-27 to the presence of arthritis as well as to its manifestation and further development was not conclusive.
