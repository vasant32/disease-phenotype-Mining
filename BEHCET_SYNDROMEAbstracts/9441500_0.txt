The results of Cyclosporin A treatment of 15 patients with Beh√ßet's disease were examined in the study--9 females (aged from 32 to 34 years, mean 33 years) and 12 males (aged from 25 to 55 years, approximately 34.33 years). Among them, the majority were with chorioretinitis (10/15 or 66.6%). Besides chorioretinitis two patients were simultaneously with iridocyclltis, while in three the whole nervous system was affected (meningoencephalitis, simultaneously pyramidal syndrome with the signs of extrapyramidal lesion and consciousness disorder in one patient). In one patient myocarditis was revealed, and the one was with deep aphtous ulcer. The approximate daily dose was 5 mg/kg in 13 patients, and 7.5 mg/kg/d in 2 patients. For that, the level of the drug in blood elevated from 79 to 380 ng/ml, approximately 170 ng/ml. The effect was favourable in 12 patients (complete restraint of the disease evolution), partial in 2 patients (slowing of the disease course) while it was incomplete in one patient for the interruption of the therapy 15 days after its beginning.
