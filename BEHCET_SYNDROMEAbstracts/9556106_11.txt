BACKGROUND: Papulopustular lesions are common in Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS). A debate exists as to whether they are different from ordinary acne. This has important clinical and pathophysiologic implications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathologic features of papulopustular lesions seen both in BS and acne vulgaris (AV). METHODS: Representative samples were obtained from 17 patients with BS and six patients with AV. The detailed histopathologic features were evaluated by a dermatopathologist blinded to the diagnoses. RESULTS: Considering the epidermis, follicle epithelium, and dermis separately, no differences could be found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The papulopustular lesions seen in these two disorders cannot be distinguished on the basis of clinical and histopathologic findings.
