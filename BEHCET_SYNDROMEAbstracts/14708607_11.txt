Thalidomide is an effective treatment for several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including erythema nodosum leprosum, Behcet's syndrome, discoid lupus erythematosus, and Crohn's disease. Thalidomide is believed to exert its anti-inflammatory effects, at least in part, by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production by monocytes. We studied the effects of thalidomide on epidermal Langerhans cells (LC). LCs are epidermal antigen-presenting dendritic cells that play important roles in skin immune responses. Using the murine epidermis-derived dendritic cell lines, XS106A from A/J mice and XS52 from BALB/c mice as surrogates for LC, we found that thalidomide inhibited TNF-alpha production in a concentration-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis revealed that thalidomide significantly decreased the peak-induced mRNA level of TNF-alpha in XS106A cells and XS52 cells. We then examined the effect of thalidomide on fresh LC enriched to approximately 98% using positive selection of Ia+ cells with antibodies conjugated to magnetic microspheres. TNF-alpha production was reduced by 67.7% at a thalidomide concentration of 200 microg per mL. Thalidomide also had a profound inhibitory effect on the ability of LC to present antigen to a responsive TH1 clone. Thalidomide inhibits TNF-alpha production and the antigen-presenting ability of epidermal LCs. These mechanisms may contribute to the therapeutic effects observed with this agent.
