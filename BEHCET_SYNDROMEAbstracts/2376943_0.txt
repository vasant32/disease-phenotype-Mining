Three patients with Behçet's disease and therapy-resistant posterior uveitis have been treated with cyclosporin A (CS-A) for four years. The uveitis has been controlled better, as indicated by the reduced frequency of inflammation, and there was an initial improvement in visual acuity. However, it has not been possible to prevent a slight, gradual loss of visual acuity over the years. Relapses were observed after dose reductions to blood levels below 400-500 ng/ml and following discontinuation of CS-A therapy. Few relapses occurred at higher CS-A concentrations. It was found that both types of relapse could be controlled by increasing the CS-A dose. An at least transitory increase in creatinine levels as a side effect of CS-A was observed in all patients. The authors' results and reports in the literature suggest that CS-A is an effective immunosuppressive therapy in Behçet's disease and is superior to other immunosuppressives used so far.
