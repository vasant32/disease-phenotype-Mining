 BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine serum vitronectin levels in Behçet patients with and without ocular involvement, and to evaluate the relationship between vitronectin concentrations and clinical manifestations of Behçet's disease (BD). METHODS: Sixty-five patients with BD and 21 control subjects were included. All patients were queried for the clinical manifestations of BD. Serum vitronectin concentrations were determined by using in vitro enzyme immunoassay kits. RESULTS: Serum vitronectin levels between the patients and the control subjects were not different. There was no statistically significant difference between vitronectin levels in Behçet patients with and without ocular involvement. No correlation was found between vitronectin concentrations and clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating vitronectin levels in Behçet patients. Further studies involving larger numbers of subjects would be useful to improve our understanding of the functions of vitronectin in BD.
