Successful aortic stump closure in a patient with Behçet's disease was accomplished with a permanent titanium clamp. In May 1990, a saccular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was detected in this patient, and prosthetic graft replacement was carried out. One year later, this graft was removed because of perigraft fluid collection; the aortic stump was sutured closed, and a right axillobifemoral bypass was done. In November 1994, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of an aortoenteric fistula. An emergency operation was performed, and the aortic stump was managed successfully with a permanent clamp. In patients with Behçet's disease, use of a permanent clamp may offer an alternative to traditional methods for closing blown-out aortic stumps.
