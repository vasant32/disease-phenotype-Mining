Behçet's disease (also known as morbus Behcet or Admantiades-Behcet syndrome) is a chronic vasculitis mainly characterized by recurrent mucocutaneous lesions and sight threatening uveitis. It may also involve joints, vessels of all sizes and the central nervous system. Because of its severe morbidity and considerable mortality early diagnosis and treatment is important. Treatment and prognosis of this disorder have profited considerably in recent years following the introduction of biologic agents. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge and emphasizes the important role of the ophthalmologist in the diagnosis and therapy of Behçet's disease.
