Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is an inflammatory cytokine. We measured its production in 21 Behçet's disease patients, 4 healthy controls, and 4 sarcoidosis patients, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide from peripheral blood monocytes. IL-1 beta production of the posterior segment type was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than in healthy controls, sarcoidosis patients, and anterior segment type. In all posterior segment type cases, IL-1 beta production in the active period was greater than in the remission period. IL-1 beta production is considered to be related to posterior segment type attacks of Behçet's disease.
