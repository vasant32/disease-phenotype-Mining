INTRODUCTION: Aseptic endocarditis or/and endomyocardial fibrosis are rarely reported in Behçet's disease. OBSERVATION: We report on a case of a 21-year-old man living in Algeria, revealed by verrucous tricuspid valvulitis extending to the ventricular endomyocardium and complicated with right heart failure, initially misdiagnosed and treated as infective endocarditis occurring on rheumatic cardiac after-effects. DISCUSSION; We discuss the lack of specificity of Jones criteria and emphasize the need to include cardiac involvement in Behçet's disease in the differential diagnosis of rheumatic fever carditis. This message is notably important in some countries where the prevalence of these two entities are among the highest in the world.
