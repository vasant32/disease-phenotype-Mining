Data on families with Behçet's syndrome were analysed to test a hypothesis of autosomal recessive inheritance. Fifteen families from the UK and nine from Turkey were included. There were 27 individuals with Behçet's syndrome according to the Japanese criteria and 119 unaffected individuals. There were no affected parents in the families. The 'goodness of fit' test of Elandt-Johnson was applied to the distribution of affected individuals in these families, and the data were found to be incompatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. HLA associations were also examined in patients and relatives, and this led to re-examination of previously published data on HLA associations with Behçet's syndrome.
