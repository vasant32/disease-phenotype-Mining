We report a patient with relapsing-remitting meningoencephalitis secondary to neuro-Behcet disease which resulted in recurrent brainstem encephalitis. MRI revealed increased signal intensity on the proton density and T2-weighted images and gadolinium enhancement during relapses. Autopsy revealed acute on chronic meningoencephalomyelitis involving the entire CNS, which was most marked in the brainstem.
