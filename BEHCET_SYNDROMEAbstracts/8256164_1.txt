We studied the relationship between vascular complications and coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters in ten subjects with Behçet's disease. We found that patients with Behçet's disease were in a state of hypercoagulation and hyperfibrinolysis. In vascular Behçet's disease in particular, coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters appeared to be indices of vascular complications. Analysis of the multimeric structure of von Willebrand factor (vWF) revealed a tendency for large multimer of vWF to increase in patients with Behçet's disease with accompanying vascular complications, whereas such increase were not observed in patients with Behçet's disease without any vascular complications. Therefore, analysis of vWF multimeric structure and the determination of coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters in plasma appear to be useful indicators of vascular complications in Behçet's disease.
