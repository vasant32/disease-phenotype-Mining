Sixty-three consecutive Behçet's syndrome patients with an acute arthritis of up to 10 days duration were treated either with azapropazone (APZ) 300 mg t.i.d. or placebo for three weeks. Twenty-eight patients (14 males, 14 females: mean age 36.2 +/- 8.1 SD years) from the APZ group and 29 patients (18 males, 11 females; mean age 34.2 +/- 8.4 SD years) from the placebo group completed the trial. At the end of the trial the arthritis persisted in 53.5% (15/28) of the APZ patients and in 41.3% (12/29) of the placebo patients (chi 2 = 0.85; NS). Six patients (6/28; 21%) from the APZ group and 9 patients (9/29; 31%) from the placebo group developed new joint involvement (chi 2 = 0.7; NS). There was no difference in the duration of arthritis between the two groups (19.9 +/- 8.3 SD days in the APZ groups vs. 19.7 +/- 8.2 SD days in the placebo group; NS). The degree of joint swelling, the tender joint score and the visual analogue score for pain significantly improved in both groups, but there was no difference in any of these parameters between the groups except for a significant difference in the visual analogue score for less pain at the first week in the azapropazone group (t = 2.23; p < 0.05). There were also no differences in the mean numbers of acetaminophen tablets used or in the CRP and ESR levels between the two groups. We conclude that azapropazone is not effective in controlling the arthritis of Behçet's syndrome.
