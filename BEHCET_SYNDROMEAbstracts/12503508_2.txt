Behçet's disease can be revealed by neurologic signs. CASE REPORTS: We report two pediatric cases of Behçet's disease which initially presented with cerebral venous thrombosis. Glucocorticoïds, associated with anticoagulant treatment allowed a rapid recovery. One of the children presented three years later a thrombotic recurrence. CONCLUSION: A cerebral venous thrombosis may reveal Behçet's disease.
