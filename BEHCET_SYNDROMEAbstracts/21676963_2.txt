 AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the left ventricular (LV) systolic strain by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in order to provide the early detection of myocardial dysfunction in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). We also aimed to examine the relationship between LV systolic strain and N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which is a cardiac biomarker of ventricular dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Longitudinal and circumferential systolic strain assessed by STE was obtained in 32 BD patients and 27 age-matched controls. NT-proBNP levels were also measured in all subjects. Regional and mean longitudinal strain (-17.8 ± 2.7 vs. -20.5 ± 1.8%; P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in BD patients when compared with the healthy controls. Whereas regional and mean circumferential strain values (-22.0 ± 1.6 vs. -22.2 ± 2.3%; P = 0.62) did not reveal a significant difference between the patients and the controls. NT-proBNP was significantly higher in the patients than in the controls (65.18 ± 84.51 vs. 30.84 ± 14.75 pg/mL; P = 0.003). Linear regression analyses revealed only NT-proBNP as the independent correlate of mean LV longitudinal strain (R = 0.603, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Longitudinal myocardial systolic function assessed by STE, which is a sensitive marker of subclinical ventricular dysfunction is impaired in BD. Increased NT-proBNP levels may be a sign of subclinical ventricular dysfunction in these patients.
