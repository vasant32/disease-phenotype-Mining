We report the case of an 29-year-old male Turkish patient suffering from generalized Behçet's disease. After an evolution of twelve years, he suddenly presented a nephrotic syndrome, a terminal renal insufficiency and thrombosis of the renal veins as well as the inferior vena cava. A percutaneous renal biopsy showed amyloidosis of the AA type, characteristic of secondary amyloidosis. Attempts to install an arterio venous shunt of the arm and to set up a peritoneal dialysis catheter were complicated by septic thrombosis. The patient died of renal failure. The association of renal amyloidosis and Behçet's disease is rare. It is, as far as we know, the first case reported in Switzerland.
