A 67-year-old man, in whom a linear ulcer running from the duodenal bulb to the descending part had been noted 3 years previously, was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and melena. Duodenoscopy revealed a bleeding giant longitudinal ulcer, which was more extensive than before. Tests for Helicobacter pylori (Hp) were negative. The ulcer was cured by endoscopic hemostasis and repeated blood transfusions. Attention must be paid to Hp-negative post-bulbar duodenal ulcers because of the frequent complications including hemorrhage.
