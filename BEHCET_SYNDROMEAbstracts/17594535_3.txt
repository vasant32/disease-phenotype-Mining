Beh√ßet's Disease (BD) is a multisystemic inflammatory disorder as a triad of symptoms including recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulceration, and uveitis with unknown pathogenesis. Many researchers have tried to investigate the association of HLA-B51 gene with the BD. We aimed to investigate the association of the HLA-B51 gene and its expression, also polymorphic structure by PCR, RT-PCR and sequence specific oligonucleotide primers and probes in BD patients (n: 35) and control group (n: 50). According to our results, we did not observe any association in between HLA-B51 gene, its polymorphism, expression and BD patients.
