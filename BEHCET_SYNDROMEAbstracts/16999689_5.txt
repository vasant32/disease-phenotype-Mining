 OBJECTIVES: Subclinical cardiac involvement may occur in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). The purpose of our study was to assess the noninvasive parameters of biventricular function derived from Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) of the tricuspid and mitral annular motion in BD. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with BD and 20 control subjects were enrolled in this study. All subjects were selected to exclude those with cardiovascular risk factors. Standard echocardiography and pulsed DTI were obtained in every patient. RESULTS: Peak systolic (13.71 +/- 2.09 vs 20.01 +/- 1.57, P < 0.001), peak early diastolic (11.26 +/- 2.52 vs 15.35 +/- 2.06, P < 0.001) tricuspid annular velocities were significantly lower in patients than controls. Peak systolic (8.68 +/- 1.4 vs 12.25 +/- 1.7, P < 0.001), peak early diastolic (7.89 +/- 1.07 vs 9.94 +/- 1.12, P < 0.001), and peak end diastolic (8.30 +/- 1.32 vs 9.23 +/- 0.91, P = 0.013) lateral mitral annular velocities were significantly lower in patients than controls. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that myocardial velocities, were affected in patients with BD. Therefore, we conclude that right and left ventricular function is impaired in patients with BD.
