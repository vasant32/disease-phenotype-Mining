Behçet's disease is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder associated with recurrent oral and genital ulcers and iritis. Vascular lesions are encountered in 7%-29% of patients, gravely affecting the course of the disease. Extracranial carotid aneurysms due to Behçet's disease are extremely rare. We describe a surgically treated case of Behçet's disease in a 28-year-old man who presented with a rapidly enlarging left common carotid artery aneurysm.
