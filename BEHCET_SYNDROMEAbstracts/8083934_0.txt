Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disorder thought to be the result of an autoimmune vasculitis. Patients classically present with the clinical triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcers and relapsing uveitis. Complications have been reported following pulmonary angiography to diagnose associated pulmonary artery aneurysms. We report a case of pulmonary artery aneurysm in BD confirmed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
