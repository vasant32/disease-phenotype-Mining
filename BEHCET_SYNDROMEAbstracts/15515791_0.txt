A case of Beh√ßet's syndrome in a 32-year-old woman occurring shortly after her third vaccination against typhoid fever is described. Scleritis and pyoderma gangrenosum were unusual manifestations of BS that occurred in this case. Treatment benefit was provided by mycophenolate mofetil and etanercept. As bacterial antigens have been proposed as potential triggers for the onset of BS, it is possible that the syndrome was precipitated by typhoid vaccination in this patient.
