Behcet's disease is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disease of unknown cause that involves mucous surfaces, skin, eyes, joints, and the CNS. Although not reported in the pediatric literature, some cases start in childhood. This report describes a child whose chronic oral and genital ulcers preceded recognition of her gastrointestinal tract, eye, and CNS disease for nine years. The current knowledge of Behcet's disease in children is discussed.
