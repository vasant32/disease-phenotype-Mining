To study the long-term evolution of cerebral lesions in neuro-Behçet's disease, MRI was carried out on 12 patients, with follow-up from 1.5 to 6 years (mean 3.5 years). On the first MRI, 66 lesions in all were found; each patient had 1-10 lesions (mean 5.5). There were 30 (46%) lesions in the brain stem, 18 (27%) in the basal ganglia region and 18 (27%) in the periventricular white matter. Of these 22 (33%) were small, 31 (47%) medium-size and 13 (20%) large lesions. On the last MRI, 60 lesions were found: each patient had 1-10 lesions (mean 5). At this time 31 lesions (52%) were in the brain stem, 13 (22%) in the basal ganglia region and 16 (26%) in the periventricular white matter. There were 41 (68%) small, 13 (22%) medium-size and 6 (10%) large lesions. About 40% of the lesions disappeared, 35% reduced in size and 25% remained unchanged. No lesion had enlarged. Of the 60 final lesions 20 (34%) were not observed on the first study. Small new lesions were found in 5 of 12 patients (42%), and were asymptomatic. Medium-size or large new lesions were found in 2 patients (17%) who had stopped steroid treatment and had a neurological relapse. Enlargement of the ventricular system or worsening of initial cerebral atrophy was observed in 9 of 12 patients. Appearance of small lesions and worsening of cerebral atrophy on long-term follow-up suggest the possibility of subclinical progression of cerebral vasculitis and should be considered in the prognosis of neuro-Behçet's disease.
