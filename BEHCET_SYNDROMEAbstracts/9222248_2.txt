 PURPOSE: To report a 61-year-old man with sudden onset of visual loss in both eyes related to bilateral macular ischemia. METHODS: The patient underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination including slit-lamp and fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and visual field testing as well as biologic screening. RESULTS: Bilateral macular ischemia associated with peripheral retinal vasculitis was confirmed by angiography. We diagnosed Behçet disease by association of ocular, oral, and cutaneous involvement according to the criteria of the international study group for Behçet disease. The patient was treated with corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: In Behçet disease, sudden onset of bilateral vision loss may be associated with bilateral retinal vascular disease and macular ischemia. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial.
