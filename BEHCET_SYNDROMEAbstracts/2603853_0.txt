Six patients with complete type Behçet's disease were studied electro-retinographically and electro-oculographically. The electrical responses tested include the hyperosmolarity response in the EOG, the oscillatory potentials and the rapid off-response in the ERG. The oscillatory potentials diminished in five eyes of four cases. In all except one of these eyes the rapid off-response and the hyperosmolarity response were within normal ranges. The hyperosmolarity response was suppressed in one eye which suffered from severe diffuse uveitis and iridocyclitis accompanied with hypopyon. The a-wave, the b-wave, the oscillatory potentials and the rapid off-response were also abnormal in this eye. The hyperosmolarity response was abnormal in an eye with severe ocular lesions of Behçet's disease, while the oscillatory potentials were frequently abnormal even in the earlier stages of the disease. The hyperosmolarity response originates in the retinal pigment epithelial layer. The oscillatory potentials originate in the inner retinal layer. Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that the initial retinal lesions take place in the inner retinal layer in Behçet's disease.
