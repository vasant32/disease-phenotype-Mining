 BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is a collagen-vascular disease most commonly seen in Asia and Mediterranean area. Different organs and systems including cardiovascular system could be involved. Pseudoaneurysm is the most common form of arterial involvement in Behçet's disease; however, cardiac pseudoaneurysm is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A rare case of 13 years old boy with a 4-year history of Behçet's disease with development of a huge left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is reported who had been admitted because of cough, chills, fever, and chest pain. Findings obtained on echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, chest computed tomography and coronary angiography confirmed a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm. There was no complication for next 24 months follow up period after surgical treatment. CONCLUSION: Considering its fatality and nonspecific manifestations, one should consider cardiac pseudoaneurysms as a potential risk in any patient with Behçet's disease.
