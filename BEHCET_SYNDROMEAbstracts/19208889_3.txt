We present a case of Mycobacterium kansasii olecranon bursitis in a woman with known immunosuppression secondary to the treatment received for her Beh√ßet's disease. We found only one other case report of olecranon bursitis caused by M. kansasii in the literature, which, unlike our case, presented in an immunocompetent adult following trauma. This case extends the range of opportunistic mycobacterial infections that are associated with anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy.
