The authors report a patient with Beh√ßet disease who developed severe central neurological disturbances. The M.R.I. was largely coincident with the distribution of the lesions verified in the neuropathological examination, while CT only shows an hypodense lesion in basal ganglia with contrast enhancement. The neurological symptoms did not respond to a treatment with prednisone and azathioprine. The main histopathological findings are similar to those described by previous observers. Reactive histiocytic infiltration with severe lymphocytic phagocytosis, probably related to immunosuppressor treatment, was also observed.
