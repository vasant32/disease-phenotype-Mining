Cardiac involvement in Behçet's disease is quite uncommon. We report a case of Behçet's disease with aortic regurgitation of which histology was examined. A 56-year-old male came to our hospital with a complaint of right cervical pain. Diagnosis of aortic regurgitation was made by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and aortography. As the cardiac lesion worsened, the operation of the aortic valve replacement was performed. On pathological examination, there was marked fibrous thickening on the aortic valve and the rupture of elastic tissue in the media of aortic wall. There was no history of rheumatic fever nor syphilis, and dilation of orifice of the aorta was not observed. Thus these changes were probably due to Behçet's disease itself.
