OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to investigate the possible role of human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) polymorphism in susceptibility to Behçet's disease. METHODS: Eighty-five patients with Behçet's disease gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. Seven point mutations (G191A, C282T, T341C, C481T, A803G, G590A, G857A) in the NAT2 gene were analysed using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. In addition, each patient received 100 mg dapsone orally to determine their NAT2 phenotype. Dapsone and its metabolite monoacetyl-dapsone were measured in 3-h plasma samples using high-performance liquid chromatography. Subjects with an acetylation ratio (monoacetyl-dapsone/dapsone) less than 0.4 were defined as slow acetylators. RESULTS: Of 85 patients with Behçet's disease, 54 (63.5%) were identified as genotypically slow acetylators. However, 60% (51 of 85) of patients were diagnosed as slow acetylators according to monoacetyl-dapsone/dapsone ratio. Thus, a low incidence of genotype/phenotype discrepancy (3.5%) was observed in Turkish patients with Behcet's disease. When we compared our results with previous phenotyping and genotyping studies in the Turkish population, frequencies of slow and rapid acetylators were not statistically different in patients with Behçet's disease. The frequency of the *5B allele was found to be slightly higher in patients with Behçet's disease than historic controls (44.7 vs 35.6%, P = 0.039). However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of the overall genotypes and alleles of NAT2 between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of the NAT2*5B allele, responsible for slow acetylation, was slightly higher in patients than historic controls, our results failed to show an association between NAT2-acetylator status and risk for developing Behçet's disease.
