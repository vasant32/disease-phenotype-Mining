 OBJECTIVES: The numbers and recurrence rates of mucocutaneous manifestations can be highly variable among patients with Behçet's syndrome (BS) but it is not known whether these differences influence the disease course at the long-term. METHODS: We evaluated the outcome of 30 patients that made up the placebo arm of a 6 months controlled trial of thalidomide and looked at the relation between the frequencies of mucocutaneous manifestations during the trial and the development of major organ involvement necessitating immunosuppressives during the post-trial period. RESULTS: Fifteen (50%) patients had received immunosuppresives for major organ involvement during the post-trial period. Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment were significantly younger at the onset of BS compared to those who did not (24.5±5 vs. 29.7±3.8 SD years; p=0.003). The mean number of oral ulcers recorded throughout the trial was significantly higher among patients using immunosuppressives compared to those who did not (2.09±0.96 vs. 1.43±0.8; p=0.029). This significance disappeared when adjusted for age of onset of BS (p=0.16). ROC curve analysis showed that having 10 or more ulcers during 6 months has a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 53% for the subsequent necessity of immunosuppressive use. The same association was not true for genital ulcers, follicular lesions and erythema nodosum. CONCLUSIONS: These findings on a limited number of patients suggest that frequent occurrence of oral ulceration during the initial years of the disease may predict the development of major organ involvement in men with BS.
