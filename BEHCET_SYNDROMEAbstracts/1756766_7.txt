Three patients with neuro-Beh√ßet underwent MRI and MRS during acute illness. After therapy, MRI and MRS were performed in 3 and 1 patients, respectively. MRI revealed a marked improvement of the initial lesion in 2, a complete remission in 1 patient. MRS showed a reduction of the N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA)/phosphocreatine (CR) ratio within the acute lesion in all patients and a normalization in the follow-up spectrum of the examined patient.
