BACKGROUND: Piroxicam is a widely used anti-inflammatory drug. Most adverse reactions affect gastrointestinal system, liver and skin. Fixed drug eruption although very unusual, has also been described, but with cutaneous involvement exclusively. We present the case of a 49-year-old man who suffered three episodes of fixed drug eruption with cutaneous-mucosal involvement, even simulating an autoimmune disease, whenever he was treated with oral piroxicam. METHODS AND RESULTS: He was patch tested on normal skin with the GEIDC standard series and an NSAIDs series. He was patch tested on normal skin and on fixed eruption with piroxicam, meloxicam and tenoxicam (all of them 1 % pet). Oral challenge test was not performed due to the severity and reproducibility in previous reactions. Results showed a positive patch test to piroxicam (1 % pet) on fixed eruption, with negative results to the rest. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions may present a wide variability of clinical symptoms. In these situations an accurate clinical history is necessary. To our knowledge this is the 1st report of non-pigmenting fixed drug eruption with cutaneous-mucosal involvement due to piroxicam. Cross-reactivity between oxicams could not be demonstrated by patch test on fixed eruption.
