Abdominal aortic false aneurysms in patients with Behcet's disease have been reported frequently and repaired successfully by various procedures; however, anastomotic false aneurysms have often been reported to occur after the operation. In this article, we report a case of four-time repetitive, recurrent suprarenal abdominal aortic false aneurysm ruptures that lasted for 7 years. The location of this aneurysm was not easy to repair not only by open surgical procedures but by endovascular stent because the aortic defect was too close to the visceral arterial branches. The last operation consisted of primary repair of aortic defect, transection of abdominal aorta at the level of supraceliac aorta with end closure, and a thoracic aorta to abdominal aorta bypass with Dacron graft. An 8-year follow-up revealed no more abdominal aortic aneurysm recurrence.
