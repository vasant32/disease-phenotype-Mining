 OBJECTIVE: It has been shown previously that three nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) variants (Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg and Lue1007fs) are associated with Crohn's disease (CD), a disorder clinically resembling Beh√ßet's disease (BD). We studied the frequency of these variants in BD patients. METHODS: DNA samples of 200 BD patients [59 Caucasians, 139 Middle Easterns (MEs) of Arab descent and 2 Asians] and 520 healthy controls (444 Caucasians and 76 MEs) were genotyped using a Taqman assay. RESULTS: Both the Arg702Trp and Leu1007fs (frameshift) variants were significantly less frequently present among BD patients compared with healthy controls (0.5 vs 5.8%; P < 1.10(-5) and 0.0 vs 1.8%; P < 0.007, respectively). In the Caucasian subpopulation, Arg702Trp was significantly less frequent in the BD group as compared with the controls (P = 0.04); whereas in the ME subpopulation, a trend was observed (P < 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Of the three CD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, one of the variant NOD2 alleles, was found to be present significantly less in Caucasian BD patients.
