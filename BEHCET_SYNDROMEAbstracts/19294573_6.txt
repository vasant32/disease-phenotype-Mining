 PURPOSE: To determine the association of fluorescein angiography characteristics with visual acuity and visual loss during medical treatment in patients with Behçet uveitis. METHODS: Ninety-three eyes from 69 Behçet patients with active panuveitis underwent fluorescein angiography, and the characteristic findings by angiography were determined. The patients were followed with immunomodulatory treatment. RESULTS: Diffuse vascular leakage (73.4%), diffuse macular leakage (66.0%), and disc leakage (52.7%) were the predominant angiographic findings on fluorescein angiography. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a macular window defect and disc neovascularization on fluorescein angiography were associated with poor visual acuity (<or= 20/200) (p < .05). The presence of macular ischemia on fluorescein angiography was significantly associated with the risk of visual loss (<or= 20/200) at 48 months post-treatment (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that fluorescein angiography may be helpful for predicting visual prognosis for Behçet patients with panuveitis.
