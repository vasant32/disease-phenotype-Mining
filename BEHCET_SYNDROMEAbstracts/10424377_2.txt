Adamantiades-Behçet disease is a multifocal entity which was first described by Hippocrates 500 years BC. The disease is characterised by relapsing oral aphthae, genital ulcers and iritis, while 24-40% of cases present with arterial or venous thromboses, arterial aneurysms or varices. In rare cases, due to invasion of different systems, the clinical picture varies, making timely diagnosis difficult. The disease is common all over the world but is more frequent in Japan, Korea, China and the Middle East. The first description in contemporary times was made by the Greek ophthalmologist Benedict Adamantiades in 1931, and the disease was described for the second time, independently, by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behçet in 1937.
