A patient with Beh√ßet's disease developed the rare complications of pericarditis and, two months later, superior vena caval obstruction. The latter complication was investigated by angiography to exclude other causes. As a result of this investigation the caval obstruction was managed conservatively, the symptoms and signs improving spontaneously.
