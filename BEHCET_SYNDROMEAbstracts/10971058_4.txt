BACKGROUND: Between May 1995 and April 1996, 20 patients with Behçet's disease were successfully treated with interferon alpha(2a) (IFN-alpha(2a)) 9 million IU/day three times a week and 16 patients with colchicine 1.5 mg/day orally for 3 months. OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term effects of IFN treatment in Behçet's disease. METHODS: Between the years of 1996 and 1999, the patients were followed up every 3 months or whenever indicated. Retrospective evaluation was performed. RESULTS: In 56% of the patients with complete remission or partial remission at the end of IFN-alpha(2a) treatment, long-term remissions ranging from 36 to 48 months were observed. CONCLUSION: IFN-alpha(2a) treatment is an effective treatment modality in Behçet's disease with the advantage of inducing prolonged remissions.
