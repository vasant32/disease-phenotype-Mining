The group of seronegative rheumatic spondylarthropathies (spondarthritis) includes different diseases with common features. The common characteristics of these diseases are sacroiliitis and/or spondylitis, usually oligoarticular arthritis, distinct extraarticular manifestations of the skin, mucous membranes, eyes and internal organs, and a common genetic disposition. To differentiate the diseases within this group, of which spondylitis ankylosans counts as the prototype, allowance must be made for radiomorphological changes of the spine, the various joints involved and the type of extraarticular symptoms. The therapy depends upon the type of disease, although the therapeutic principles remain the same as far as the spine is concerned; pain treatment and conservation of spine mobility are the main factors.
