 PURPOSE: To report a case of cutaneous skin hypopigmentation following a posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection for uveitis. DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A 28-year-old African American female with Adamantiades-Behcet disease and panuveitis was administered a posterior sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide and developed cutaneous hypopigmentation. RESULTS: The patient developed skin hypopigmentation of the upper eyelid adjacent to the site of the sub-Tenon injection. CONCLUSION: Injection of corticosteroids into the sub-Tenon space can cause hypopigmentation of the adjacent tissues, especially in heavily pigmented individuals.
