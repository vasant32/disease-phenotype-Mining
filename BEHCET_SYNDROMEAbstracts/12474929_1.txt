PURPOSE: To report the rare occurrence of conjunctival ulceration in a patient with Behcet's disease. METHODS: Case report. A 35 year old "Beh√ßet's suspect" on azathioprine presented to the ophthalmic emergency room with a painful ulceration involving the inferior palpebral conjunctiva of her left eye. RESULTS: The ulcer responded to treatment with topical steroids and healed without scarring. CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctival ulceration is not a common manifestation of Behcet's disease. Its occurrence during maintenance therapy with azathioprine in a patient with Behcets could be either incidental or indicate inadequate immunosuppression.
