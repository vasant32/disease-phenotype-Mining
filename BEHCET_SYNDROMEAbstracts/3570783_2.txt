Up till now no standard therapy for Behçet syndrome has existed. Long-term corticoid therapy is often necessary, although side-effects cannot be avoided. Recent investigations have shown a correlation between high endogenous gamma-interferon serum levels and low activity of the syndrome. A 20-year-old male with severe Behçet's syndrome was therefore treated with recombinant alpha-A-interferon (IFN). The general condition of the patient improved rapidly, together with rapid clearing of the skin lesions. Over a 10.5 week-period the patient received a total dose of 792 million IU recombinant alpha-A-interferon.
