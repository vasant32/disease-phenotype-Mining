Ocular symptoms of Behçet's syndrome in 16 patients and the results of cytostatic and immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporin A (6 patients), chlorambucil (6 patients), and a combination of cyclophosphamide and procarbacin (4 patients) are described. The clinical course and therapeutic outcome were compared to the patients' visual acuity and the duration of the disease prior to institution of cytostatic therapy. Average follow-up was 4.6 years, maximum 9 years. The principal ocular symptom in all patients was hemorrhagic, occlusive periphlebitis. Other symptoms, in descending order of frequency, were chorioretinitis, iridocyclitis, complicated cataract, secondary glaucoma and exudative retinal detachment. The patients in whom cytostatic therapy was instituted no later than 6 months after onset of the disease showed an improvement in or stabilization of visual acuity, as well as a clear reduction in signs of intraocular inflammation and frequency of recurrence. No improvement in visual acuity or ocular symptoms was achieved in cases where the disease was very advanced, despite cytostatic-immunosuppressive therapy. The results support early institution of immunosuppressive therapy in cases with Behçet's syndrome where severe, irreversible damage has not yet occurred and in which vision is threatened in both eyes. However, due consideration must be given to the potential risks of immunosuppressive therapy, in particular the risk of a malignant tumor.
