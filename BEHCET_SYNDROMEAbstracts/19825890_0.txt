Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of uncertain etiology. Many genetic and environmental risk factors have been associated with this disease including certain human leukocyte antigen haplotypes, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and vitamin D deficiency. We report a 30-year-old woman with MS, the product of consanguineous marriage, and three siblings with three different autoimmune diseases: idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, celiac disease, and Beh√ßet's disease.
