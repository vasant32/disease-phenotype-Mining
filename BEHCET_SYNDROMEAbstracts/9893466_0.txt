The purpose of this study is to elucidate the relationships between subjective life satisfaction and the following 8 factors of quality of life: physical condition, daily living activities, working condition, economic status, social status, medical status, marriage status, mental status. One hundred and fifty-four male and 116 female Behçet patients in 13 medical facilities were analyzed in this study. Mantel-Haenszel's odds ratio method and stepwise logistic regression analysis were applied to evaluate the influence of quality of life on subjective life satisfaction in Behçet disease patients. Males had higher problem scores than females in the following: physical condition, daily living activities, working condition, economic status, social status, marriage status, mental status. With regard to the effect on subjective life satisfaction, physical condition, daily living activities, working phase, economic phase, social phase, marriage relations, mental phase showed significantly high odds ratio in male, while physical condition, working phase, economic phase, social phase, medical phase, marriage relations, mental phase showed significantly high odds ratios in females by Mantel-Haenzel age-adjusted method. Physical condition, daily living activities, working phase, economic phase, social phase, and mental phase showed significantly high odds ratios in males after adjusting for active disease symptom periods, while physical condition, working phase, economic phase, social phase, medical phase, marriage relations, mental phase showed significantly high odds ratio in females after adjusting for active disease symptom. By stepwise logistic regression analysis, working phase and mental phase in males, economic phase and mental phase in females were shown to be significant. Improvement of quality of life including mental phase and working phase appear to raise the life satisfaction in Behçet's disease patients.
