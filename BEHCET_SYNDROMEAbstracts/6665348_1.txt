Venous thrombosis occurred frequently in Behçet's disease. In 12 patients with Behçet's disease of whom 6 have had leg venous thrombosis, some parameters of hemostasis or fibrinolysis have been studied. Platelet count, fibrinogen level, factor VIII coagulant activity, factor VIII antigen, plasminogen and antithrombin III level were in the normal range. Fibrinolytic capacity in response to venous occlusion of the arms was the same in patients and in healthy subjects, in the patients, there was no difference in regard to the occurrence of venous thrombosis. These parameters seemed therefore not able to detect the thrombotic tendency in this disease. These results are discussed with the other reports of the literature.
