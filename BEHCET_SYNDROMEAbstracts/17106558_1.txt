Behcet's disease BD may involve in any large or small artery, vein. We present a case of BD with multiple venous thromboses, cardiac and pulmonary involvements, and renal failure. A 22-year-old man admitted with progressive dyspnea and edema on his face and neck. He had the history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, and pustular skin lesions for 4 years. Doppler ultrasonography revealed right internal jugular vein thrombosis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a pericardial effusion, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. While his symptoms were regressing moderately with a pulse cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, and low molecular weight heparin treatment, new thromboses occurred in vena cava inferior, and bilateral renal veins after the third and 7th dosages of pulse cyclophosphamide. Creatinine levels increased progressively, which required hemodialysis. However, he died after the second session of hemodialysis. Patients with BD should be followed up for new developing thrombosis even during an immunosuppressive treatment.
