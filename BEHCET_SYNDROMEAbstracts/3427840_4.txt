Among 50 patients with recurrent oral ulceration (ROU) the prevalence of HLA B5 was not increased as was the case among 50 patients with Beh√ßet's Syndrome (BS) compared to 52 healthy controls. On the other hand, HLA DR4 was present in 16 of 30 (53%) patients with ROU whereas the same allele was present in 16% of BS patients and 22% of the healthy controls. These findings suggest that ROU and BS are not in the same disease spectrum.
