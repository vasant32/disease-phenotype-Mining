We present a case of Behcet's syndrome with unusual pulmonary manifestations. A woman presented five years previously with oral, genital and ocular lesions found on biopsy to be consistent with Behcet's syndrome. While on prednisolone, she complained of nonpleuritic chest pain. Clinical features of active Behcet's syndrome were absent. A previously normal chest x-ray film showed multiple intrapulmonary lesions. Laboratory abnormalities were consistent with findings seen in phases of disease activity. Bronchoscopy showed ulceration of the bronchial mucosa, but no evidence of opportunistic infection or neoplasia. Pulmonary angiography excluded vaso-occlusive abnormalities. A provisional diagnosis of pulmonary involvement with Behcet's syndrome was made and the patient responded to further immunosuppressive therapy.
