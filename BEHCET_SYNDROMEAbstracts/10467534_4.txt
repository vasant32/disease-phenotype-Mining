Behçet disease is a rare condition in central Europe but more common in Morocco. A case of multiple intracranial arterial aneurysms occurring in a 44 year-old Moroccan patient with 2-years history of Behçet's disease is reported. CT-scan showed an infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Panangiography showed sacciform aneurysms of the bifurcation of the right and left middle cerebral arteries. The draining veins and sinuses were normal. The two aneurysms were successfully clipped by two microsurgical frontotemporal approach in one surgical time. There have been only eight reports of intracranial arterial aneurysms associated to Behçet disease in the literature.
