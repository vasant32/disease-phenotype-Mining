PURPOSE: To compare the optic disc topography of patients with ocular Behçet's disease (BD) with age-matched controls, using Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT). METHODS: This study included 32 patients (51 eyes) with ocular BD (active and/or inactive), 38 patients (74 eyes) with nonocular BD, and 62 normal subjects (62 eyes). All patients and control group underwent complete ophthalmologic evaluation. Intraocular pressure was less than 22 mmHg in patients and in the control group. The optic nerve heads of all subjects were imaged with the HRT (software 2.01a-M). The following stereometric parameters were calculated for each patient: disc area, cup area, cup/disc area ratio, rim area, height variation contour, cup volume, rim volume, mean cup depth, cup shape measure, mean RNFL thickness, and RNFL cross-sectional area. Differences among the groups were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis. When the Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference between groups, multiple comparison tests were used to find out which groups differed from which others. RESULTS: The mean disc area was significantly smaller (P<0.05) in patients with ocular and nonocular BD. The mean cup area, mean cup depth, and mean cup volume were significantly smaller (P<0.05) in patients with ocular BD. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of the other stereometric parameters (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: A small disc and cup may be an additional risk factor for retinal vaso-occlusion in ocular Behçet's disease.
