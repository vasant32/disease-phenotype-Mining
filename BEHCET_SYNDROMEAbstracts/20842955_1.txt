In the course of heart failure, plasmatic levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are high and are related to prognosis and mortality. Infliximab, a recombinant chimeric antibody anti-TNF-alpha, was used in heart failure with disappointing results, similar to those obtained with other biological drugs.The aim of this study was the echocardiographic evaluation of infliximab infusion in nine patients without cardiac pathologies. The findings demonstrate a reduction of sistolic function and a modification of diastolic function after infliximab infusion in patients without cardiopathy. This study confirms the protective role played by TNFalpha on the myocardium, as suggested by previous experimental studies.
