 PURPOSE: To report our experience with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injections for the treatment of sight-threatening vitritis. DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: Three patients with acute severe exacerbations of noninfectious panuveitis and vitritis were treated with IVTA injections alone or as an adjunct to systemic immunosuppressive agents. RESULTS: Rapid clearance of the vitreous inflammation with improvement in visual acuity was observed 1 to 2 weeks after injection. The effect lasted 2 to 6 months, with the shortest duration in the vitrectomized eye of Patient 1. Repeated injections were required in all patients. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide may be beneficial in selected cases of vitritis. This treatment modality has a rapid effect and may lower the use of systemic agents.
