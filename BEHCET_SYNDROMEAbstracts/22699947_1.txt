The etiology and pathogenesis of Behçet's syndrome remains unclear. It has been postulated that an infectious agent may induce an immune-mediated, generalized vasculitis in genetically predisposed individuals (HLA-B51 +). There is accumulating evidence that an abnormality of the innate and adaptive immune response, e.g. directed against heat shock proteins plays an important role in Behçet's syndrome. This article is intended to evaluate the more recent knowledge on this disorder and evaluate new therapeutic options.
