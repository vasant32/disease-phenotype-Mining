Colchicine is one of the oldest drugs known to us. During the last few years, it has been increasingly applied in the treatment of systemic dermatoses. Particularly in dermatoses mediated by neutrophils, colchicine has settled among other therapies. With regard to Beh√ßet's disease, it has even become the treatment of choice. The present review deals with further dermatological disorders sensitive to colchicine; in addition, we mention those dermatoses which do not show any therapeutic response to colchicine. The treatment with colchicine requires profound knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and mode of action regarding this substance, as well as the possible side effects. This knowledge allows safe and responsible treatment with colchicine. It has to be considered, however, that in the Federal Republic of Germany colchicine has not been registered for dermatological indications yet.
