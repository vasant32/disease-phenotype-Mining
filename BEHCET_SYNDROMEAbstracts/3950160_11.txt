Computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) studies were done in one case of Behcet disease and showed a focal lesion in the upper brain stem. Early institution of therapy was followed by a complete clinical remission and disappearance of the CT and MR changes. Computed tomography and MR are important modalities for the early detection of Behcet disease when reversibility of the pathological changes is still possible.
