Anti-tetanus antibody status was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 82 patients with Behçet's disease and 79 healthy individuals. 76 patients with Behçet's disease (92.7%) and 74 healthy controls (93.7%) had protective antibody titres against tetanus, with geometric mean levels of 1.0194 +/- 1.2755 and 1.3899 +/- 1.6533 IU/ml, respectively. The difference between the 2 groups was not statistically significant. There was a significant inverse correlation between antitoxin titres and age in patient and control groups. These findings imply that patients with Behçet's disease have intact overall immunity against tetanus.
