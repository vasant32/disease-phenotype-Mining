We report a case of a patient with longstanding Behçet disease, with neurological symptoms predominantly, who became hospitalized for adrenal insufficiency, caused by isolated deficiency of corticotropin (DAACTH). DAACTH is a typical characteristic of hypophysitis, reported in association with many autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, hypothalamic-pituitary injury in Behçet disease is exceptional. We review the literature and possible mechanisms of this association until now not reported.
