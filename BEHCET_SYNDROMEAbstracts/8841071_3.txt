Only rarely can the development of subretinal foveal or parafoveal neovascularization be observed in patients with chronic uveitis. We report herein the clinical characteristics pertaining to neovascular membranes and the treatment thereof in 3 patients afflicted with either sarcoidosis (2 patients) or Beh√ßet syndrome (1 patient). Peroral steroids contributed to a reduction of neovascular membranes in 1 patient with sarcoidosis. The management of uveitis is mandatory for the prevention of subretinal foveal neovascular membranes.
