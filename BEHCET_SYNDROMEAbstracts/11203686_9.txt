OBJECTIVES: to retrospectively evaluate the role of vascular interventions in Behçet's disease with arterial involvement. So far, little information is available on the surgical approach for arterial involvement in Behçet's disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: between February 1989 and August 1997, among 178 patients with Behçet's disease referred to our clinic, vascular involvement was established in total of 67 patients (38%) which consisted of 59 venous (33%) and 12 (7%) arterial involvements requiring urgent surgical intervention. Primary arterial lesions were occlusive in one patient, aneurysm formation in nine or both in four. RESULTS: twelve primary operations and 12 reoperations were performed. The reasons for reoperations were anastomotic aneurysms, graft occlusion, occlusion of native vessel, graft infection, bleeding from anastomosis and aortoenteric fistula. First reoperation was performed after a mean period of 6.4 months (1-15 months). Postoperative follow-up was 12-60 months (mean 36 months) and three patients died during follow-up.  CONCLUSIONS: the   surgical results were not satisfactory because of progressive graft thrombosis and formation   of new aneurysms at the anastomosis. Aggressive medical treatment should be combined   when major vessel involvement occurs. All types of arterial punctures for angiography or   blood gases should be minimised because of the risk of new aneurysm formation. Surgical   intervention is indicated only in patients with a growing aneurysm, acute rupture or severe   ischaemia.
