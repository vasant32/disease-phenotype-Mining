A variety of cutaneous lesions may occur in Behçet's disease (BD) both at presentation and over the course of the disease. Skin involvement of the hands and feet has been infrequently observed. We describe a patient with BD with recurrent, multiple, papulonodular cutaneous lesions affecting the palm and fingers of both hands, occurring simultaneously with aphthous stomatitis. The lesions consisted of roundish, erythematous, painful, bluish-red nodules, 0.5-1 cm in diameter, with a "pernio-like" aspect. Histologic examination revealed perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates. We suggest that cutaneous lesions with a pernio-like aspect as observed in our patient may be included in the spectrum of the cutaneous manifestations of Behçet's disease.
