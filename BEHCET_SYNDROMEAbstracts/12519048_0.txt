BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is a heterogeneous pathological entity of unknown etiology, most of the time affecting many organs concurrently. CASES: We report two cases of women who presented with ulcerations of the vulvar area as the first symptom, highlighting the diagnostic difficulties that were encountered until the diagnosis of Behçet's disease was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Behçet's disease should be kept in mind as a part of the differential diagnosis of vulvar ulcers.
