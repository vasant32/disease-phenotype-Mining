We investigated the concentration of tacrolimus in aqueous humor, and serum of patients with ocular Behçet's disease after topical application in 11 patients. All received 1 drop of isotonic tacrolimus solution 0.3% every 6 hours for 3 days. The mean tacrolimus concentration in the aqueous and serum, as measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay, were 12.49 and 0.76 ng/mL, respectively. Tacrolimus may be a promising treatment modality in anterior uveitis in Behçet's disease by topical application.
