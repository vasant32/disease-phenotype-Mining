We experienced 8 cases who required reoperations, including 2 re-redo operations, after repairs of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. Of 8 patients, one patient developed a new aneurysm due to atherosclerosis in thoraco-abdominal aorta involving all visceral arteries and other 7 patients had aneurysmal formations at proximal anastomotic sites, including 3 suprarenal, 2 juxtarenal and 2 infrarenal aortic lesions. Etiology at initial operation in patients who subsequently developed anastomotic aneurysms included vasculo-Behçet disease in 4, atherosclerosis in 2 and dissecting aortic aneurysms type III due to Marfan syndrome in 1. At reoperation, all who had vasculo-Behçet disease had ruptures of anastomotic sites and 2 patients underwent repairs of dehiscent patch, 1 extra-anatomic bypass between ascending and abdominal aorta and 1 interposition of graft. One patient who had graft infection after repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm required axillo-femoral bypass with removal of infected graft. A patient who had dehiscence of proximal anastomosis after repair of aortoiliac occlusive disease required interposition of graft. Two patients, Marfan syndrome and aneurysm in thoraco-abdominal aorta, underwent graft replacement of thoraco-abdominal aorta concomitant with reconstruction of all visceral arteries. There were 8 patients who required reoperations for aneurysms at distal anastomotic sites after repairs of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Five patients underwent repairs of new aneurysms, including replacement of total arch in 3, descending aorta in 1 and iliac artery in 1. In all cases, no hospital death was noted, however, late deaths were occurred in vasculo-Behçet disease, Marfan syndrome and graft infection. Thus, late result depends on etiology of disease. Although patients who requires reoperation after repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms have higher operative risk factors, early and late results are satisfactory compared to initial operations.
