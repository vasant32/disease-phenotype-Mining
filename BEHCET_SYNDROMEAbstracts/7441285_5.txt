The myopathology of Behçet's disease is described in 7 patients using conventional light microscopy, histochemistry, high-resolution light microscopy and electron microscopy. Two patients had clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy: 5 patients had no clinical evidence of neuromuscular involvement. Histochemical profile of muscle in all patients was normal. Abnormalities in muscle histology using conventional light microscopy were found in only 1 patient. High-resolution light microscopy revealed abnormalities in 3 patients whereas electron microscopy revealed abnormalities in muscle of all 7 patients. The myopathology of Behçet's disease includes thickening of capillary basement membrane, excessive pleating of sarcolemma, subsarcolemmal aggregates of mitochondria and glycogen, disorganization and breakdown of myofibrils, central nucleation and the presence of a variety of cytoplasmic inclusions. No virus particles were present.
