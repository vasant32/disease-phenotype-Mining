To evaluate plasma lipid peroxidation and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems in patients with Behçet's disease, plasma malondialdehyde levels and total antioxidant status, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and whole blood glutathione peroxidase activities were studied in 15 patients with active disease and in 30 with inactive disease, and compared with 20 age-matched healthy control subjects. Plasma malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in patients with active Behçet's disease than in patients with inactive disease, who had significantly higher levels than control subjects. The plasma total antioxidant status of both groups of patients was significantly lower than that of controls. Furthermore, whole blood glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in patients with active versus inactive Behçet's disease. There were no significant differences in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase levels between the groups. In conclusion, there is an increase in oxidative stress in Behçet's disease. Despite this stress, the antioxidant system is deficient and inadequate, especially in patients who are in an active phase of the disease.
