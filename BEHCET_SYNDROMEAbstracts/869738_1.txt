A case of Behcet's disease in a pregnant patient is reported. The patient showed central nervous system involvement as well eyes, mouth, external genitalia and skin lesions. The neurological signs were cranial nerves palsies and pyramidal tract involvement. The cerebrospinal fluid showed hypercytosis and hyper-gammaglobulin. The patient was treated with sistemic dexamethasone and eye drops of atropine and fluorometolone. The delivery was by elective cesarean section at 8th and a half month of pregnancy. In the examination of 6 month-old the infant was normal. The patient improved but remained with important visual loss. The authors think that the pregnancy helped the partial recovery and the good evolution; similar cases have been reported in the literature. A rapid review about the central nervous system involvement and treatment of Beh√ßet's disease is made.
