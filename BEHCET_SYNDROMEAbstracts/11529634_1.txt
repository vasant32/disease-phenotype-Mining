We report the case of a patient with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and recurrent venous thrombosis in the right subclavian vein, successfully treated with balloon dilatation and the insertion of a Wallstent. Subsequent follow up at 6 months showed no evidence of reocclusion. Endovascular stents should be considered as a possible interventional modality in BD patients with aneurysms or recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis.
