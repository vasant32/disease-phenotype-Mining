Behçet's disease is a rare condition in children and characterized by a triad of recurrent aphthous stomatitis, genital ulceration and uveitis. The aetiology is unknown, but systemic vasculitis is the main pathology. The oral lesions resemble Sutton disease, which is another form of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) that composes approximately 10 per cent of cases and is known as major aphthous stomatitis, can easily be overlooked if the other symptoms are not questioned. We presented a 12-year-old girl with the initial complaint of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. During the follow-up period, we observed the other cardinal signs of the Behçet's disease.
