Behcet's disease, though originally described as a triad of oral and genital aphthous ulcers and inflammatory ocular lesions, has had several new elements added to its description. The updated syndrome now includes gastrointestinal (GI) involvement as well as polyarthritis, neuritis, myocarditis, and glomerulonephritis. Of particular importance to the surgeon are the GI manifestations that include hemorrhage and perforation. A review of the literature indicates that the GI manifestations of Behcet's disease are not uncommon and, though usually mild, may necessitate surgical intervention. Our experience with a patient with GI hemorrhage and subsequent perforation underlines the occasional urgent complications of this disease.
