 BACKGROUND: The US FDA-approved thalidomide for the treatment of chronic recurrent/severe erythema nodosum leprosum. Thalidomide is also useful in many other inflammatory dermatological conditions where patients have exhausted other treatment options. METHODS: The beneficial and adverse clinical effects of thalidomide were studied in 25 patients suffering from different inflammatory dermatological conditions that were poorly controlled with conventional therapies. RESULTS: Thalidomide was found to be effective in various inflammatory dermatological diseases other than chronic recurrent erythema nodosum leprosum such as Beh√ßet's disease, disseminated and hypertrophic discoid lupus erythematosus, erosive lichen planus, discoid lupus erythematosus-lichen planus overlap, recurrent aphthous stomatitis and prurigo nodularis. Deep vein thrombosis due to thalidomide occurred in 20% of these patients and appears to be a significant side effect. CONCLUSION: Thalidomide appears promising in a number of inflammatory dermatological conditions and will probably find new usages in future. The treating physicians need to be wary of the thrombo-embolic complications due to thalidomide especially when glucocorticoids or other chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil or dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse therapy are being used concomitantly, and in patients of metastatic renal carcinoma, myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma receiving thalidomide/chemotherapy. Antiphospholipid or anticardiolipin antibodies appear to be other possible risk factors for this complication.
