The case of a 16-year-old woman with typical clinical features of acute vulval ulcer, Lipschutz's disease, is reported. The main differential diagnoses are discussed. Isolated vulval ulcer can reveal a recurrent aphthous ulcer, Beh√ßet's disease or Crohn's disease. In contrast, acute vulval ulcer spontaneously heals with no recurrence, that must be taken into account for diagnosis.
