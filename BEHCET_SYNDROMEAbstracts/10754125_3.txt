A 21-year-old man with Behçet's syndrome presented with both a left ventricular aneurysm and a left renal artery pseudoaneurysm. After successful embolization of the ruptured pseudoaneurysm, the patient underwent successful repair of the left ventricular aneurysm. Although multiple aneurysms have been reported previously, we believe this to be the first reported case of both a ventricular aneurysm and a renal artery pseudoaneurysm afflicting a patient with Behçet's syndrome.
