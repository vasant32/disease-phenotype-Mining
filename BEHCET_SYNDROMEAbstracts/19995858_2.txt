 OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of being free of major organ involvement during the early years of the disease on the prognosis of men with Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS). METHODS: Ninety-six men with BS, who had only active mucocutaneous manifestations when entering a controlled trial of thalidomide mean (s.d.) 11.7 (0.8) years ago, were re-evaluated for the use of immunosuppressives as an indication of major organ involvement during the post-trial period. RESULTS: Outcome information was obtained in 91 (95%) patients. Thirty-nine (43%) patients had to use immunosuppressives during the post-trial period. Immunosuppressive use was significantly more frequent among patients developing BS at younger age (76%; <or=24 years) than older age (30%; >or=25 years). Developing BS at young age (OR = 6.3; 95% CI 2.09, 19.04) and not using colchicine during the post-trial period (OR = 3.860; 95% CI 1.484, 10.034) were risk factors for immunosuppressive use. However, 82% of the patients using colchicine had onset during old age. Colchicine showed a significant effect in decreasing the use of immunosuppressives only among patients of old age at onset (Fisher's exact test = 5.026; P = 0.031) in the subgroup analysis. Eye disease (18 patients) and vascular involvement (14 patients) were the most frequent indications for immunosuppressive use. CONCLUSIONS: Being free of major organ involvement during the early years of BS does not indicate a mild prognosis for men developing BS at young age. Whether colchicine will reduce the need for immunosuppressive use among men developing BS at old age awaits formal studies.
