Behçet's disease frequently involves the venous system, usually affecting small vessels, but sometimes large vessels such as the vena cava. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is associated with an increased incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis. A 29-year-old male with Behçet's disease developed bilateral leg edema secondary to thrombotic occlusion of the inferior vena cava. Laboratory tests revealed positive antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. Treatment with steroid and warfarin subsequent to intravenous administration of uro-kinase resulted in improvement of symptoms. The association of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and Behçet's disease may have caused the total thrombotic occlusion of the vena cava in this case.
