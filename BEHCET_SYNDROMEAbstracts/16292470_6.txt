The aim of this study is to describe the clinical features of Lebanese patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) followed up at a tertiary care center in Lebanon. A retrospective review of medical records of 90 patients who fulfilled the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for diagnosis was performed. The clinical characteristics and severity score were compared with those reported from other populations of Arab and of Turkish origin using the same diagnostic criteria, and a comparison over two decades for the Lebanese population was made. The male-to-female ratio was 2.9:1, the mean age at onset, 25.4 years, and mean age at diagnosis, 29.2 years. One hundred percent of the patients had mouth ulceration; 72.2%, genital ulceration; 59.1%, arthritis; 55.7%, papulopustular skin lesion; 53.9%, ocular disease; 36.8%, vascular disease; 29.5%, erythema nodosum; and 23.0%, neurologic disease. The characteristics of our patient population are similar to that reported from other countries in the region. However, we found a higher prevalence of vascular and neurologic disease.
