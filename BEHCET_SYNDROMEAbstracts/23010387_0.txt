 OBJECTIVES: Recent reports suggest efficacy of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) therapy in Behçet's disease. However, the switching of anti-TNF-α agents for treatment failure remains unexplored. Our aims were to describe the efficacy and safety of a second anti-TNF-α agent in Behçet's disease patients after failure of a first agent. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, 34 Behçet's disease patients receiving anti-TNF-α agents, 19 of whom switched to a second anti-TNF-α agent, were identified. We assessed the response to anti-TNF-α agents, the duration of anti-TNF-α therapy, the reasons for withdrawal, adverse events, the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF), C-reactive protein (CRP), ESR and concomitant therapies at the onset of the first and second anti-TNF-α therapies, and after 6, 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Clinical improvements were seen in 26/34 (76%) after the first and 18/19 (95%) after the second anti-TNF-α agent. Continuation rates at 24 months were 14.4% after the first and 22.3% after the second anti-TNF-α agent. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was secondary failure in both groups (12 after the first anti-TNF-α agent and 8 after the second). Adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal were seen in 10 after the first anti-TNF-α agent and three after the second. CONLUSIONS: The second anti-TNF-α agent in Behçet's disease demonstrated similar efficacy to that seen with the first agent without new safety concerns, supporting switching to a second anti-TNF-α agent. However, long-term continuation rates for anti-TNF-α therapy were low after both the first and second agents.
