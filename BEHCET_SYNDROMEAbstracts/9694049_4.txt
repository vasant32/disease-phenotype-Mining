The plasma levels of thrombomodulin (TM) in 34 patients with Beh√ßet's disease and 79 healthy control subjects were studied. Eight patients had the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation. The TM level was significantly lower in patients with the FVL mutation than in patients without the mutation and in the healthy controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). However, there was no difference in overall mean plasma TM concentration between the patients without the mutation and the healthy controls.
