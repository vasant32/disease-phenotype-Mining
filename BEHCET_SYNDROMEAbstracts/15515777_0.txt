Behçet's disease is associated with the inflammatory response. Several reports indicate the presence of primarily CD4+ T cells of the Th1 subtype in the inflammation process of the disease. Serum soluble CD30 (sCD30) is reported to be released from CD4+ Th2 type cells and has been suggested to be a marker of Th2 activity. In this study, serum sCD30 levels were measured in active and inactive patients with Behçet's disease, healthy controls and a group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, typical Th1 disorder using enzyme immunoassay kit. Mean sCD30 value of 54 active patients were found significantly higher than in those of 17 inactive patients (p = 0.027), 20 healthy controls (p = 0.040) and 25 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between increased sCD30 levels and clinical activity index in active patients with Behçet's disease. High serum levels of sCD30 may reflect the activation of CD4+ T cells or a subset of them in active BD patients. In addition to serum sCD30 levels, measurements of the Th2 cytokines may be a helpful tool for the evaluation of Th2 activity in Behçet's disease.
