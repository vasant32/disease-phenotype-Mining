The concept that autoimmunity may damage the inner ear was introduced by McCabe in 1979. Audiovestibular symptoms may occur in isolation or may be mediated by vasculitis in patients affected by systemic autoimmune disorders. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is typical in Cogan's syndrome but occurs less frequently in Be√ßhet's syndrome and in systemic necrotizing vasculitides. Patients affected by immune-mediated profound SNHL represent ideal candidates for cochlear implantation as these patients become deaf after years of hearing. The disease itself and the medication taken may, however, influence the prognosis of cochlear implantation in these patients. We retrospectively evaluated the pre- and intraoperative findings as well as the postoperative course and performance of a group of five patients affected by a systemic vasculitis syndrome who received a cochlear implant. Implantation was successful in all patients, no complications occurred and excellent postoperative speech perception was achieved. We conclude that cochlear implantation in patients affected by immune-mediated inner ear disorders is effective although the long-term results remain to be evaluated.
