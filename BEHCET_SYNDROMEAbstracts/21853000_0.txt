The present report concerns a young woman with long-standing Beh√ßet disease (BD), who developed sarcoidosis and myasthaenia gravis (MG)-like syndrome. Although an itching sensation after intravenous methylprednisolone made treatment more difficult, low-dose oral methylprednisolone, thalidomide and ciclosporin A relieved the chronic granulomatous inflammation and pyridostigmine controlled the ptosis.
