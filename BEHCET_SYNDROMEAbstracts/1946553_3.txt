Vasculitis is accepted to be the basis of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) which is a multisystem disease, and the arachidonic acid(AA) metabolites acting as balancing mediators in the organism are accepted to be responsible for the vasculitis. In this study, we examined the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) levels of the patients with BD before and after colchicine therapy. We found a statistical decrease in the PGE2 and LTC4 levels after colchicine therapy compared to the previous levels, concluding that colchicine inhibits the inflammation and the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PML) chemotaxis by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways.
