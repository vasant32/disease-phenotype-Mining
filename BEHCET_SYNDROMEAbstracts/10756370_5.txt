Thrombosis occurs in 20 to 30% of patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD), but the precise pathogenic mechanism underlying the thrombotic tendency in these patients is not well known. Venous thromboses are commonly located in the lower extremities, but right intracardiac thrombi are extremely rare. We report for the first time on a young patient with BD associated the 20210G-A prothrombin gene mutation and right intracardiac thrombosis. We suggest that the association of BD with this newly recognized prothrombotic genetic mutation may have contributed to the development of the thrombotic event in this patient.
