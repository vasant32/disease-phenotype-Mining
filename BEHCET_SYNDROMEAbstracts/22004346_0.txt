Behçet's disease, a systemic vasculitis, can cause varying degrees of activity limitation, fatigue and quality of life impairment. To date, there have been no studies regarding sleep disturbance and its relationship with fatigue and life quality in Behçet's disease. We aimed to evaluate sleep disorders and polysomnographic parameters, and to determine their relationship with fatigue and quality of life in Behçet's disease. Fifty-one patients with Behçet's disease without any neurological involvement were interviewed regarding sleep disorders. Twenty-one subjects with no sleep complaints were included as the control group. Sleep-related complaints were evaluated in a face-to-face interview. Sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, depression, anxiety, disease activity/severity, and quality of life questionnaires and an overnight polysomnography were performed. Prevalences of restless legs syndrome (35.3%) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with/without other sleep disorders (32.5%) were higher than in the control group and the general population. Fatigue was higher in patients with restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and in those with lower minimum oxygen saturation; hence, only patients with restless legs syndrome had quality of life impairment. Sleep efficiency index and sleep continuity index were lower, and wake after sleep onset, respiratory disturbance index and apnea-hypopnea index were higher than in controls (P < 0.01). Neither sleep disorders nor polysomnographic parameters were related to disease activity and severity. In conclusion, it is important to question sleep disorder followed by a polysomnography, if necessary, in order to improve quality of life and fatigue in Behçet's disease.
