The aims of the present study were to evaluate the prevalence of headache and the frequency of different headache syndromes in patients with Beh√ßet's Disease (BD) without neurological involvement and to investigate the relationship with other clinical, and behavioural variables. Twenty-seven BD patients and 27 control subjects underwent a validated semistructured questionnaire based on the International Headache Society criteria. Levels of anxiety and depression, disease activity, and current medication were collected. Headache occurred in 88.9% of BD patients. There was no difference in the prevalence of the different headache syndromes between BD patients and controls. Only migraine without aura (MwA) was significantly more frequent in BD patients than controls (44.4% vs. 11.1%, respectively, P= 0.013). No relationship was found between MwA and clinical, and behavioural variables. Among headache syndromes, MwA showed the highest frequency in BD. A vascular or neuronal subclinical dysfunction could justify this association. A careful interview for migraine might be included in the diagnostic work-up of BD.
