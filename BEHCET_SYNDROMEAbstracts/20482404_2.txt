 PURPOSE: To describe the clinical outcome of refractory ocular Behçet disease with adalimumab therapy. METHOD: Retrospective review of records. RESULTS: Twenty-one eyes of 11 male patients with ocular Behçet disease received adalimumab therapy. Of the 21 eyes, 17 had improvement of visual acuity by more than 3 lines after the average follow-up of 10.8 months. Ten out of 11 patients showed complete resolution of inflammation by 4 weeks. The dosages of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs were reduced in most of the patients and stopped altogether in 3 and 6 patients, respectively. One patient on infliximab showed improvement of inflammation after switching over to adalimumab. No serious side effects were observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: Adalimumab appears to be effective in Behçet disease. It has been shown to improve visual acuity and also to have a corticosteroid and immunosuppressive sparing effect. It can induce and maintain sustained remission of the disease.
