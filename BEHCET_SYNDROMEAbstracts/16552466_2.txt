Behcet's disease is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized commonly by oral and genital ulcerations, with skin and eye involvement. Unlike other manifestations, involvement of the central nervous system and vascular manifestations can be late in the course and are the leading causes of death. Aneurysms are relatively common in visceral vessels but extremely rare in intracranial arteries, being limited to few case reports. Moreover, vascular involvement is significantly less common in female than in male patients. In this paper, we report a case of aneurysm of internal carotid artery in a female patient of Behcet's disease who had presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and was treated successfully by a brief course of corticosteroids followed by endovascular treatment.
