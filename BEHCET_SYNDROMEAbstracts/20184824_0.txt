Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing multisystem inflammatory disorder, vasculitis being its major pathological feature. It is prevalent in the Orient and areas along the ancient Silk Road, but very rare among North European Caucasians. Neurological involvement is relatively uncommon. The diagnosis of neuro-Behçet can be difficult to establish if the mucocutaneous involvement is incomplete, absent, or unattended. We present an exceptional case of neuro-Behçet in a 38-year-old Caucasian Danish woman. On account of the risk of serious complication, it is important to make the diagnosis as soon as possible.
