BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. Recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with Behçet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Behçet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. Plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. Serum IgG antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. RESULTS: Significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with Behçet's disease compared to healthy subjects (P <0.0001). Antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with Behçet's disease than in controls (P <0.001-0.05). In contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 compared to controls (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with Behçet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. Decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in Behçet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.
