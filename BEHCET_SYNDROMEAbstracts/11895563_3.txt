A 37-year-old female presenting with oral and genital ulcers and erythema nodosum on both arms was diagnosed as having Behçet's disease. The symptoms resolved spontaneously. However, she was admitted to our hospital (Keio University Hospital) several months later because of fever, aphthous ulcers of the oral cavity, lower abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea. A colonoscopic examination revealed multiple ulcers including longitudinal ulcers in the ascending and transverse colon, and histological examination of biopsied specimens demonstrated non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. Treatment with prednisolone and 5-aminosalicylic acid was started, and the patient responded well clinically. One month later, a repeated colonoscopy confirmed that the lesions including longitudinal ulcers had disappeared. In this report, we describe our experience of this rare case of Behçet's disease concomitant with colonic longitudinal ulcers and epithelioid granuloma, and discuss the difficulties in making a differential diagnosis, primarily with regard to Crohn's disease.
