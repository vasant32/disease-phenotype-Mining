Pathological and pathophysiological study on the intestinal lymphatics was carried out clinically and experimentally. Jejunal biopsy study revealed marked dilatation of intestinal lymphatics in liver cirrhosis with ascites and Beh√ßet's disease as well as protein-losing enteropathy. Lymphangiographic study showed also abnormal findings in above-mentioned diseases. In cases of McKee dogs in which mechanism of blockade of lymphatic flow was already clarified, McKee dogs showed marked malabsorptive of fat. When lymphatic flow was blocked mechanically at the thoracic duct, fat accumulation was seen in the absorptive cells as well as in dilated intestinal lymphatics. In administration of colchicine to rats, fat accumulation was seen in the matrix of absorptive cells as well as in the endoplasmic reticulums and Golgi apparatus. However, amorphous substances instead of chylomicrons were seen in dilated intestinal lymphatics. These studies suggested that a tract of fat transportation from intestinal cells to the thoracic duct should be considered as a functional unit in fat absorption.
