The patient is a 30-year-old man who has suffered from recurrent attacks of tonsilitis, oral aphthae and scrotal ulcerations, erythema nodosum and thrombophlebitis. In April, 1980, he gradually developed headache and visual disturbance. On April 14, 1980, he was pointed out remarked bilateral choked disc by an ophthalmologist and then admitted to the Miyazaki Medical College Hospital. On admission to our service, he showed atypical symptoms of Behçet's disease, namely, oral aphthae and scrotal ulcerations, erythema nodosum and bilateral choked disc. Laboratory data demonstrated hyperimmunoglobulinemia, increased clotting factors and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Immunogenetically, HLA BW51 type was demonstrated. The angiograms showed complete obstructions of the superior sagittal sinus and the common trunk of the femoral artery. Histological examination of the skin lesion demonstrated atypical chronic inflammation and thrombophlebitis. A diagnosis of atypical Vasculo-Behçet's disease was made. The response to the steroid therapy was dramatic, though the fibrinolytic drugs, anticoagulants and vasodilators were not effective. Thrombophlebitis is a well recognized complication of Behçet's disease occurring in major vessels, however thrombosis of the dural sinus has rarely reported. This case may be the first one which had superior sagittal sinus thrombosis with Vasculo-Behçet's disease in literature. We discussed the mechanism of the thrombogenesis, the relationship to HLA, the coexistence of Neuro-Behçet's disease and the therapy of Vasculo-Behçet's disease.
