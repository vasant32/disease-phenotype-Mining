Serum samples from 57 Turkish patients with Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS) were analysed for C-reactive protein, histidine, total sulphydryl concentration and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase. Clinical subgroups did not exhibit biochemical differences, including BS with and without arthritis. When compared with normal controls and with patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), those with BS were shown to be biochemically abnormal in a manner quantitatively similar to RA, but to a lesser degree. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase concentrations were found to be normal in BS.
