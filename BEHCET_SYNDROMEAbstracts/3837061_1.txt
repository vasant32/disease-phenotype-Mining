Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for 10 patients with cardiovascular thrombi using a 0.1-Tesla resistive type apparatus (ASAHI MARK-J). In all cases thrombi were clearly imaged by NMR and their shapes closely resembled those imaged by X-ray CT. Mural thrombi located within left ventricular aneurysms of two patients with old anteroseptal myocardial infarction were semilunar in form. A mural thrombus in the right ventricle of a patient with cardiovascular Behcet's disease was also clearly imaged. Mural thrombi within the enlarged left atrium of two patients with mitral valve stenosis and insufficiency were clearly demonstrated in both cross- and longitudinal sections. In three patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, mural thrombi were recognized within the local dilatations of the aorta. In two patients with dissecting aortic aneurysm, mural thrombi were visualized within false lumen using MRI. Mean T1 values and standard deviations for the left ventricular cavity, the left ventricular wall, and the thrombi were 639 +/- 49, 349 +/- 17 and 316 +/- 84 msec, respectively. Mean T1 values of the thrombi were usually shorter than those of the left ventricular wall. Some supposedly fresh thrombi had longer T1 values, however.
