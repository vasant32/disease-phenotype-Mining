The aim of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of colchicine in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome. Ten patients suffering from Behçet's syndrome were selected for this purpose. The patients were treated with 1 mg/day of colchicine associated with 1 mg of betametasone during the initial florid phase of the disease. After the acute phase, betametasone was withdrawn. The patients were observed for a period ranging from 5 to 23 months. Biochemical and immunological parameters were measured at time 0 and every month in order to monitor the disease and the possible side effects of colchicine. All patients had a satisfactory control of the disease without showing any toxic effect.
