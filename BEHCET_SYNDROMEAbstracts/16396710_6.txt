Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin eruptions and uveitis. Neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems are also involved. Although venous and arterial vasculitis occur in up to one-third of patients, intracardiac thrombus is a very rare complication. We herein report the case of a 46-year-old man with BD who presented with a large right atrial thrombus. Within a month after surgical removal, the thrombus recurred and was successfully treated with immunosuppressants that included prednisolone and cyclophosphamide.
