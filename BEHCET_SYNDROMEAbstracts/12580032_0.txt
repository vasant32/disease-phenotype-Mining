PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between serum SIL-2R levels and uveitis. METHODS: SIL-2R levels were measured in sera of 64 patients with active uveitis by ELISA assay, 61 healthy subjects as control. RESULTS: Serum SIL-2R levels in the patients with active uveitis were significantly higher than that in the controls, but there were no significant difference among anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, Behcet disease and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. After therapy the serum SIL-2R levels were obviously decreased. CONCLUSION: SIL-2R Levels in serum correlate with activity of uveitis.
