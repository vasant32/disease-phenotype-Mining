Two neuro-Behçet patients have been studied, over a period of several months, by means of peroneal and median somatosensory- (SEP), brainstem auditory- (BAEP), and visual- (VEP) evoked potentials. In both patients, peroneal SEP showed evidence of a pathological reduction in the central conduction velocity without a related deep sensation impairment, while VEP changes were consistent with the visual disorders. Conversely, BAEP and median SEP findings did not show disease-related abnormalities. The observed anomalies were detectable irrespective of the clinical phase of the disease. Thus, evoked potential assessment is useful in providing objective evidence for evaluating and monitoring CNS damage in neuro-Behçet's syndrome.
