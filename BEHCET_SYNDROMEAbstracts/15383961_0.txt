Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disease characterized mainly by recurrent episodes of orogenital aphthae and uveitis. In 10-30% of cases relapsing multifocal neurological symptoms occur. The authors present a 54-year-old female patient with the central nervous system manifestation of clinically diagnosed BD. Based on the reported case diagnostic (in particular differential diagnosis with multiple sclerosis) and therapeutic problems of BD are discussed.
