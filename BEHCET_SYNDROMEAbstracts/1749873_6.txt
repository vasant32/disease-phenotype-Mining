A 23-year-old-man was admitted to our department complaining of chest oppression. He had had a diagnosis of intestinal-Behçet because of a 7-year history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, arthritis, cutaneous folliculitis and ulcer in the ileocecal region. Cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion at the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) without aneurysm formation at other coronary trees. During medical follow-up, this case showed vasospastic angina probably associated with active coronary vasculitis. The incidence of vascular involvement in the total number of cases of Behçet's disease reported in the literature is 3.6-7.7%. Overall, thrombophlebitis and arterial aneurysm formation is relatively common and frequently reported in cases of vasculo-Behçet. Our case demonstrated the following uncommon pattern as vasculo-Behçet; 1) initial clinicopathologic manifestation at the coronary artery without any other vascular lesion, 2) abrupt total occlusion (clear cut lesion) at LAD, 3) complication of vasospastic angina, which has not yet been reported in medical literature.
