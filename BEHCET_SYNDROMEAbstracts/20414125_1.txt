We report a patient with an overlap of relapsing polychondritis and Behcet disease whose cartilaginous inflammation and genital lesions were refractory to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, but fully remitted with the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor, infliximab. We believe this case represents the first report of a response to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor in a patient with mouth and genital ulcerations with inflamed cartilage syndrome.
