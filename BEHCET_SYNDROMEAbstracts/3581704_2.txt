The patient, a 55-year-old man with neuro-Behçet, developed superior vena caval occlusion. Antibodies to cardiolipin were detected in high titres in his serum and a decreased fibrinolysis was also found. It is suggested that anticardiolipin antibodies, perhaps decreasing fibrinolysis, may play an important pathogenic role in some patients with Behçet's disease.
