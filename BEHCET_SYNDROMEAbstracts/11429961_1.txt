BACKGROUND: To determine the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of intestinal Behçet's disease. METHODS: Eight patients diagnosed to have intestinal Behçet's disease prospectively underwent MR imaging. Five patients had previously undergone abdominal surgery for intestinal Behçet's disease 27-81 months previously. Breath-hold T2-weighted single-shot fast spin echo, T1-weighted multiplanar spoiled gradient recalled echo, and postgadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted opposed-phase multiplanar spoiled gradient recalled echo images were obtained. MR findings were analyzed by three independent radiologists in terms of the presence and location of bowel wall thickening and ulcer, maximal bowel wall thickness, grade of bowel wall enhancement, and presence and nature of extraluminal manifestations. K statistics were used to evaluate interobserver variability. RESULTS: Seven cases (88%), including the five cases with previous operations, demonstrated bowel thickening of more than 9 mm and increased enhancement. Ulcer was depicted in four cases (50%) in the terminal ileum or an anastomosis site. Three cases (38%) showed extraluminal manifestation, such as mesenteric infiltration around the involved bowel (two cases) and a sinus tract to subhepatic abscess from perforation (one case). CONCLUSION: Breath-hold MR imaging is useful for the evaluation of bowel wall thickening, enhancement, mesentery infiltration, and abscess formation. Characteristic ulcerative lesions may be also depicted on T1- and T2-weighted breath-hold images. MR imaging is a useful method for postoperative follow-up study for the evaluation of recurrence.
