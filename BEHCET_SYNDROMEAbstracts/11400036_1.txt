We report three patients who collectively have very representative clinical forms of neuro-Behçet and different neurological findings. The first case, male, 49 years old, presents symptoms similar to multiple sclerosis. The second case, male 15 years old, presents with parenchymatous compromise and an association with antiphospholipid antibody. And the third case, female 25 years old, presents an acute meningitis. Neuro-Behçet must always be included as a differential diagnosis of neurological disorders that have any difficulties in establishing a definite diagnosis.
