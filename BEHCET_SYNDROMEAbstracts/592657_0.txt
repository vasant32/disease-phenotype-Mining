Report on the results of immunsuppressive therapy in 6 patients with Beh√ßet's disease. A combined regimen of azathioprine and cortisone improved the course of the disease and diminished the number of recidives. In order to prevent irreversible damage to the eye early immunosuppressive therapy is advocated. Because of possible side-effects of azathioprine the necessity of further treatment should be reevaluated after several months without symptoms and then gradually terminated.
