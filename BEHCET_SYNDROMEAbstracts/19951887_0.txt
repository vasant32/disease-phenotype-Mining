A 75-year-old man presented with painful oral and groin ulcers. The lack of any infections and the location of the ulcers suggested Beh√ßet's disease. Subsequently, pancytopenia developed and bone marrow examination revealed myelodysplastic syndrome. Cytogenetic examination revealed 7q- and 20q- but not 8+. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine and corticosteroid resulted in a dramatic improvement in both clinical signs and hematologic abnormalities.
