We encountered a case of Behçet's disease complicated with central diabetes insipidus. A hypothalamopituitary dysfunction is rare in Behçet's disease; only three cases of this association have been reported in the literature. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a dilatation of the left Sylvian vein and thickening of the pituitary stalk, which suggested intracranial vasculitic processes and lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis. The possible relationship of this disease combination is discussed as a form of autoimmune disease.
