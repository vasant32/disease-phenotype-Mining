Behçet disease is a heterogeneous, multisystem inflammatory disorder; vascular involvement has been considered to result from systemic vasculitis, which most frequently affects veins and occurs in 5% to 10% of these patients. However, superior vena cava (SVC) involvement is rare; it accounts for only 6% of the cases. The aim of this article is to a report on a case of SVC recanalization through the use of fibrinolysis and self-expanding stents as treatment of life-threatening SVC syndrome in a young male patient with Behçet disease.
