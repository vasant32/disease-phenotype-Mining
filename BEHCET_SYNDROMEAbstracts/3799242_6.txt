A family is described in which 3 of 12 members suffered from Behçet's syndrome. Four members, including the three patients with Behçet's syndrome suffered from recurrent aphthous stomatitis. These four family members possessed the HLA-haplotype HLA A2, B15, Cw3, DR4. However, one relative had inherited the same HLA-haplotype without showing any symptoms of the disease. Genetic influence from the actual HLA-haplotype may interact in manifestation of the syndrome.
