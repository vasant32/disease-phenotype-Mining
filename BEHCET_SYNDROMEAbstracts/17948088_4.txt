Behçet's syndrome is a chronic multisystem disease that presents with recurrent oral and genital ulceration and recurrent uveitis. Cardiac involvement is an extremely rare manifestation of this disorder. A 33-year-old man with Behçet's syndrome was admitted to our department with a history of cough, fever, chest pain, hemoptysis, and weight loss. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a right ventricular thrombus. After 1 month of treatment with warfarin, cyclophosphamide, and corticosteroid, the intracardiac thrombus resolved.
