The role of vascular surgery in Beh√ßet's disease is limited. It is concerned with the two types of lesion, venous and arterial, usually encountered. Indications for surgery in venous thrombosis did not differ from those in ordinary thrombo-embolic disease. The multicenter study reported divided arterial lesions into three groups: aneurysmal, occlusive or traumatic (arterial puncture) lesions. While surgery offers satisfactory results in the treatment of aneurysmal or traumatic lesions, the treatment of occlusive lesions is disappointing. Surgery is thus indicated only in patients with an aneurysm, bleeding or severe ischemia.
