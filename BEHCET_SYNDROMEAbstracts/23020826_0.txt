A patient with central nervous system involvement of Beh√ßet's disease was refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy and showed secondary failure of the anti-TNF agent infliximab. This presented as a progressive weakness of the legs and reduction in walking distance. The cerebrospinal fluid showed signs of inflammation including a vastly elevated IL-6 concentration. Given this result, the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab was administered and a good improvement of inflammatory parameters and a satisfactory increase of the walking distance were achieved.
