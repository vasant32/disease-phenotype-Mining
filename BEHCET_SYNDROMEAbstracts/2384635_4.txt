Light microscopic studies of 55 patients with complete and incomplete types of Behçet's syndrome were reviewed. We reported here 39 skin biopsies from 30 patients with cutaneous lesions of oral, and genital ulcers, folliculitis, erythema multiforme, and thrombophlebitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was seen in 5 of 12 (42%) cases of oral ulcers and 2 of 7 (29%) of genital ones. Lymphocytic vasculitis was demonstrated in 3 of 12 (25%) cases of oral ulcers and 4 of 7 (57%) of genital ulcers. However, the vasculitis was observed only locally in the areas with moderate or severe inflammation. From the biopsy specimens of our cases with fully developed mucocutaneous lesions of Behçet's syndrome, it appears that the forms of vasculitis that are often emphasized in the literature are a phenomenon secondary to the intense inflammation seen in such cutaneous lesions.
