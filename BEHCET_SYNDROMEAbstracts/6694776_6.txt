A 36-year-old man with Behçet's disease developed nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal failure. The renal biopsy confirmed renal amyloidosis, and the potassium permanganate staining indicated that the amyloid was of the AA protein type. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Behçet's disease with amyloidosis and chronic renal failure in maintenance hemodialysis.
