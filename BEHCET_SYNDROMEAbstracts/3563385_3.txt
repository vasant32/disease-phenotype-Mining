The authors, in a series of 65 cases of Beh√ßet's disease, notice 53% of rheumatological manifestations which are third in line after aphthosis and ocular disease. In order of decreasing frequency, it concerns arthritis (mono, oligo or poly-arthritis), arthralgias with an almost identical frequency, sacroiliitis, extraarticular involvement. These rheumatological manifestations are readily associated with necrotic pseudo-folliculitis and cutaneous aphthosis.
