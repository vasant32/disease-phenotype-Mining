Behçet's disease with posterior uveitis was studied in 12 cases by flash electroretinography (FERG) and pattern visually evoked cortical potential (PVECP). Disappearance of oscillatory potentials was the initial change noted in FERG. Subnormal FERG and a delay in peak latency of the P100 component of PVECP were observed in patients with poor visual acuity and long-standing Behçet's disease. Amplitudes of PVECP were significantly decreased in these patients. It was suggested that FERG together with PVECP were good indicators for monitoring posterior segment changes and visual prognosis in Behçet's disease.
