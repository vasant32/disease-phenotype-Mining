Therapy with systemic corticosteroids, despite attendant serious risks, is mandatory in diseases such as pemphigus, acute disseminated lupus erythematosus and some cases of exfoliative dermatitis that are ordinarily fatal, for in such cases life may be prolonged and the patients made comfortable. If no contraindications exist, therapy with corticosteroids is desirable, for diseases of short duration-contact dermatitis, serum sickness reactions and drug eruptions of all kinds-provided the causative factors have been removed and the reactions are causing severe distress.On the basis of encouraging reports in the literature corticosteroid therapy may be instituted with justification for a group of unrelated, intractable and discomforting diseases such as maddening pruritus ani, sclerema neonatorum, dermatomyositis, certain cases of sarcoidosis, berylliosis, Behcet's syndrome, universal calcinosis, Reiter's disease and ulcers of sickle-cell anemia. One must always bear in mind the well-defined contraindications to corticosteroid therapy and the hazards of its use, particularly if therapy is to be prolonged. Results from topical hydrocortisone therapy are particularly pleasing in chronic eczematous otitis externa and especially when it is combined with an antibiotic drug. Results are excellent also in nuchal eczema, dermatitis of the eyelids and in pruritus ani. More often than not, hydrocortisone ointment and lotions benefit more than do other standard remedies such diseases as atopic eczema, contact dermatitis, lichen simplex-chronicus and eczematized phases of conditions such as psoriasis and superficial mycotic infections. Preparations containing a combination of hydrocortisone and an antibiotic are more useful than hydrocortisone alone. When used with discrimination, with full attention to the selection of cases and proper concentration in the correct vehicle, hydrocortisone preparations in combination with antibiotics are excellent antieczematous agents.
