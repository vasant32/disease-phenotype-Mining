Beh√ßet's disease, a multisystem disease is, by its nature, difficult to diagnose. The first manifestation of the disease may precede the appearance of other symptoms and signs essential for diagnosis by many years. In patients of Mediterranean origin, the early manifestations of the disease, may be confused with those of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Determination of HLA-B5 may, however, contribute to the diagnosis in children with partial manifestations of Beh,cet syndrome.
