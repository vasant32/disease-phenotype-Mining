Cardiovascular manifestations have been reported in 7-38% of patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD), and mortality occurs in up to 20% of those with marked vascular involvement. Sporadic cases of endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm, ventricular thrombosis, congestive cardiomyopathy, and valvular dysfunction have been reported. Here we report a case of acute myocardial infarction that resulted from the compression of coronary arteries by a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm in a patient with BD.
