Beh√ßet's disease is a chronic relapsing inflammatory process affecting mucocutaneous, ocular, intestinal, articular, vascular, urogenital, and neurologic systems. Vascular lesions include superficial thrombophlebitis, large vein thrombosis and arterial aneurysm. The underlying pathologic feature was thought to be vasculitis. We report a case of a 37-year-old male patient suffering from frequent attacks of leg swelling and tenderness. Progressive engorgement of abdominal superficial veins was observed. Venography demonstrated evidence of deep vein thrombosis in both limbs. MRI of the abdomen showed thrombosis of the inferior vena cava with collateral circulation. The above symptoms improved after treatment.
