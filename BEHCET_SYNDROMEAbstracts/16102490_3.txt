 PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the clinical course, complications, and visual outcome of pediatric uveitis. METHODS: Our sample included 38 consecutive children with uveitis treated between 1986 and 2002: 15 with idiopathic uveitis, 10 with Behcet disease, 9 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, 4 with other diagnoses. The last group was excluded from the analysis because of its small size. Appropriate ophthalmologic and laboratory examinations were obtained. Treatment consisted of topical, periocular, or systemic steroids with or without immunosuppression. RESULTS: Complications occurred in all 3 groups, although they tended to be more severe in the patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Visual acuity improved from presentation to final examination; the difference was statistically significant for the patients with idiopathic uveitis (P < 0.0005) and Behcet disease (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an intensive treatment approach to childhood uveitis. The visual prognosis is good even in patients with a severe clinical course.
