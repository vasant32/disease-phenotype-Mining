INTRODUCTION: The macular damage in Behçet's disease requires particular attention because of its poor prognosis. PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to specify the frequency of macular alterations in Behçet's disease and discuss the clinical, physiopathological and therapeutic aspects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our report is based on 244 patients with Behçet's disease examined between January 1995 and December 1997. The authors studied macular alterations in detail. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients had a maculopathy affecting 108 out of 432 eyes (24%). The mean progression of Behçet's disease in these cases was 4 years. Visual acuity was<or=2/10e in 48 eyes (44.4%). Maculopathy was bilateral in 39 cases. Macular edema was the most frequently noted form in 62% of the eyes, followed by cystoid macular edema (17%) and macular hole (3.4%). DISCUSSION: Macular edema is the most frequent sign and complication arising from the macular area during Behçet's disease, which can evolve into cystoid degenerescence and occasionally macular hole. Macular lesions are often irreversible, making prognosis uncertain, despite the various treatments available. CONCLUSION: Macular damage is the major cause of visual morbidity in patients with Behçet's disease and should be systematically sought.
