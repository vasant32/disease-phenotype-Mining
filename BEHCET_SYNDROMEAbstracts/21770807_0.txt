 PURPOSE: To report a case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) endotheliitis after insertion of an intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide (Retisert) implant. Design: Interventional case report. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: A 40-year-old man received a Retisert implant in the left eye for recurrent Behçet uveitis. Although inflammation became quiescent within a month, corneal edema developed 4 months after insertion. Polymerase chain reaction analysis for aqueous humor detected 3.9 × 10(4) copies/mL of CMV DNA. After treatment with oral valganciclovir, CMV DNA nearly disappeared but visual outcome was poor due to corneal decompensation resulting from severe endothelial cell loss. CONCLUSIONS: After Retisert implant, clinicians should be attentive to the potential risk of CMV endotheliitis.
