A retrospective clinical trial was performed to review the management and discuss the outcome of cataract extraction in eyes with complicated cataract due to ocular Beh√ßet's disease (BD) (n = 55) and idiopathic uveitis (IU) (n = 43). The aim was to find the best method of treatment in each pathology. The surgical methods were intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), ECCE + intraocular lens (ECCE + IOL), and ECCE + trabeculectomy (ECCE + T). The postoperative visual prognosis was found to be significantly worse in eyes with ocular BD, than in those with IU because of the severe posterior segment complications of ocular BD, particularly optic atrophy (p < 0.05). When the outcome was evaluated with regard to the individual surgical techniques, the prognosis was found to be significantly better in eyes with IU undergoing ECCE than in those with BD undergoing the same operation (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the groups with regard to the other surgical treatment modalities (p < 0.05).
