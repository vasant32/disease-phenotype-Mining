We used a new combined chemo- (COP/ABVD), radiation and interferon-alpha (10 x 10(6) IU s.c. 3x per week/12 months) therapy regimen to treat severe multicentric Castleman's disease (CD) complicated by relapsing Behcet's disease (BD) manifestations. More than 16 years after diagnosis of CD the patient remains in very good clinical condition, with remission of all CD and BD manifestations 13 months after discontinuation of the interferon-alpha treatment. In addition, our clinicopathological, immunohistological and virological data suggest a pathogenetic link between CD and BD via activation of pre-existing BD-specific plasma cells due to CD-related HHV8-induced overexpression of interleukin-6.
