Behçet syndrome is a systemic disease rather than the initial more narrowly characterized triple symptom-complex of recurrent oral and genital ulcers and chronic iridocyclitis. Major cardiac and pulmonary manifestations of the disease are relatively uncommon and their pathologic features have seldom been documented. Described herein is a fatal case of Behçet syndrome with co-existing myocarditis, pulmonary thromboangiitis, and pulmonary artery aneurysms.
