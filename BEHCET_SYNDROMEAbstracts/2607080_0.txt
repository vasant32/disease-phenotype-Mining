Behçet's disease is a chronic systemic disorder characterized by recurrent uveitis, aphthous lesions of the mouth, and ulcerations of the genitalia. Vision loss from ocular involvement is frequently the presenting symptom and optometrists should be aware of the various ocular signs of Behçet's disease. Management of the Behçet's patient involves systemic therapy and therefore requires comanagement with an internist and/or ophthalmologist. A case report of this infrequent type of uveitis is described along with a discussion of the care and visual prognosis of the Behçet's patient.
