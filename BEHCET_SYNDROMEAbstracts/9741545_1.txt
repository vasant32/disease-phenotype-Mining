To investigate prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in patients with Behcet's disease (BD) and to determine whether they are related to anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (aGPI), we measured aCL and aGPI in 47 patients of BD and 14 patients of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The levels of aCL and aGPI were determined by conventional enzyme immunoassay for both IgG and IgM classes. Twelve (25.5%) patients with BD were positive for IgG or IgM aCL and no patient was positive for aGPI. Eleven (78.6%) patients with SLE were also positive for aCL and among them, 8 (72.7%) patients were positive for aGPI. Positive IgG aCL patients with BD showed lower level of IgG aCL than those with SLE (15.7+/-7.3 vs 34.1+/-16.0 GPL, p<0.05). There was no relation between the presence of aCL in BD and either dinical activity or clinical features. In the patients with BD, aCL are found but it would not be associated with aGPI as they are in patients with SLE. In patients with BD, aCL seem to be authentic aCL unlike those in patients with SLE and may not be related with vascular complications in BD.
