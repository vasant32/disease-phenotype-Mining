 PURPOSE: To report endovascular repair of dual aneurysms in a patient with Behçet's disease. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old man diagnosed 6 months prior with Behçet's disease presented with a pulsating abdominal mass. Computed tomography revealed a 70-mm-diameter pseudoaneurysm in the abdominal aorta and another (20 mm) in the celiac trunk 5 mm from the aorta. Staged endovascular repair began with the aortic aneurysm, which was excluded with a bifurcated 23 x 140-mm Excluder stent-graft. Three days later, 2 Jostent stent-grafts were placed in the celiac trunk, successfully excluding the lesion. Fifteen days later, the patient was discharged on a regimen of clopidogrel, cyclosporine, and warfarin. At 6 months, the CT scan showed good perfusion of the stent-grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal involvement of the celiac trunk in a patient with Behçet's disease is a rare pathology that appears amenable to stent-graft repair.
