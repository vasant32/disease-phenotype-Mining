Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is a common manifestation and leading cause of mortality related to Behcet disease. Endovascular treatment is usually required when medical therapy alone fails to control progression. Successful superselective embolization of a giant PAA with the "bubble technique" was performed with use of a high concentration (75%) of n-butyl-cyanoacrylate in a patient with Behcet disease who had recurrent hemoptysis.
