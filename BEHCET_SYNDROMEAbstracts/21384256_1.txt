Behçet's disease (BD) is an idiopathic multisystem disorder. Involvement of CNS occurs in 4-48% of cases. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of subclinical neuropsychiatric affection in asymptomatic Egyptian BD patients using psychometric tests and brain imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), also to assess possibly associated clinical predictive variables. Twenty-five BD patients without overt CNS involvement and ten healthy controls matched for age, education, and sex completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including Hamilton scales for anxiety and depression and Wechsler memory scale-revised. Disease activity was assessed using Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF). SPECT was done for all subjects, and 12 patients underwent brain MRI. Compared to controls, 23 (92%) and 24 (96%) patients had anxiety and depression scores respectively above normal range; also, BD patients had significantly lower memory quotient (MQ). SPECT revealed abnormalities in 16/25 (64%), while in 3/12 patients (25%), MRI was abnormal. Subjects with abnormal SPECT had significantly higher ages than those with normal SPECT (P = 0.02) and were more frequently males (P = 0.03). No statistically significant differences between cases with normal or abnormal SPECT were found regarding disease duration, frequency of headache, BDCAF, frequency of active eye disease, major vascular involvement, mean Hamilton anxiety and depression scores, and mean MQ. Early diagnosis of neurological involvement in BD is important in reducing or preventing complications. Neuropsychiatric evaluation and HMPAO brain SPECT were found to be useful for detecting subclinical neurological abnormalities in BD patients.
