Behçet's disease is a rare clinical event characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, and iridocyclitis. Vascular involvement is a rare but serious form of the disease. We present a case of renal interlobar artery pseudoaneurysm occurring in a 20-year-old male patient with a 5-year history of Behçet's disease, who had been admitted because of right flank pain. Findings obtained on abdominal ultrasonography, abdominal computed tomography, and renal angiography confirmed a right renal pseudoaneurysm and subcapsular hematoma.
