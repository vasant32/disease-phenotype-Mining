OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: To present the clinical case of a patient suffering from a rhabdomyoma associated to Behçet's disease. PATIENTS: A 35-year-old man with a history of high fever associated to oral ulcers, sinus tachycardia, leukocytosis and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Physical examination, chest x-ray, blood chemistry, serology and rheumatic tests were normal. Seriate sputum cultures, urocultures and blood cultures were negative. The echocardiogram showed a non-obstructive mass in the right ventricle, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. INTERVENTIONS: Resection of the tumor under cardiopulmonary bypass. After the post-operative recurrence of the fever and the appearance of genital ulcers, the diagnosis of Behçet's disease was made. Two and a half years after the operation the patient remains asymptomatic under treatment with colchicine. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical setting suggested a malignant tumor of the right ventricle but the pathological findings showed an adult rhabdomyoma. The rarity of finding a rhabdomyoma in an adult is stressed, as well as its association with Behçet's disease.
