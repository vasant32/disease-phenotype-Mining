BACKGROUND: Although four of five of the new international criteria for the diagnosis of Behçet's disease relate to mucocutaneous lesions, disagreement exists as to the exact nature of cutaneous lesions (e.g., vessel-based vs follicular). OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to review clinical data, clinical photographs, and skin biopsy specimens from multiple medical centers throughout the world to monitor current practice in the implementation of mucocutaneous diagnostic criteria for Behçet's disease. METHODS: Ten medical centers responded to a request to collaborate by sending clinical data, photographs of cutaneous lesions, and biopsy specimens from 22 patients. RESULTS: Of specimens from 22 patients, 14 revealed a histopathologic pattern of neutrophils containing perivascular and interstitial inflammation, whereas specimens from three patients revealed only mononuclear cells in a vessel-based pattern. Biopsy specimens from three patients revealed primarily folliculocentric inflammation and an additional two specimens were from erythema nodosum-like lesions. CONCLUSION: Perivascular inflammation was the predominant histopathologic finding in specimens of cutaneous lesions in this clinical series. Folliculocentric lesions could not be predicted on the basis of review of clinical photographs. Histopathologic assessment of cutaneous lesions is crucial if the proposal is accepted that exclusion of folliculocentric lesions is important to ensure accurate implementation of diagnostic criteria in patients with suspected Behçet's disease.
