Whether patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and immunosuppressive therapy are generally prone to acquire severe infectious diseases is unknown. A 48-year-old man under corticosteroids and azathioprine for BD since 1995 was admitted because of a transitory ischemic attack. Between the third and fourth hospital day he was accidentally locked up, insufficiently dressed, in the hospital's chapel over night. On the following day, he developed fever and deteriorating consciousness until he became comatose. CT scans of the brain were normal and there was only a slight pleocytosis. Despite adequate therapy, the patient's condition further deteriorated such that he died. Responsible for his decline was a fulminate sepsis, diagnosed upon fever, increased C-reactive protein, thrombocyte decline, multi-organ failure, rhabdomyolysis, growth of S. aureus on blood culture, and autopsy. Patients with BD and immunosuppressive therapy, may be more vulnerable to infections and may develop lethal overwhelming sepsis already after overnight cold exposure.
