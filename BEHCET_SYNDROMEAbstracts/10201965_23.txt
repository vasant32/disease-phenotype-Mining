To determine whether antilymphocyte Abs to T cell costimulatory molecules are generated in patients with autoimmune diseases and, if they exist, to clarify the mechanism of their production and pathological roles, we investigated the presence of autoantibodies to CTLA-4 (CD152), CD28, B7-1 (CD80), and B7-2 (CD86) in serum samples obtained from patients with various autoimmune diseases and from normal subjects using recombinant fusion proteins. In ELISAs, anti-CD28, anti-B7-1, and anti-B7-2 Abs were rarely seen, whereas anti-CTLA-4 Abs were detected in 8.2% of the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 18.8% of those with rheumatoid arthritis, 3.1% of those with systemic sclerosis, 31.8% of those with Behçet's disease, 13.3% of those with Sjögren's syndrome, and 0% of healthy donors. This reactivity was confirmed by immunoblotting. More importantly, the purified anti-CTLA-4 Abs reacted with CTLA-4 expressed on P815 cells by flow cytometry. In addition, we found at least three epitopes on the CTLA-4 molecule. Furthermore, among the patients with Behçet's disease, uveitis was seen significantly less frequently in the anti-CTLA-4 Ab-positive patients. Taken collectively, these data indicate that anti-CTLA-4 autoantibodies are generated in systemic autoimmune diseases by an Ag-driven mechanism and may modulate the immune response in vivo by binding to CTLA-4 on T cells.
