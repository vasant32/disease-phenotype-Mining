Vasculitis with central diabetes insipidus is a rare condition which must be recognized for an appropriate management. We report a case of Behçet disease with central diabetes insipidus. A forty seven year old men presented recurring oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, polyarthralgia. Two years later, he showed right uveitis and central diabetes insipidus without dysfunction of the pituitary gland. Computed tomographic scan showed normal neurohypophysis and pituitary gland. Later on, he presented hemiplegia. The cerebral computed tomographic scan showed hypodense lesions. Central diabetes insipidus should not be systematically searched because it is a rare feature of the Behçet disease.
