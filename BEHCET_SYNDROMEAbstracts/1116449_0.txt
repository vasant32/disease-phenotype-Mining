A case is reported of Beh√ßet's disease in a 41-year-old man, in the course of which colitis with perforation developed over two years, with fatal results. This is a rare complication of Behcet's disease and must be differentiated from ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Blood transfusions have a limited therapeutic value in the terminal phase of the disease, which among others is characterized by a generalized depression of response of peripheral lymphocytes to stimulation.
