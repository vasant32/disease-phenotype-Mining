Intestinal Behcet's disease in a 19-year-old girl was diagnosed because of the history of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and typical endoscopic findings of esophageal and ileal ulcers. Her symptoms (e.g., dysphagia and retrosternal pain) were gradually relieved by treatment with prednisolone and total parenteral nutrition. However, about one month later, oral and esophageal ulcers appeared again. Mesalazine was added. Oral and esophageal ulcers healed promptly, and have not relapsed for about one year. Although mesalazine appears to act locally in the small intestine and colon, the therapeutic effect of mesalazine in this case may be explained by the systemic antiinflammatory effect. This case suggests that mesalazine is an effective drug and is a good candidate in the treatment of intestinal Behcet's disease, especially accompanied with esophageal involvement.
