We report a 69-year-old man admitted in intensive care unit for aseptic meningoencephalitis. Initially, suspicion of an infectious etiology led to introduce an anti-infectious treatment. Behçet's disease was diagnosed during hospitalization incited to screen for noninfectious etiologies. A high dose steroid therapy was rapidly effective. The diagnosis of neuro-Behçet's disease was entertained.
