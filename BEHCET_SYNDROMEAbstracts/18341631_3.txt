This study aimed to assess the fibrinolytic inhibitors and their association with thrombosis in Behçet disease. Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) (P < 0.001) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels (P = 0.022) were significantly higher in 79 patients than in 84 controls. No significant differences were observed in CPB2 (TAFI) Thr325Ile and SERPINE1 (PAI1) 4G/5G polymorphism distribution between patients and controls. TAFI activity levels were significantly higher in patients with thrombosis than in those without thrombosis (P = 0.024). In conclusion, the increased TAFI levels in Behçet disease could contribute to the increased risk of thrombosis observed in these patients.
