Behcet's disease (also called Admantiades-Behcet syndrome) is a chronic vasculitis. The disease is characterized by exacerbations and remissions of symptoms and organ manifestations and may produce only mild mucocutaneous lesions, whereas ocular lesions can cause blindness. In addition, involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system (CNS) and large blood vessels is sometimes life-threatening. Cyclosporin A is the only agent for treatment of ocular lesions registered in Germany; however, the neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity restrict usage of the drug. In patients suffering from severe uveitis, biologics have been a breakthrough. Interferon (IFN) alpha therapy has shown significant efficacy for intraocular inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies to TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 have been successful in clinical trials and are approved in some countries. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge and emphasizes the important role of the ophthalmologist in the therapy of Behcet's disease.
