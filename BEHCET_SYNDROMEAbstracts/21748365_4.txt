A 47-year-old female patient with Behçet's disease had been treated with colchicine, prednisolone, cyclosporine A, and infliximab. Because she relapsed, however, treatment with tocilizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin 6 receptor antibody, was started. This treatment suppressed the patient's clinical manifestations, including ocular attacks, for 1 year and improved her visual acuity. This experience indicates that tocilizumab may constitute a therapeutic option for refractory Behçet's disease.
