The distribution of trace elements Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, and Rb was determined in sera from patients with the complete type of Beh√ßet disease in the active stage and from healthy controls. Total reflection x-ray fluorescence was used for quantitative analysis; in general, atomic absorption spectrometry was used only for control of the Se values. Zn, Se, and Rb concentrations were significantly (P < 0.0001) lower for patients than for control subjects. No significant difference was determined in the Fe content. However, there was a significant increase in Cu in the patients so that the ratios Cu/Zn, Cu/Se, and Cu/Rb were significantly higher for the patients than for the control subjects (P < 0.0001).
