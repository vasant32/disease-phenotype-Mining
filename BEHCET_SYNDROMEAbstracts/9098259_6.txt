PURPOSE: Even though conjunctiva is not primarily involved in patients with uveitis due to Behçet disease, it may reflect the immunopathologic process when inflammation is induced by biopsy of conjunctiva, a phenomenon similar to the induced inflammation at skin pathergy sites. METHODS: Conjunctival biopsy specimens obtained 48 hours after a 2-mm biopsy of the epibulbar conjunctiva in 26 Turkish patients with inactive ocular Behçet disease and 9 Turkish patients with inactive idiopathic uveitis were studied by immunoperoxidase using a panel of monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD1, -CD3, -CD4, -CD5, -CD14, -CD22, -CD25, and -CD67, HLA-DR, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). RESULTS: Immunopathology of the conjunctival specimens obtained at the time of first biopsy was not significantly different between the Behçet disease and the idiopathic uveitis groups. The second-biopsy specimens of the patients with Behçet disease showed significantly greater numbers of T cells (CD3+, CD4+) and granulocytes (CD67+) as well as HLA-DR+ and ICAM-1+ cells in the substantia propria. Vascular endothelium of the conjunctiva in a patient with Behçet disease had significantly more pronounced expression of the adhesion molecules, E-selectin, and ICAM-1. None of the conjunctival specimens in either group showed VCAM-1 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a more intense antigen-independent inflammation develops with recruitment of both neutrophils and T lymphocytes of helper/ inducer phenotype in the conjunctiva of patients with Behçet disease in response to surgical trauma. Increased expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 in the conjunctiva of patients with Behçet disease may suggest a critical role for these adhesion molecules in the initial events of inflammation.
