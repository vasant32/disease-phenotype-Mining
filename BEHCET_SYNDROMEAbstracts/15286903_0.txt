OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of granulocyte apheresis (GCAP) in patients with Ocular Behçet's Disease (BD) resistant to immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone, cyclosporin, azathyoprine or mycophenolate mofetil). METHODS: Prospective observational study of five cases, carried out in a university centre. Four patients were resistant to medical treatment and one refused immunosuppressive drugs. The intervention procedure consisted of an extracorporeal GCAP using a column filled with cellulose acetate beads (Adacolumn, JIMRO, Takasaki, Japan). All patients received underwent a schedule of therapy of five sessions, once a week for five consecutive weeks. Visual acuity (Snellen lines), the degree of intraocular inflammation and doses of immunosuppressive therapy were measured and observed every week. RESULTS: Visual acuity improved in the five cases. Intraocular inflammation was measured and observed in every case, relapses were avoided, and treatment with prednisone was reduced by more than half of the initial dose (average reduction 52.7%, SD 14). CONCLUSIONS: GCAP has been shown to be safe and effective as a new therapy in five cases of Ocular Behçet's Disease refractory to medical treatment. Further research is needed in order to confirm the promising results of these initial investigations.
