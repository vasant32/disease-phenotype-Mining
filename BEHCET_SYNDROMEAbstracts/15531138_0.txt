We describe a case of neuro-Behcet's disease (NBD) characterized by recurrent attacks of neurologic deficit. T2-weighted images showed a high signal intensity lesion with extensive edema in the right thalamolenticular region, midbrain, and pons as well as the cerebral white matter. After a relapse of the disease, MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity in the left thalamus, internal capsule, and midbrain. These MRI abnormalities showed marked resolution with steroid treatment. We observed sequential MRI findings in a patient with a relapsing-remitting form of NBD who had parenchymal CNS involvement, and we examined the correlation among the MRI findings and clinical features during the clinical course.
