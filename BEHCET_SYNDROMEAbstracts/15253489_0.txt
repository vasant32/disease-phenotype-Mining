The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 245 patients with posterior uveitis or panuveitis in order to determine their etiologies and collect some epidemiological data. A specific diagnosis was made in 80.4%. Behcet's disease (22.4%), toxoplasmosis (22%), and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (9%) were the most common causes of posterior uveitis or panuveitis. No case of confirmed sarco√Ødosis was found in our series.
