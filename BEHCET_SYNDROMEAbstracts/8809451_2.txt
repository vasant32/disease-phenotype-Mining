Behçet's disease is a chronic, relapsing, multisystem disease characterized by the clinical triad of genital ulcers, oral ulcers and ocular involvement. Twelve Saudi children are presented, all of whom satisfied the international criteria for the classification of Behçet's disease and whose initial manifestations appeared at or before the age of 16 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. The mean age at onset was 11.5 years (range 7-16 years) and the mean duration of disease was 6.5 years (range 3-13 years). Oral ulcers were present in all patients (100%), genital ulcers in 11 patients (91%), ocular involvement in the form of anterior and/or posterior uveitis in 6 patients (50%), skin manifestations in 10 patients (83%), musculoskeletal symptoms in 9 patients (75%), and central nervous system involvement in 6 patients (50%). One patient had thrombophlebitis and another had pulmonary artery aneurysm. No renal, cardiovascular or gastrointestinal abnormalities were detected. The pathergy test was positive in 3/7 patients. HLA B5 (W51) typing was positive in 5/10 patients. This report of juvenile Behçet's disease in Saudi children suggests that this multisystem disease has an aggressive nature and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood vasculitis in endemic areas.
