Soluble forms of selectins may play a regulatory role in inflammatory responses. The aim of this study was to examine the levels of serum-soluble (s) selectins in Beh√ßet's disease (BD) patients and to evaluate the associations of these molecules to disease activity, clinical findings, and drugs taken for BD, mainly colchicine. Serum sE-, sL-, and sP-selectins levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 28 BD patients and 22 healthy subjects. The BD patients were classified according to the disease activity, clinical findings, and therapy. Ten patients were newly diagnosed and were not taking any therapy. Remainder were on colchicine (n = 18) and immunosuppressive drugs (n = 5). In BD patients, the levels of sL- and sP-selectins were significantly lower than those of healthy controls, but sE-selectin level was similar to that of the controls. The patients on the therapy had significantly lower levels of sE- and sL-selectins and insignificantly lower level of sP-selectin than the patients not receiving therapy. The BD patients with active disease had significantly higher levels of sE-, sL-, and sP-selectins compared with the patients with inactive disease. There were no significant differences in the levels of selectins between the treated active patients and inactive patients. However, the untreated patients with active disease had significantly higher selectin levels than the inactive patients. There were no significant differences in all selectin levels between the patients with or without vascular involvement. Serum sL-selectin was found to be significantly higher in patients with erythema nodosum. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the levels of soluble selectin molecules in BD patients seem to be modified by the drugs taken for BD. The colchicine therapy is associated with lower selectin levels.
