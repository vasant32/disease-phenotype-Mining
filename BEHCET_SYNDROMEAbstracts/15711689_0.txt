Vascular involvement in Behcet's disease is rare approximately 14% venous and 1.6% arterial, serious and recurrent. We report a case of Behcet's disease with deep venous thrombosis and right iliac pseudoaneurysm which was repaired with polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE graft. The patient received warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, immunosuppressive and corticosteroids. Two months later the patient developed manifestations of superior vena cava thrombosis and the graft was blocked. Three months later, ischemia of the right foot deteriorated and left femoral artery to right femoral artery crossover PTFE graft was performed.
