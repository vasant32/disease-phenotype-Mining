Behçet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder that is classified among the vasculitides and can affect all types and sizes of blood vessels.  Vascular manifestations of Behçet's disease are venous and arterial occlusion, and arterial aneurysms. As vasculitis of the vasa vasorum is the main pathological hallmark of Behçet's disease, it is generally seen as superficial thrombo-phlebitis or  occlusion of the major veins; however arterial obstruction and aneurysms may also be seen to a lesser extent. Iliac artery stenosis is highly uncommon. Here, a case of common iliac stenosis in a 48-year-old patient with Behçet's disease is reported. As the risk of aneurysm during an operation was high  in this patient, he was treated with vascular stent implantation. Due to stent occlusion two months after the operation, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed with  an 8-mm balloon. During the three-year follow up, no obstruction was observed.
