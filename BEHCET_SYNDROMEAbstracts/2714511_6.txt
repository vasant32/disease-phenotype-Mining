A case is described in which a patient with ulcerative colitis developed chronic vaginal ulceration around the incision lines after cone biopsy. The ulcers persisted at the vaginal vault after abdominal hysterectomy and removal of a cuff of vagina. Non-specific histological features compatible with pyoderma gangrenosum were found on biopsy. The auto-immune nature of this chronic ulcer is further supported by its rapid response to steroid therapy and the subsequent development of Beh√ßet's syndrome.
