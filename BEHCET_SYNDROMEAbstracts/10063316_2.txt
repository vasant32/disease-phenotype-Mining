OBJECTIVES: To analyze arthritic manifestations in Behcet disease, which is one of the most common manifestations of Behcet disease. METHODS: Among the patients who visited the Rheumatology Division, Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center, Taegu, Korea from March 1997 to February 1998, 35 patients, with more than 3 months follow-up, were compatible for the diagnosis of Behcet disease according to the Shimizu criteria, after exclusion of uncertain or possible Behcet cases. The presence of various manifestations was evaluated. Regarding the joint manifestations, the involved joint, signs and the pattern of the articular symptoms were examined. Basic laboratory tests, HLA studies and simple radiologic studies were done. RESULTS: All 35 patients had evident, recurrent, painful oral ulcers by the study definition. Genital ulcers were found in 29%, skin lesions in 77%, uveitis in 9%, gastrointestinal ulcerations in 6% and vascular manifestations in 6%. Joint manifestations appeared in 97%. Knee(91%), proximal interphalangeal (53%) and metacarpophalangeal joints(21%) were the main sites. Tenderness was prominent in 91% and swelling in 44%. Polyarticular presentation was found in 47%. In most cases (76.4%), the articular symptom was short-lasting. C-reactive protein was likely to be positive in active Behcet disease. HLA B51 was positive in 46%. CONCLUSIONS: In Behcet disease, various manifestations can be found. The arthritic manifestation seems quite common. It may present as seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. Otherwise, it may present as palindromic rheumatism.
