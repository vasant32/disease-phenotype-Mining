Twenty-three patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) meeting the criteria of the international group for classification and diagnosis of BD (17 men and 6 women) were typed for HLA antigens class 1. The patients group was multinational, of them 19 were Caucasoids and 4 Mongoloids. It was shown that HLA B5 in Caucasoids occurred more frequently vs normal controls (73.7% and 15.5%, respectively). Under the correction of the antigens number up to 21, the differences continued to be statistically high. Characteristic for B5 antigen was a high relative risk and close association with the disease. In antigen group B5 + B35 the relative risk and association power grew still higher. The B5 positive group statistically more frequently had superficial thrombophlebitis and less frequently gastrointestinal involvement. It is concluded that class 1 HLA antigens, B5 in particular, are closely associated with BD in CIS countries.
