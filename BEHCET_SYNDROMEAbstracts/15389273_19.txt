PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of infliximab as treatment for noninfectious posterior uveitis. METHODS: An open-label clinical trial including seven patients (12 eyes) with posterior uveitis refractory to conventional treatment regimens with corticosteroids and at least one immunosuppressive agent. Three intravenous doses of 5 mg/kg of infliximab were administered at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Infliximab infusion was repeated in patients undergoing a relapse of uveitis after initial remission. Improvement was defined as amelioration of visual acuity or disappearance of retinal exudates and/or haemorrhages, decreased macular oedema and/or vitreous opacities. All patients were followed up for at least 36 months. RESULTS: Six of the seven patients (five diagnosed with Beh√ßet's disease and one diagnosed with sarcoidosis) showed a significant improvement after the first infliximab dose. Only in one patient diagnosed with chronic idiopathic multifocal choroiditis did the drug have no effect, and this patient was withdrawn from the study. At the end of follow-up, one eye had lost one line of vision and three eyes showed improved vision. All eyes had improved in terms of signs of inflammation. No adverse effects of treatment were observed. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is efficient and safe for the long-term management of refractory posterior uveitis, especially in patients with predominant retinal vasculitis and vitritis.
