OBJECTIVES: Corticosteroids are widely used in Behçet's syndrome despite the absence of controlled studies. We assessed the effect of depot corticosteroids primarily for genital ulcers and secondarily for the other mucocutaneous manifestations of Behçet's syndrome. METHODS: We randomized 86 patients who had active disease with genital ulcers to receive either intramuscular corticosteroid injections (40 mg methylprednisolone acetate) or placebo every 3 weeks for 27 weeks. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (88%) completed the treatment. There were no significant differences in the mean number of genital and oral ulcers, or folliculitis between groups. The mean number of erythema nodosum lesions was less in the corticosteroid group as a whole (P = 0.0046); subgroup analyses revealed that this was significant for females (P = 0.0148) but not for males (P = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Low-dose depot corticosteroids did not have any beneficial effect on genital ulcers. However, it was useful in controlling erythema nodosum lesions, especially among the females.
