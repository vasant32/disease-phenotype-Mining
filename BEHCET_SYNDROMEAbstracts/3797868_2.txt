The authors report the case of a 33-year old male Tunisian who, 7 years after the onset of complete Beh√ßet's disease (diagnosed on international criteria) developed a nephrotic syndrome diagnosed as renal amyloidosis on histological evidence. Attenuation of Congo red staining by potassium permanganate pointed to AA type amyloidosis. Despite treatment with colchicine and cyclophosphamide the patient's condition deteriorated. Amyloid deposits were found in a small bowel biopsy performed for persistent diarrhoea. The patient died 3 years after amyloidosis was diagnosed. The authors have reviewed the literature concerning this exceptional association: in all cases where it was typed the amyloidosis was AA. Attention is drawn to the failure of colchicine in this patient.
