Experiments both in vitro and in vivo have been performed to study the chemotactic response of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) in Behçet's syndrome. The experimental results were apparently contradictory. Using modified Boyden chambers we found that the PMNs from patients with Behçet's syndrome responded to a greater extent in vitro than normal cells, but with skin chambers placed over abrasions the in vivo response was less than normal. The significance of these findings is discussed and related to the histological appearances that may be seen in this condition.
