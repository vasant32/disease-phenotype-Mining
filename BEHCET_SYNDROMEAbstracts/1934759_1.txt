We experienced one necropsy case of brainstem encephalitis of Iizuka type (BSE) and one necropsy case of the brain-stem syndrome (BSS) of typical neuro-Behçet's disease, and compared them clinically and neuropathologically. Clinically both of these cases showed chronic progressive mental disturbance, pseudobulbar paresis, spastic tetraparesis, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, increased protein, and brainstem atrophy observed by X-CT. Neuropathologically, irregular, boundary-indistinct demyelinating lesions and obsolete softening lesions were sporadically found, associated with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration and gliosis centering on the brainstem. In this way, both cases were similar in many points except for the presence or absence of cutaneo-muco-ocular signs specific for Behçet's disease. Also BSE and BSS reports in the literature showed that both diseases were similar not only in clinical findings consisting of mental disturbance and brainstem signs but also in neuropathological findings with similar topographical distribution of the same histopathological changes, including the variations and diversity of these characteristics. Especially of much interest is their similarity in characteristic mental disturbance. In discriminating BSE from multiple sclerosis and other diseases with exclusive involvement of the brainstem, it is important to understand their clinical characteristics. The characteristic mental disturbance includes damage to memory and sentiment, a change in personality, and lowering in spontaneity, but calculation ability and orientation are comparatively preserved. Of course the similarity in clinical and neuropathological findings does not necessarily mean the identical etiopathogenesis. However, it is possible to consider that neuro-Behçet's disease (syndrome) may form a wide spectrum with BSE and typical neuro-Behçet's disease at the both ends, regarding the time and spatial diversity of the appearance of cutaneo-muco-ocular signs.
