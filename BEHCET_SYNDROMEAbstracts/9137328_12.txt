We analyzed the incidence, clinical features, and the long-term sequelae of arthropathy in 84 patients with Behçet's disease. After a mean disease duration of 44.7 months, 59 patients (70%) had at least 1 episode of arthropathy. Of these, arthropathy was present at the time of diagnosis in the majority of patients (75%). In the remainder, arthropathy developed 4 to 80 months (mean 29) after the diagnosis of Behçet's disease. Female patients were significantly more likely to have arthropathy than male patients (89 versus 56%, p = 0.006). The pattern of involvement was oligoarticular in 75%, monoarticular in 23%, and polyarticular in 2% of these patients. The most commonly involved site was the knee, followed by the ankle and the wrist. Radiologic examination of the involved site was normal in 80% of the patients. After a mean duration of arthropathy of 43.2 months, by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, the functional class of the arthropathy was I-II in 88%, and III-IV in 12%. In conclusion arthropathy is a fairly common manifestation in patients with Behçet's disease, but crippling arthritis is relatively rare.
