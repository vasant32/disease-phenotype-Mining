Behçet's disease is a multisystem relapsing inflammatory disorder of unknown     cause. Neurological involvement is one of the most serious causes of long-term     morbidity and mortality in Behçet's disease. Cerebral abscess is very rare in     literature. A 45-yr-old man with Behçet's disease manifesting focal epileptic     seizure and multiple cerebral abscesses is reported in the case. He was     diagnosed with cerebral abscess and was treated with antibiotics but no     improvement occurred. Excisional biopsy was performed and the lesions were     consistent with abscess. The clinical state of the patient gradually improved.     The patient had no further complications. The etiology, and clinical and     magnetic resonance imaging findings are discussed.
