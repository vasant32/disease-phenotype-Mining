Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is difficult to diagnose in children because patients often do not have characteristic symptoms and pediatricians have a low awareness of BD. We report on the case of BD in a 12-year-old boy that presented as endocarditis. Prednisolone, started after infective endocarditis had been ruled out, had a dramatic effect. Cardiac involvement in BD and the differential diagnosis of endocarditis are discussed.
