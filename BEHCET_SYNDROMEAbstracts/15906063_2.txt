 PURPOSE: To assess the correlation between the serum leptin concentration and ocular involvement in patients with Behçet's disease. METHODS: The study included 28 male consecutive patients with Behçet's disease ( group A, aged 19-59, median 35.5 years) and 15 male healthy control subjects ( group B, aged 25-45, median 35 years). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each subject at the study enrollment stage. We measured serum leptin, neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The age and BMI between the patients with ocular Behçet's disease and the control group were not different. White cell count and ESR values were found to be significantly higher among patients with Behçet's disease and ocular involvement (p<0.001). The median serum leptin concentrations were as follows: group A: 2.66 (0.57-7.02 ng/ml) and in group B: 2.55 (1.55-7.82 ng/ml). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: Serum leptin level does not correlate with ocular involvement in patients with Behçet's disease.
