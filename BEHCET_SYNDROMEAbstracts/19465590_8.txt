 OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical characteristics of patients living in France and carrying a single MEFV mutation. METHOD: A retrospective chart review of patients referred to us for recurrent fevers. Genetic testing: systematic screening of exons 2 and 10 was performed in the MEFV gene. A subset of patients was also investigated for other auto-inflammatory genes. RESULTS: We analysed 94 patients (sex ratio:1). Forty-two percent of them were Jews and 17% were Arabs. The median age of onset was 2 years (3 months-47 years). Fever was >39 degrees C in 80% of them, while the duration and frequency of an attack varied (<24 h: 8%; 1-3 days: 56%; >3 days: 36%; >2 months: 15%; 1-2 months: 48%; and <1 month: 37%, respectively). Peritonitis occurred in 97%, pleuritis in 25%, arthralgia in 53%; skin rashes in 20%, aphthosis in 18% and lymphadenopathy in 9%. MEFV mutations were M694V (60%) and M694I (7%). The R92Q TRAPS mutation was retrieved in 3/21 patients tested and the V377I MKD mutation in 1/6. Associated diseases in these patients were periodic fever, aphthosis pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome (4), AS (5), Crohn's disease (2) and Castleman's disease (1). CONCLUSION: The clinical picture of French heterozygote patients with recurrent fevers resembles that of homozygote patients. Most of them required colchicine treatment.
