OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of Th-2 cell-mediated diseases, such as atopic diseases, has been noted to be low in Th-1 cell-mediated diseases. This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of atopy and atopic diseases in Beh√ßet's disease (BD), a Th-1 cell-mediated disease, and to investigate the clinical association between the atopy and the development of severe manifestations in BD. METHODS: We examined 70 consecutive BD patients and 113 controls without BD or other inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The cumulative history of severe manifestations in BD patients was investigated during the disease course. A skin prick test was performed in all the subjects, and atopy was defined as present when the size of one or more allergen-induced wheals was equal to or larger than that caused by histamine. Atopic diseases were defined as present when there were relevant responses for atopic diseases on the questionnaires in the subjects with atopy. In addition, serum IgE levels and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of atopy and atopic diseases was significantly lower in BD patients than in controls. Other atopy parameters, such as serum IgE levels and peripheral blood eosinophil counts, were also significantly lower in BD patients when compared with controls. However, atopy, serum IgE levels, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts did not differ significantly between BD patients with and without severe manifestations. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Th-2 cell-mediated conditions, such as atopy and atopic diseases, appeared to be lower in BD, a Th-1 cell-mediated disease. In addition, a Th-1 and Th-2 balance may not influence the development of severe manifestations in BD.
