A 30-year-old man with a history of skin and recurrent oral ulceration over 1 year developed loss of visual acuity in the right eye. The diagnosis of acute frosted branch angiitis was based on retinal vasculitis associated with retinal edema and hemorrhages, confirmed using fluorescein angiography (venous leakage and extensive staining of the vein walls). General examination revealed pseudofolliculitis and recurrent oral ulcers. The diagnosis of Behçet's disease was based on the international criteria. The patient was treated with prednisolone and colchicine, which were effective with a normalization of the fundus 1 month later. The initial presentation of Behçet's disease as frosted branch angiitis is exceptional, the main differential diagnosis being herpetic infections, which must be ruled out.
