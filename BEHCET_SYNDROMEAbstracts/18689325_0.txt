The purpose of this report is to describe the case of a 46-year-old Comorian man in whom presentation with right hemiparesia with buccal and genital ulcerations lead to diagnosis of Behçet's disease. The most remarkable aspect of this case is the patient's ethnic group since Behçet's disease is less frequent in Africans than Caucasians. The most likely explanation for this difference is the absence of genetic susceptibility linked to HLAB51 that is rare in Africans. However lack of awareness of Behçet's disease and changes in environmental triggers in Africa cannot be ruled out.
