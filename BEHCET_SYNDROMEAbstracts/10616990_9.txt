BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease involving aortic regurgitation is rare, and prosthetic valve detachment after aortic valve replacement is one of the most serious complications reported. We investigated the surgical results in 10 patients with aortic regurgitation caused by Behçet's disease. METHODS: Between 1981 and 1997, 10 patients with aortic regurgitation secondary to Behçet's disease had surgery. There were 8 men and 2 women, and their ages ranged from 33 to 60 years (mean, 46+/-8 years). The surgical procedures for aortic regurgitation were aortic valve replacement in 6 patients and Bentall type operation in 4. RESULTS: No patient died during the hospital stay. The follow-up periods ranged from 11 to 185 months (mean, 87 months). Two patients died during the follow-up period. The acturial survival rate was 89% at 5 years and 67% at 10 years. Prosthetic valve detachment or suture detachment requiring redo operation occurred in 4 patients, 3 of whom had redo operations twice. Four patients had a composite graft replacement, and 1 patient died after the operation. No prosthetic valve detachment was noted in 64% of the patients at 5 years and in 43% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of prosthetic valve detachment was 40% (4 of 10 patients), with a higher incidence in patients with Behçet's disease than in those treated during the same period at the same hospital for aortitis caused by other diseases. Surgical techniques for treatment of this condition should be modified to improve the surgical outcome in these patients.
