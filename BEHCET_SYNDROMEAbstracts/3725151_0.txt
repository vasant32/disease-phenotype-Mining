In order to verify the immunostimulant effect of thymus humoral factors, a bovine thymic extract (TP 1-Thymostimulin) was given to 9 patients affected by primary immunodeficiency (mild deficit T/B combined) and to 8 patients affected by acquired immunodeficiency because of old age, lung neoplasm or with recurrent herpes simplex labialis. 6 patients affected by chronic hepatitis HBsAg+ and 1 patient affected by Behçet's syndrome were also studied. At the end of the study, after six months, all the patients with primary or acquired immunodeficiency showed a normalization of their immunological parameters and a clinical improvement. A clinical improvement was also observed in the patients affected by lung neoplasm. Instead, patients suffering from chronic active hepatitis HBsAg+ showed unsatisfactory results; the study did not reveal any clinical or immunological improvement in these cases. The patient affected by Behçet's syndrome showed a decreased recurrent uveitis.
