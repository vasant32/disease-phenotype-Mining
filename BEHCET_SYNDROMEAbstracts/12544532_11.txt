Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent oral aphthae and systemic manifestations. Gastrointestinal involvement is rare. We report a case of ileocolitis secondary to Behçet's successfully treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody (infliximab) therapy. To our knowledge this is the second reported case of Behçet's ileocolitis successfully treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.
