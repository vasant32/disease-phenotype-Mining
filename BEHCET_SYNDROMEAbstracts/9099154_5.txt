Herein we report a patient with Behçet's like syndrome, idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia, opportunistic infections, and a large polyclonal population of TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells. Microfluorimetric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed CD4+ T-cell counts of 10 +/- 5/mm3. The CD3+ T cells were 99% TCR alpha beta +, of which 74 +/- 5% were CD4- CD8-. No clonal populations were detected by southern analysis for T-cell receptor V beta gene rearrangements. No evidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection was present, although nocardia, candida, pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, and herpes infections were documented. The concomitant presence of opportunistic infections and a large population of TCR alpha beta + CD4- CD8- T cells suggests a pathogenic association and an intense immune response to microbial lipid or lipoglycan antigens presented in the context of CD1 molecules. This case demonstrates the potential for idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia to occur in Behçet's-like syndrome with lethal consequences.
