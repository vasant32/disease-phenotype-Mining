 OBJECTIVE: To investigate a potential relationship between I/D polymorphism within intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene located on human chromosome 17 and Behçet's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from 35 Turkish patients diagnosed with Behçet's disease according to the International Study Group criteria and 150 healthy individuals. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of I and D (insertion and deletion) alleles in intron 16 of the ACE gene in these DNA samples. RESULTS: We found differences in ACE I/D polymorphism between Behçet's disease and healthy controls (chi2=4.61, d.f.=1, p=0.044). In Behçet's disease patients, the D allele frequency was 84.3% and I allele frequency 15.7%. CONCLUSION: An association between Behçet's disease and ACE polymorphism may provide a useful basis for future molecular studies and therapeutic approaches in this complex disease.
