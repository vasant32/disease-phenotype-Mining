In a patient with active Behçet's syndrome, every needle puncture produces a pustule. We report herein a patient with Behçet's syndrome that presented as uveitis and erythema nodosum and developed later to the full blown picture of the disease. Reaction to a tuberculin test was found to be strongly positive, since it involved a needle puncture. The test was interpreted as if the patient was tuberculous.
