In order to determine the characteristics and incidence of hearing loss in Behçet's disease, 72 consecutive cases and 72 sex- and age-matched normal subjects were submitted to this study. Detailed audiologic tests were performed in all cases. Twenty patients (27%) showed some degree of hearing loss; but in only 7 patients (9%) was the average of the frequencies between 500 to 4,000 Hz more than 25 dB hearing level, and the cochlear function of 43 patients (59%) was within the 25-dB range in all frequencies. The averaged pure tone audiograms of the two groups showed a statistically significant hearing loss in the Behçet's group. No relationship could be found between hearing loss and other system involvements. There was no correlation between hearing loss and duration of the disease, but the mean age of the Behçet's patients with hearing loss was found to be significantly higher than the mean age of the patients without hearing loss.
