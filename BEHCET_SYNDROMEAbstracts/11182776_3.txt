We report the case of a patient who was admitted to the immunology unit of our medical facility. The patient had a history of recurrent oral ulcers, low-grade fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Echocardiographic examination revealed a right ventricular mass that was initially thought to be a myxoma in an unusual location, and the patient was sent to surgery. Surgery revealed the mass to be a thrombus. After 5 months of anticoagulation therapy, the patient was readmitted to our institution with the same complaints, and a right atrial thrombus was found on echocardiographic examination. After a careful reevaluation of the patient's history and episodes of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, as well as the papulopustular lesions found on his first admission to hospital, Beh√ßet's disease was diagnosed. The patient received thrombolytic therapy with a regression of thrombus, and continued with immunosuppressive and anticoagulation therapy. Five months later, echocardiographic examination showed complete disappearance of thrombus.
