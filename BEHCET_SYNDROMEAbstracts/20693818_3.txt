 PURPOSE: to describe the demographic characteristics and ocular manifestations of patients with late-onset Behçet disease (BD). Patients and Methods: The patients for this retrospective study were selected using the data obtained from the medical records of 16 patients with late-onset BD between January 2000 and May 2008. RESULTS: twelve (75%) of the cases were male and 4 (25%) were female. The mean age of patients was 53.8 ± 2.9 years (range, 51-60 years). The mean follow-up period was 4.3 ± 1.1 years (range, 3-8 years). Throughout the follow-up period, panuveitis, posterior uveitis, and anterior uveitis were detected in 11 (68.7%), 4 (25%) and 1 (6.2%) of 16 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: in our series, the most frequent type of uveitis was panuveitis and male sex seems to be a significant risk factor for developing panuveitis. Late-onset BD showed a marked preponderance of males with a sex ratio of 3:1.
