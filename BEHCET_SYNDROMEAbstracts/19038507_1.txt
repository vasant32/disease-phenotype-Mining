 OBJECTIVES: We have study the various associations between Behçet disease and alleles HLA class I and II in Moroccan population. The distribution of HLA alleles involved in the disease is assessed according to clinical signs and sex. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients suffering from Behçet's disease have been compared to healthy controls matched by age and ethnic origin. The HLA typing has been conducted by using microlymphocytotoxicity for the class I (A and B) and molecular biology (polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers) for the class II (DR and DQ). RESULTS: In addition to the allele B51, -A2, -B5102, -B58 and -B72 predispose to the Behçet's disease and the alleles A23, -A33, -B18, -B41 and -B49 have a negative correlation in our Moroccan patients. The alleles A2 and -B72 are specific to men, -A68 and -B58 to women, whereas -B51 and -B5102 are predisposing to the Behçet's disease of both genders. The allele B51 is related to the mucous manifestations, -B72 to the vascularitis manifestations and -B58 to the cutaneous manifestations. The haplotypes A2-B51 has a high positive correlation with this Behçet's disease. Concerning class II, none of the alleles DRB1* is implicated in the pathology even though the allele DQB1*02 ensures the patients' protection. CONCLUSIONS: The allele HLA-B51 shows a high positive correlation with the Behçet's disease. Other genetic factors seem to be implicated in susceptibility or protection against the disease.
