 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of vitrectomy in vitreo-retinal complications associated with intermediate uveitis. METHODS: Retrospective case series of sixteen eyes of 16 patients in vitreo-retinal disease associated with intermediate uveitis in a 3-year period from Mar 2002 to Jun 2005 were included in the study. They were treated with vitrectomy and the mean follow-up was (14.25 +/- 7.90) months (range: 5-32 months). Visual acuity in final follow-up, post-operative complications and the recurrence of intermediate uveitis were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Four patients were associated with tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or Behcet disease, respectively. The remaining 12 cases had idiopathic diseases. Pre-operatively, all patients were treated with steroids for a long time and the mean treatment time was (9.94 +/- 2.67) months (range: 6-16 months). Pre-operative vitreo-retinal complications included severe vitreous organization (5 eyes), tractional retinal detachment (6 eyes), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1 eye), vitreous hemorrhages (2 eyes), epimacular membrane (2 eyes) accompanied with vitreous tissue, and peripheral retinal neovascularization (16 eyes). In the post-operative period, tractional retinal detachment in one eye and complicated cataract in 3 eyes were observed. Post-operatively, only 4 cases need long-term immunosuppression therapy (more than 6 months). Fourteen of 16 eyes achieved a final visual acuity equal to or better than baseline (X2 = 4.923, P < 0.05). Recurrent intermediate uveitis was not found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that pars plana vitrectomy may have a beneficial effect on the intermediate uveitis which was severe or uncontrolled by immunosuppressive drugs and accompanied with vitreo-retinal complications. The beneficial effects include improving visual acuity, reducing need for long-term immunosuppression treatment.
