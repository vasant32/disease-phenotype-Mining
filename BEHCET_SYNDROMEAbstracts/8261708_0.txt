A 31-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of recurrent uveitis with oral aphthae for four years, and subacute double incontinence with spastic paraparesis under a clinical diagnosis of neuro-Behçet's disease. She was found to have high titers of anti-HTLV-I antibody in the serum, the cerebrospinal fluid and the aqueous humor, and a diagnosis of HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM) with HTLV-I uveitis was confirmed. The neurological symptoms improved transiently with prednisolone therapy. HTLV-I uveitis is known sometimes complicated with HAM. The neurological features together with uveitis in the present case were allied to those of neuro-Behçet's disease. Therefore, HAM with uveitis should be differentiated from neuro-Behçet's disease.
