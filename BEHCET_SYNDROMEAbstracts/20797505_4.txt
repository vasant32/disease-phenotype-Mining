Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that is considered a causative agent of peptic ulcer disease, gastric lymphoma, and gastric carcinoma. H pylori triggers an intense leucocyte infiltration of the gastric submucosa, an action that is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines. Because this pathogenetic mechanism is common to many other diseases, H pylori seroprevalence has also been investigated in other diseases. H pylori seropositivity is associated with various dermatologic disorders. Although the precise role of H pylori is unknown in these diseases, the organism can be eradicated, using simple and reliable drug regimens. This contribution highlights the dermatologic diseases associated with H pylori seropositivity.
