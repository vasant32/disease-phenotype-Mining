PURPOSE: To investigate pathogenesis underlying endogenous uveitis, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was quantified in sera of patients. METHODS: Sera were obtained from the 55 patients with uveitis (24 with Behçet's disease; 9 with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's [VKH] disease; 22 with sarcoidosis) and 58 healthy control subjects. MIF levels were determined by a human MIF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The mean MIF levels in the sera of the patients with Behçet's disease, VKH disease, and sarcoidosis and of healthy control subjects were 60.4+/-9.0 (mean+/-SE) ng/ml, 16.5+/-2.9 ng/ml, 27.1+/-5.6 ng/ml, and 5.4+/-0.04 ng/ml, respectively. The average levels of MIF in the sera of uveitis patients were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those of healthy control subjects. The high levels of MIF were especially noted in patients with Behçet's disease at the ocular exacerbation stage and patients with sarcoidosis at the severe uveitis stage. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of MIF in sera was characteristic of uveitis, and MIF may be a usefull laboratory parameter to use to comprehend the clinical course of uveitis.
