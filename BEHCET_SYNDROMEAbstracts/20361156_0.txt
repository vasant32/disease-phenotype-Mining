Behçet disease is a systemic disease with diverse clinical symptoms which vary according to the organs and systems involved. Typically, patients have oral and genital ulcers and episodic ocular involvement with periods of clinical improvement. We report an 18-year-old mole presenting with chest pain and hemoptysis and a history of ulcers in the oral cavity and scrotum. A chest CAT scan showed a mass located adjacent to the heart that a pulmonary arteriography defined as a left pulmonary artery aneurism. The patient was operated, excising left inferior pulmonary lobe. Due to skin and ocular involvement, the patient complied with criteria for Behçet disease. Immunosuppressive treatment with prednisone and azathioprine was started and the patient was discharged from the hospital.
