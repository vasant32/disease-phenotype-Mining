A 65-year-old man with Behçet's disease developed transient complete A-V block with syncope. An attempt to implant a permanent transvenous endocardial electrode failed owing to obstructions in the subclavian, innominate, and superior vena cava veins demonstrated by angiography. Sutureless epicardial electrodes were successfully implanted through a subxyphoid approach. Obstruction in the great veins is a common feature in patients with Behçet's disease. We suggest that patients with this disorder, who require a permanent pacemaker, should be investigated by angiography prior to implant to rule out obstruction in the upper great veins.
