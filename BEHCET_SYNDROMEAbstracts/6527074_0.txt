Etiologic research into caval syndromes enables distinction to be made between superior caval thrombosis, when there is generally a local cause, and inferior caval lesions that are usually of a general origin. Acute disseminated lupus erythematosus and Beh√ßet's disease should be investigated for, particularly in young patients, when an inflammatory syndrome is detected, and when the thrombus lies in the inferior cava territory.
