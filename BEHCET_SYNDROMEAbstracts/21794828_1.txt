Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis, with a more aggressive course in young males. Orogenital ulcers, uveitis and cutaneous lesions are the most frequent manifestations. We analyzed the effects of adalimumab on six patients with BD pretreated with inmunosupressive therapy, two of whom had received infliximab. We observed a good clinical response in all patients. To date, after a mean follow-up of 26.8 months, patients continue receiving adalimumab, with good clinical control, no adverse effects have been reported with adalimumab.
