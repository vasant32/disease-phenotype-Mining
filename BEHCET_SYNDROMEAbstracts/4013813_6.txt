Transcatheter embolization of a pulmonary artery aneurysm in Beh√ßet's disease has rarely been attempted. A report is presented of a case with four pulmonary aneurysms and massive hemoptysis. Transcatheter embolization was successfully performed in three of these aneurysms, with clinical improvement during a follow-up period of 11 months. Technical problems, hazards, and indications for embolization in these patients are discussed.
