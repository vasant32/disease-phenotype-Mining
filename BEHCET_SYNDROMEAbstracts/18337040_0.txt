 PURPOSE: This study aims to demonstrate pulmonary alterations (PA) in patients with Behcet's disease by using CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTs of 50 patients with Behcet's disease and 20 others in a control group have been evaluated retrospectively for PA (septal, reticular, nodular, atelectatic opacities). RESULTS: Eight out of 50 patients (16%) with Behcet's disease showed PA. Three out of 20 (15%) in the control group showed PA. No differences were observed between Behcet's disease patients and the control group regarding pulmonary alterations (p=0.917). No differences were observed in the disease duration, ages and sex in either group in those with and without PA. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary alterations can be seen in patients with Behcet's disease, but these alterations are not significant.
