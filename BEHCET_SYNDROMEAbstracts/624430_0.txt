Histocompatibility antigens (HL-A) were studied in a family with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). All who had symptoms or signs of BD had either HL-A B5 or BW35, or both. The increased number of families with BD recently reported supports the suggestion that positive family history may assist the diagnosis of BD.
