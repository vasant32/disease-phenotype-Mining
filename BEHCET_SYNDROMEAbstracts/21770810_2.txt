 PURPOSE: To report 2 cases of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) associated with Beh√ßet disease (BD). DESIGN: Small case series. METHODS: Review of two patients' charts, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: The authors report two young patients, diagnosed with BD, who developed decreased vision secondary to BRAO for the first patient and cilioretinal artery occlusion associated with branch retinal vein occlusion for the second patient. In the two cases, artery occlusion was associated with active intraocular inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: BRAO, with subsequent transient or permanent visual impairment, is an additional ocular complication of BD.
