We treated 123 patients with Beh√ßet's disease during a period of 10 years (1984-1993). The ocular lesions include uveal lesions especially the posterior lesions and vascular retinal. Uveitis was total in 72% of cases. Periphlebitis occurred in 51% of cases, vein occlusion in 10% of cases, macular oedema in 16% and papillary oedema in 10%. Clinical course and prognosis were studied. The functional prognosis is poor as such lesions may lead to blindness, particularly due to papillary oedema maculopathy. The treatment used is based on immunosuppressive and corticoid steroid drugs.
