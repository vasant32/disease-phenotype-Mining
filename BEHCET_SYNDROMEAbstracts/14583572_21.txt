 OBJECTIVE: To assess potential associations between Korean Beh√ßet's disease (BD) or other rheumatic diseases with vasculitis and two polymorphisms of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene, which include the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 and a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 4. METHODS: 65 patients with BD, 27 with rheumatic diseases with vasculitis, and 80 controls were studied. Analyses of the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 and VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of the eNOS gene were made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique and PCR genotyping, respectively. Additionally, HLA-B51 typing was performed in the BD group and controls by a two step PCR sequence-specific primers method. RESULTS: Significant differences in Glu298Asp genotype frequencies were found between the BD or vasculitis groups and the controls (BD group v controls: p(corr)=0.006; vasculitis group v controls: p<0.001). The Asp298 frequency was much higher in the BD and vasculitis groups than in the controls. Even after stratification of the BD group based on the results of HLA-B51 testing, a significant association of the Glu298Asp polymorphism was still found (p=0.002, Mantel-Haenszel weighted odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 10.9). Distribution of the genotype frequencies in two eNOS gene polymorphisms was similar in connective tissue diseases-associated vasculitis and primary vasculitic syndromes. In contrast, distribution of alleles and genotypes of VNTR polymorphism did not differ between BD or vasculitis groups and the controls. CONCLUSION: The Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of the eNOS gene seems to be a susceptibility gene for Korean BD and other rheumatic diseases.
