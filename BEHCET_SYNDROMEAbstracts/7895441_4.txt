A patient with neuro-Behcet disease is described. SPECT using Tc-99m HMPAO was performed to evaluate brain perfusion. The brain SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the right frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. MRI showed high intensity lesions in the white matter in the right periventricular centrum semiovale and frontal region on T2 weighted images. Gray matter abnormalities were evident on brain SPECT, but not on MRI. Brain SPECT using Tc-99m HMPAO may provide useful clinical information on regional cerebral cortical abnormalities associated with neuro-Behcet disease.
