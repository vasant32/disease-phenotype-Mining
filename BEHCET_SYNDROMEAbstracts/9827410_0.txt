Medullary ischemia is an uncommon and serious complication of subrenal aortic surgery. It generally occurs after surgery for ruptured aneurysms and second operations on the aorta. We report the case of a 29-year-old patient who had Beh√ßet's disease with multiple arterial complications. The patient underwent emergency surgery for ruptured aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. An aorto-aortic prosthetic graft was implanted. The postoperative period was complicated by paraplegia and thrombosis of the prosthetic graft with dissection of the iliac arteries. The patient was reoperated and an aorto-bifemoral bypass was installed. After two years, the patient has recovered part of his neurological deficiency. The pathogenesis of this complication is well known, but prevention remains a challenge.
