 BACKGROUND: Arterial involvement is rarely described in Behcet disease BD and it is associated with poor prognosis. AIM: We report our experience with a rare and interesting subset of Behcet disease patients with arterial involvement: thrombosis and aneurysm formation types of angio-BD. METHODS: From 1994 to 2008, seven cases of arterial BD with 3 aneurysm formation and 4 thrombosis were found amongst BD patients in the department of internal medicine of Habib Thameur Hospital. RESULTS: Combination of venous and arterial manifestations occurred in 4 patients. All patients were male and the mean age when arterial involvement manifested was diagnosed was about 39.3. The artery most often affected is the aorta followed by the pulmonary arteries. Brain infraction occurred in about 4 cases. Pericarditis and neurological symptoms were more frequently noted in patients with arterial BD than others without vasculo-Behcet disease. All patients underwent corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. Two patients were successfully operated for aneurysms. All patients were alive after a mean of 7.8 years follow-up. CONCLUSION: Arterial involvement is more frequently noted in vasculo-Behcet than venous thrombosis and it's associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate.
