Adamantiades-Behcet's disease (ABD) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disorder. Although the precise etiology is unclear, high prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 predisposition and predominantly involved T-helper type 1 cells (Th1)-type proinflammatory cytokines and extrinsic Streptococcal infection suggest a substantial association with an immunogenetic basis and strengthens the hypothesis that IL-12, a potent inducer of Th-1 immune reaction, is a putative candidate in its pathogenesis. These clinicopathological findings led us to examine interleukin 12 p40 (IL-12B) promoter polymorphism, for which the 4-base pair (bp) heterozygous insertion has been shown to affect the gene transcription and subsequent protein production. We analyzed IL-12B promoter genotypes in 194 Japanese subjects (92 with ABD and 102 normal controls) by PCR-based restriction enzyme digestion. The frequency of the insertion heterozygosity was significantly higher in patients than in controls (49/92, 53.3% vs 39/102, 38.2%, respectively). Comparing these with HLA haplotype data, this trend was more significant in HLA-B51-negative patients (29/42, 69.0% vs 20/50, 40.0%; P = 0.005). As assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA, stimulation with Streptococcal antigens specifically increased expression of IL-12 p40 mRNA and protein, in conjunction with IL-12 p70 induction, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from heterozygous patients. Our results provide evidence for anti-bacterial host response toward Th1-immunity mediated by IL-12 in patients with ABD, and the possible insight into the genetic susceptibility that is independent of HLA background.
