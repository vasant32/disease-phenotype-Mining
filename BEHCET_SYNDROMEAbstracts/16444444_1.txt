Beh√ßet disease (BD) is a chronic relapsing systemic vasculitic disorder affecting the arteries, veins, and vessels of any size. Vascular lesions in BD usually represent an occlusive nature suggesting a hypercoagulable/ prothrombotic state. Coronary arteries are rarely involved in BD. In this report, a 27-year-old male patient in whom myocardial infarction developed secondary to coronary arterial thrombosis together with deep venous thrombosis was presented. This is a review of the pathologic hemostasis and the prothrombotic state of BD.
