We report a patient with vasculo-Behçet's disease treated successfully with a high dose of prednisolone. In 2002, the patient was diagnosed with vasculo-Behçet's disease. He was admitted to our hospital because of sudden-onset right lower back pain in June 2006. Upon admission, abdominal angiography revealed aneurysmal dilatations of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. He was treated promptly with high-dose prednisolone, after which the aneurysms displayed no further enlargement. As we believe this case to be quite rare, we report this case with a literature review in support of this characterization.
