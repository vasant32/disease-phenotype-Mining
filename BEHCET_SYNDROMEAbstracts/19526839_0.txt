Neuro-Behçet disease (NBD) can be categorized clinically as the acute type--characterized by meningoencephalitis--and the chronic progressive type- characterized by slowly progressive dementia, ataxia, and dysarthria. We describe a 35-year clinical course of NBD that was characterized by slowly progressive ataxia and dysarthria despite continued corticosteroid treatment. Because of difficulties in swallowing, which interrupted oral corticosteroid therapy, this case was characterized by recurrent manifestations of neurological symptoms and abnormal MRI findings. Resumption of corticosteroid therapy was effective. The patient was a 77-year-old woman who had presented with oral ulceration and dysarthria at the age of 42. She suffered from Entero-Behçet disease at the age of 52 and was treated with corticosteroids for 7 years. Oral corticosteroid therapy was resumed at the age of 64, but her neurological deficit slowly progressed and she developed paraplegia with dysphagia and dysarthria. Corticosteroids treatment was interrupted when she was 76; one year later, she was hospitalized in a state of somnolence. Brain MRI scans revealed new lesions with gadolinium enhancement. We diagnosed acute exacerbation of NBD attacks on the basis of positive findings for HLA-B51, protein elevation, and IL-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Corticosteroid treatment was effective. She became alert, and her MRI findings were no longer abnormal. Corticosteroids administration was continued via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Our case suggested that even if neurological exacertion is not obvious during the clinical course, immunosuppressive therapies should be continued for patients with chronic NBD to prevent acute aggravation.
