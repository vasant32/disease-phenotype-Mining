The results of a treatment with ciclosporin A in 4 patients with severe uveitis (2 cases with Beh√ßet's disease, 2 cases Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease) are presented. Ciclosporin A produced a rapid regression of exudates in the ocular fundus and of the inflammatory signs at the anterior segment in the 4 cases. However, at the same time, side effects including the deterioration of the hepatorenal function developed. Interruption of the treatment with ciclosporin A led to the development of inflammation at the anterior and posterior segments in cases 2 and 4.
