We report a 48-year-old patient with neuro-Behcet's disease who presented with the combination of severe memory impairment and frontal/executive dysfunction. The clinical feature mimicked that of diencephalic amnesic syndrome. The MRI and SPECT findings supported the notion that the thalamus and related subcortical-frontal connection was responsible for this patient's problem.
