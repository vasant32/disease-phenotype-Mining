The radiographic, colonoscopic, and pathologic findings in this case of Behcet's colitis differ completely from ulcerative or granulomatous colitis as well as from other, less commonly seen inflammatory colitides. Discrete, peptic-type ulcers, with normal intervening mucosa and normal overall configuration of the colon, are seen on radiography and endoscopy. The angiographic features are not diagnostic but differ considerably from findings in other inflammatory colitides. No tortuous arterioles, mucosal hyperemia or early venous filling was encountered.
