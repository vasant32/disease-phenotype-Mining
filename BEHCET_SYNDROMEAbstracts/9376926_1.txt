Ocular Behçet's disease is characterized by a very poor visual prognosis. Twelve patients which had a maintenance treatment with immunosuppressors received 30 intravenous i.v. bolus of corticoids for uncontrolled severe retinal vasculitis (macular edema 58% of cases) and papillitis (100% of cases) (1 bolus treatment = 0.5-2 g of i.v. methylprednisolone once a day, for 3 days). In addition, oral immunosuppression was moderately increased in order to prevent further recurrences. Tolerance was good in all cases. Visual acuity (VA) remained stable or improved after one month in 87% of cases following the bolus treatment. In 92%, the VA remained stable or improved for a mean follow-up of 6 years. These good results suggest that intravenous bolus of steroids is a safe and efficient therapy which may prevent further decrease of the visual acuity and may reduce the side effects of the immunosuppressive treatment needed to control severe posterior uveitis in Behçet's disease.
