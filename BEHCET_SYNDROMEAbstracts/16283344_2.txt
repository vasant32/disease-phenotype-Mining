Glutathione S-transferases (GST) play an important role in oxidative stress related syndromes. An imbalance of the oxidant and antioxidant systems is important in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease (BD). The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of null genotypes of GST-M1 and GST-T1 with BD since some preliminary molecular genetic data were recently published. Ninety-four Turkish BD patients (42 male, 52 female, 37.1+/-10.4 years) and 140 healthy volunteers (70 male, 70 female, 36.8+/-11.7 years) matched for age and gender with the patients as the control group were included in the study. Distributions of GST-M1 and GST-T1 genotypes were determined by multiplexed PCR using three sets of primers for GST-M1, GST-T1, and beta-globulin genes. There was no association between BD and the frequencies of GST-M1 and GST-T1 null genotypes when compared to controls by separate analysis. However, by cross and pooled combination analysis there was a significant association between the frequencies of pooled GSTs with one or both null genotypes in BD and controls. This is the first evidence that the association between the frequencies of GST-M1 and GST-T1 null genotypes and BD might be dependent on the interaction of multiple null allele polymorphisms rather than a single null allele of GST-M1 and GST-T1.
