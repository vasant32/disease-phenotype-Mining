OBJECTIVE: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a vasculitis mainly observed in young adult males. Juvenile BD is rare and only small series of pediatric cases have been reported. The objective of this study was to define the epidemiology and clinical features of BD among Israeli children. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 8 pediatric rheumatology units in Israel and 30 cases of BD diagnosed before the age of 16 years were identified. RESULTS: Fifteen patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for BD, while 15 had an incomplete form of BD. Among the patients with complete BD, stomatitis and skin involvement were the most common manifestations. Other symptoms included genital ulcers, uveitis, CNS involvement, arthritis, and gastrointestinal involvement. A positive family history was elicited in 3 patients. HLA B5 was found in 7 of 12 patients (58%). The 15 patients with incomplete BD all had recurrent stomatitis; other manifestations included uveitis, arthritis, and genital ulcers. HLA B5 was found in 94% of this group. CONCLUSION: Juvenile BD in Israel is not uncommon, and is frequently associated with HLA B5 positivity. This could indicate a genetic susceptibility in our region. Half of the patients in our series had an incomplete form of BD, which may represent a less severe variant of the disease. In any case, careful follow-up is required, since their condition could eventually evolve into complete BD.
