Behçet's syndrome, a multisystem disorder, is characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcerations, eye lesions, and skin changes. Other manifestations, although rare, may affect the nervous, gastrointestinal, or locomotor system, as well as veins and arteries. Vascular lesions occur in approximately 30% of reported cases. Although thrombosis in the larger veins is frequent, arterial thrombosis is somewhat less likely to occur. Only a few cases of arterial aneurysm have been documented in the literature. This report describes a patient who had suffered from Behçet's syndrome for fifteen years and in whom a complete obstruction of the inferior vena cava was demonstrated. An aortoiliac bypass was performed successfully, and the patient had had a good clinical recovery at long-term follow-up.
