Behçet's disease is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disorder that affects many organs. A 48-year-old man with known Behçet's disease was admitted to the emergency department with aggravating severe back pain and left lower quadrant pain. A contained rupture of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was discovered with a maximum diameter of 10 cm. The patient's severe back pain was due to erosion of the third lumbar vertebra.
