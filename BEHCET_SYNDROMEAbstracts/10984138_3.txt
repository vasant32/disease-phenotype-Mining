We present the case of a young woman suffering from both ankylosing spondylitis and Behçet's disease, associated with a severe inflammatory arthritis. Although the HLA phenotype was positive for HLA-B27 and negative for HLA-B5, the clinical findings, especially the joint manifestations of Behçet's disease, seem to appear dominantly. The meaning of this rare combination was discussed with a review of the literature.
