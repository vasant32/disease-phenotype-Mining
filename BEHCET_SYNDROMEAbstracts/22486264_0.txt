 PURPOSE: To compare infliximab monotherapy with infliximab and colchicine combination therapy in Behçet's disease. METHODS: Clinical records of 14 Behçet's disease patients who were administered infliximab with or without colchicine were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who were given other immunosuppresants after initiation of infliximab therapy were excluded. The frequency of ocular attacks and best-corrected visual acuity were investigated. RESULTS: Seven patients received monotherapy and 7 received combination therapy. The mean frequency of ocular attacks significantly decreased from 2.14 to 0.22 per 6 months in monotherapy group and from 2.57 to 0.18 per 6 months in combination therapy group. No significant difference was observed between both groups in the frequency of ocular attacks and in changes in best-corrected visual acuity during 0 to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is as efficacious as infliximab and colchicines together in Behçet's disease treatment. This study suggests that colchicine administration is not necessary in Behçet's disease patients receiving infliximab.
