Samples of serum from patients with ocular manifestation of Behçet's disease of various types were analyzed using acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase as lysosomal marker enzymes, in comparison to those from control patients with myopia, retinal detachment, and uveitis of unknown etiology. The lysosomal enzyme activities in Behçet's disease, especially in the attack phase, were found to be higher than those of the controls. In the sera of two patients with Behçet's disease, the activities in the attack phase were slightly higher than in the remission phase. It was suggested that the ocular symptoms in Behçet's disease might represent exacerbation better than other symptoms, in view of the high lysosomal enzyme activities in the attack phase, as classified by ocular symptoms alone.
