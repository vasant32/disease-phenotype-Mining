 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of cytochrome p450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to Beh√ßet's disease (BD) in Taiwan. METHODS: The polymorphisms of CYP1A1 and MnSOD genes were determined in 51 patients with BD and 91 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. RESULTS: The frequencies of CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A were significantly increased in patients with BD. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the frequencies of MnSOD gene polymorphisms between patients with BD and controls. Linkage disequilibrium was found between CYP1A1 4889G and CYP1A1 6235C in controls and patients with BD. However, a similar finding could not be found between CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A. We also found that the association of CYP1A1 4889G with BD was dependent on the presence of CYP1A1 4887A. On the other hand, the association of CYP1A1 4887A with BD was dependent on the presence of CYP1A1 4889G. An additive effect of CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A on the susceptibility to BD could be found. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous presence of CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A is associated with development of BD in Taiwan.
