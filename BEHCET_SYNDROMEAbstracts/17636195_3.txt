Pulmonary and cardiac involvement in Behçet disease is rare but can cause life-threatening complications. This report presents computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography findings in 3 patients with Behçet disease. Imaging findings were confirmed by surgery in 1 patient and by angiography in another. One patient had bilateral pulmonary artery aneurysms, 1 of which had already ruptured and had thrombosed. The other had unilateral pulmonary artery aneurysm and thrombosis accompanied with intracardiac thrombus formation. The third patient had unilateral pulmonary artery aneurysm, thrombus, and coronary artery aneurysm. As in our case, there have been rare reports of coronary artery disease and intracardiac thrombus formation associated with pulmonary vascular involvement. Noninvasive imaging modalities minimize any risk of endothelial damage and can be an alternative to angiography in assessment of pulmonary and cardiac involvement in Behçet disease.
