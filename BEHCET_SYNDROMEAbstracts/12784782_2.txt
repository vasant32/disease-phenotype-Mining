The present case report describes the occurrence of an acute coronary syndrome and of a post-percutaneous coronary intervention complication in a patient with Beh√ßet's syndrome. An active phase of this syndrome, through an increased oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide availability, could explain both an early myocardial infarction as well as an infarction following late in-stent reocclusion. This complication can be very difficult to treat.
