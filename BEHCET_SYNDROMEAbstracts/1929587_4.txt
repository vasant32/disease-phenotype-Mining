The cutaneous response to intradermal injection of monosodium urate crystals was investigated in 97 patients with Beh√ßet's syndrome in Turkey and 14 in the United Kingdom, and in 82 healthy and 88 diseased controls. Urate crystals produced an increased erythematous response in patients compared with controls in both countries. This response was different from that of the pathergy test performed at the same time. The systemic acute phase response, studied only in Turkey, showed no differences between patients and controls.
