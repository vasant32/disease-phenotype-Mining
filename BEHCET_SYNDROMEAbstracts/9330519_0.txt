Patient was a 70-year-old female diagnosed as Behçet's disease 1973. She underwent descending thoracic aortic aneurysm operation 1980. She had graft replacement for a residual thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm on April 28, 1994. She didn't accept steroid therapy although she had a slight inflammatory reaction on admission. The graft replacement of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm was done with an aid of Carmeda closed chest support system bypass and segmental aortic cross clamping. Reattachment of the intercostal and lumbar arteries to the graft was used with button technique or interposition technique. Visceral branches including celiac axis, superior mesenteric and right renal arteries were reconstructed to an opening made in the graft with button technique and reattachment of left renal artery was used with graft interposition during selective perfusion of visceral arteries. She started steroid therapy with 5 mg of predonine to prevent inflammatory reaction postoperatively. The thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm accompanied with Behçet's disease was relatively rare and this is a long survival case.
