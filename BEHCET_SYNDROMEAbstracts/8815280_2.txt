Neopterin radioimmunoassay measurements (Henning, Berlin) were conducted in 26 male and 12 female patients (mean age 32 +/- 8.01) with Behcet's disease (BD) and healthy controls. In BD patients mean serum neopterin concentrations were significantly higher than in the controls (8.7 +/- 4.1 nmol/l against 5.0 +/- 1.9 nmol/l, respectively). Neopterin levels were higher in patients with positive pathergy test than in negative subjects (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between neopterin and CRP (rs=0.42. p<0.02). The findings indicate that cellular immunity in BD patients is activated.
