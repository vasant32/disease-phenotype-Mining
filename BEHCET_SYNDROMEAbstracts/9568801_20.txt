Behçet's disease (BD) is a recurrent systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. Genetic factors and infectious agents seem to be related to the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease. BD is strongly associated with HLA-B51 antigen in many ethnic groups. As there are differences in HLA profile in different ethnic groups, we designed this case-control study to examine the association of HLA-B51 alleles and BD as well as to investigate the influence of sex, age at development of the International Study Group (ISG) for Behçet's Disease criteria and certain features of disease severity on the strength of this association. The study includes 62 Greek BD patients who fulfill the ISG criteria for Behçet's disease and 87 controls. Serological HLA Class-I typing was performed by standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique. HLA-DNA typing for the B5 group was performed in all B51 subjects and controls by PCR-SSO. Allele B*5101 was found in 80% of BD patients and in 26% of controls (odds ratio (OR) 10.48, p < 10[-6]). Males who carry this allele have a higher risk than females for BD (OR 16.97 and 5.74 respectively). B*5101 predisposes to BD at a younger age in both sexes and to the development of erythema nodosum (OR = 11, p = 0.004). This was confirmed by multiple logistic regression analysis. A weak but not significant association was found between B*5101 and uveitis (OR = 2). No association was found between B*5101 and vasculitis or skin lesions in either sex. It was concluded that in the Greek population allele B*5101 is a predisposing marker for BD, as in most ethnic groups, and that this allele predisposes to the development of the disease at a younger age in both sexes and to the development of erythema nodosum.
