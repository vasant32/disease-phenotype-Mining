The aims of this study are to demonstrate the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the diagnosis and evaluation of vascular involvement in Behçet's disease. Twelve patients with vascular involvement due to Behçet's disease were included in this study. We believe that MRI and MRA are safe and noninvasive methods that can be used to confirm and monitor vascular Behçet's disease.
