The study was designed to investigate the possible correlation between some oxidative stress parameters in Behcet's disease and the clinical manifestations of the disease as well as the possible correlation with the disease severity. Seventy-six patients diagnosed according to the International Study Group criteria for Behcet's disease were included in the study. Sixty patients had mild-to-moderate disease and 16 patients had severe disease. Sixty matched control subjects were also included. After a full history and examination from each subject, 10 mL blood was drawn from each for analysis. Serum malondialdehyde, glutathione, ceruloplasmin, copper and zinc levels were determined. Patients with Behcet's disease showed increased levels of serum malondialdehyde and copper while glutathione and zinc levels were decreased. Comparison between these parameters in patients with mild-to-moderate disease with those with severe disease showed only that serum zinc levels were lower in severe Behcet's disease. Serum malondialdehyde levels were found to be significantly positively correlated with oral ulcer size, duration and frequency. Glutathione levels were found to be inversely correlated with the clinical manifestation index and all oral ulcer parameters. Zinc levels were found to be inversely correlated with the clinical manifestation index and pathergy test positivity grades. Copper levels were found to be positively correlated with oral ulcer number. Although the parameters of oxidative stress did not show correlation with disease severity, they were correlated with the disease manifestations. This points out the importance of oxidative stress in Behcet's disease.
