A 50-year-old woman who had been suffering from Behçet's disease came to our clinic. The patient developed recurrent oral aphthae, genital ulcers, and folliculitis when she was 25-year-old. In 1971 the diagnosis is of Behçet's disease was made and oral prednisolone was started. In 1976 oral and labial aphthae became worse, and after healing of these aphthae, adhesion of oral angle developed. At that time plastic surgery for adhesion was made. In 1990 the patient felt difficulty in opening the mouth again and operation for mouth was performed. In 1991 the patient was admitted to our hospital for the third time because of recurrent oral aphthae, vomitting, and dysphagia. Upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopic examination revealed that there was severe stenosis in the middle portion of esophagus. Above that lesion, dilatation of esophagus with retention of barium was observed. Forty mg/day of prednisolone with liquid meal was started, and operation for stenosis of the esophagus using bujie was performed twice. After that operation, the patient was able to take solid meals. Esophageal ulceration with Behçet's disease treated with prednisolone was reported and discussed with the review of the literture.
