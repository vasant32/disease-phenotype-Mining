BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disorder characterized by the triad of oral and genital ulcers and ocular lesions. The etiology is unknown. This is the first report giving details of the clinical manifestations of Behçet's disease in Jordanian patients. METHODS: Twenty patients with Behçet's disease were studied to determine the clinical pattern in the North of Jordan. The patients were seen in Princess Basma Teaching Hospital in North Jordan. They presented to various clinics and underwent full clinical examination. Data for each patient on all features of Behçet's disease were recorded on a standard form. A comparison was made between Behçet's disease in Jordan and other countries in the region. RESULTS: Of the 20 patients, 14 were men and six women, giving a ratio of 2.3:1. Their ages ranged from 14 to 58 years. All had mouth ulcers, 65% genital ulcers, 65% ocular involvement, 55% joint involvement, 35% skin lesions, 20% vascular lesions, and 5% gastrointestinal involvement. The oral ulcers were the first manifestation of the disease process in 70% of our patients. Skin lesions, genital ulcers, and involvement of the central nervous system and the pulmonary system were less frequent in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is difficult to obtain figures as to the incidence and prevalence of Behçet's disease in Jordan, the clinical manifestations, with a few exceptions, are similar to those in other countries in the region.
