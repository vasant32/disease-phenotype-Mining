PURPOSE: Describe the patterns and location of lesions seen on MR imaging in neuro-Behçet's disease. OBSERVATIONS: 33 patients with neuro-Behçet's disease (mean age: 27 years) imaged by MRI were reviewed. Most common neurologic symptoms included headaches and pyramidal signs. MRI examinations (Siemens Magnetom Impact 1 Tesla) included the following sequences: T1wi, T2wi, Flair, MPR-3D and MRA sequences. RESULTS: Parenchymal lesions were identified in 21 patients. Brainstem, internal capsule, cerebral white matter, basal ganglia were involved respectively in 14, 10, 7, and 5 cases. Vascular thrombosis (venous: n=7; arterial: n=1) were observed in eight. MRI was normal in four patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows the value of MR imaging for the exploration of parenchymal lesions of neuro-Behçet's and confirms the frequency of brainstem involvement.
