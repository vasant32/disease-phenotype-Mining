 PURPOSE: We investigated the frequencies and clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with uveitis. METHODS: Records of 189 patients referred from April 1999 to March 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (29.6%) had anterior uveitis, 13 (6.9%) intermediate uveitis, 59 (31.2%) posterior uveitis, 58 (30.7%) panuveitis, and three (1.6%) papillitis. The most common diagnoses were Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (10.1%), biopsy-proven or presumed sarcoidosis (9.5%), acute anterior uveitis (7.9%), tuberculosis (6.9%), and Behçet's disease (5.8%). Seventy-three patients (38.6%) were treated with local therapy alone, and 95 patients (50.3%) required systemic therapy. Ocular complications developed in 19.6% of patients, and systemic complications in 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm a continued high frequency of VKH disease and sarcoidosis, but suggest a decreased frequency of Behçet's disease and an increased frequency of tuberculosis. Roughly one-half of the patients required systemic treatment in addition to local therapy, and ocular and/or systemic complications developed in one-fifth of the patients.
