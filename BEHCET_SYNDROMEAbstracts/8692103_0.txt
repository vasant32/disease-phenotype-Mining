Behcet's disease is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology which usually occurs as a trait of symptoms: aphatous stomatitis, genital ulcerations and eye disease. Characteristic manifestations are frequent: erythema nodosum, arthralgias, arthritis, myalgias, phlebothrombosis and nervous system disorders as well as disorders of other organs and systems. Behcet's disease was discovered in 1937 for the first time by dermatovenerologist Hulusi Behcet (1889 - 1948) after whom it was named Behcet's disease or Behcet's syndrome. At the beginning of the disease the diagnosis is uncertain because of different schedule of certain manifestations and a long period up to the full clinical picture manifestation. As it is well known, the main changes occur at the buccal mucosa in a form of a recidivant aphthous and herpetiformis lesions. Genital ulcerations are present in 64 to 87% of patients. Changes which occur on eyes may be present in 28 - 80% of patients and may dominate the clinical picture. The skin is affected in about 50% of patients. Manifestations on joints occur at major joints of the lower limbs. Sometimes gastrointestinal manifestations occur as enterocolitis and ulcerous colitis. Nervous system lesions have poor prognosis. The treatment involves: acute exacerbations with multisystemic manifestations by utilization of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressive preparations. Corticosteroids are used in severe cases.
