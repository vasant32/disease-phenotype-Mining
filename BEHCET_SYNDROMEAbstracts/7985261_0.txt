A case of bilateral iliac artery aneurysms in a 24 year old patient with a Behçet-like disease is presented. Behçet's disease is characterized by multiple organ involvement. Primary manifestations are genital and oral mucosal ulcerations and eye and skin affections. Among secondary manifestations are non-specific arteritis causing thrombosis as well as aneurysmal disease of the medium-sized and large arteries. Behçet's disease should be considered in young patients with arterial aneurysms.
