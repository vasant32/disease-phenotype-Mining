Valve prolapse was diagnosed solely by echocardiography in three consecutive patients with Behçet's disease. Two patients had prolapse of the posterior mitral valve leaflet, but no clinical manifestations of valve prolapse. In the third patient aortic valve prolapse was associated with physical signs of aortic regurgitation and left ventricular failure. Valve prolapse in these cases may have resulted from structural and functional derangement caused by the underlying non-specific vasculitis that occurs in Behçet's disease.
