A 33-year-old male with Behçet's disease developed congestive heart failure without apparent etiology. Although an electrocardiogram and thallium-201 scintigraphy showed myocardial ischemic damage, there were no abnormalities detected in the coronary arteries. Echocardiographic studies and a left ventriculogram were compatible with congestive cardiomyopathy. These findings suggested that the patient had myocarditis, an unusual association with Behçet's disease.
