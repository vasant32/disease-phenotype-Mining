A 12 year-old boy suffering from Behçet's syndrome with an anal complication was presented. He had several anal ulcers with surrounding polypoid proliferations. Operative treatment and local application of steroid hormone to anal ulcer failed, whereas the general administration of steroid hormone improved his allover state so that the anal lesion almost completely healed. Dose of steroid hormone was gradually tapered off and finally stopped without any signs of recurrence. Anal ulcer seems to represent a rare complication of Behçet's syndrome.
