We observed 20 patients with ocular Beh√ßet's disease. During the episodes of exacerbation the main features were: deep retinal infiltrates and vascular occlusions which were responsible for a sudden decrease in visual acuity. Also, there is posterior uveitis and retinal edema which persists during the whole course of the disease. In the final stages we observed an avascular, atrophic retina. Most patients also presented with a striking maculopathy and very often an atrophic optic disc was associated. On time of diagnosis, most patients were in their third decade, ranging from 19 to 61 years of age. Treatment consisted in administration of topical and systemic steroids. Most patients also required immunosuppressives and immunomodulators (cyclosporine A) in a later stage of the disease.
