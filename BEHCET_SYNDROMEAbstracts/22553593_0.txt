We reported the case of a 39-year-old patient with inactive Behcet's syndrome developed capsule contraction syndrome after uneventful phacoemulsification and a foldable intraocular lens implantation. Two weeks after the operation, the patient was accepted to hospital with severe decrease of visual acuity (VA) on the operated eye. Capsule opening area had been reduced considerably by fibrotic tissue, which evaluated with full dilated pupil. Since capsule contraction syndrome (CCS) had been diagnosed in very early stage and which structure was not severely thick, the fibrotic band was treated successfully, 360 degree circular shape, by neodymium YAG (Nd:YAG) laser. Capsule opening area was remained stable during follow up period of one month. But a significant reocclusion was developed that need surgical reopening 3 months after initial operation. Continuous curvilinier capsulorhexis (CCC) may be recurred again after a successful treatment in patient with uveitis like Behcet's disease.
