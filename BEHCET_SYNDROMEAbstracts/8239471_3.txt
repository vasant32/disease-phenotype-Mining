The authors report twenty-eight cases of superior vena cava thrombosis. They try to establish a correlation between the radiological features of thrombosis and the etiology. The etiology was Behçet's disease in 64% of cases, lung cancers in 14%, the mediastinal tuberculosis in 14%, systemic lupus erythematosus in 3.5% and undetermined origin in 7%. A normal meiastinal appearance slight widening of the superior mediastinum is noted in Behçet's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and tuberculous mediastinal fibrosis. Superior vena cava thrombosis is extensive in Behçet's disease involving the subclavian vein and the azygos vein. An obvious widening of the mediastin is noted in lung cancers and tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
