Report of two cases of Behçet syndrome in children, one with the features of a neuro-Behçet syndrome and the other with chiefly severe ocular changes. Both children were treated with transfer factor when previous treatment had proved ineffective. Some years after the beginning of treatment, which is still continuing, transfer factor may be said to be of value in Behçet syndrome.
