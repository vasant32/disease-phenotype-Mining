 BACKGROUND: Intestinal Beh√ßet disease (BD) is characterized by intestinal inflammation with round and oval ulcers associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Although several cases have been reported that infliximab is effective for induction of remission, the efficacy of infliximab for maintaining remission is unknown. METHODS: Six cases with fulminant intestinal BD were treated with infliximab. All patients were steroid-dependent and refractory to immunosuppressants; 3 patients were treated with 6-mercaptopurine, 1 patient with azathioprine, 1 patient with cyclosporine A, and 1 patient with methotrexate. RESULTS: Four patients achieved remission by infliximab and all of these patients maintained remission with scheduled treatments of infliximab, with the longest duration of remission being about 3 years. Another 2 patients with ileal ulceration required surgery; however, 1 patient has maintained remission by scheduled treatment of infliximab for 2 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab appears to offer an option for fulminant intestinal BD to induce and maintain remission, although a randomized control trial is needed.
