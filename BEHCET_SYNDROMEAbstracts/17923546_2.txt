 OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27 and B51 double-positive Behçet uveitis and to determine whether the coexistence of HLA-B27 can affect Behçet uveitis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with Behçet uveitis and patients with HLA-B27-associated non-Behçet uveitis who underwent HLA-B27 and HLA-B51 typing and were followed up for more than 3 years. We divided the patients into 3 groups according to HLA-B27/B51 status and compared the clinical outcomes. Main outcome measures were demographic features, uveitis characteristics, complications, treatments, and visual prognosis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with HLA-B27(+)B51(+) Behçet uveitis, 43 patients with HLA-B27(-)B51(+) Behçet uveitis, and 41 patients with HLA-B27(+)B51(-) non-Behçet uveitis were identified. HLA-B27(+)B51(+) Behçet uveitis showed the demographic features similar to HLA-B27(-) counterparts. However, HLA-B27(+)B51(+) Behçet uveitis showed less involvement of posterior segments, a less chronic course, fewer complications in posterior segments, and less use of systemic medication or surgical intervention for inflammatory control, similar to HLA-B27(+)B51(-) non-Behçet uveitis. The long-term vision prognosis of HLA-B27(+)B51(+) Behçet uveitis was more favorable than that of HLA-B27(-)B51(+) Behçet uveitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that HLA-B27(+)B51(+) Behçet uveitis is a benign subgroup of Behçet uveitis. The positivity of HLA-B27 may be a good prognostic factor in Behçet uveitis.
