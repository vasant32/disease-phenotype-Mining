A 12-year-old boy presented with a limp and findings suggesting localised myositis of his right calf and a working diagnosis of Behçet disease was made. During 3 years of follow-up, he had another three episodes of calf myositis, all responsive to corticosteroids within days. CONCLUSION: A case of recurrent localised myositis as a main manifestation of Behçet disease is reported. The evolution of incomplete Behçet disease, which is common in children, to the full blown form, with the emphasis on muscle involvement and the importance of early diagnosis of Behçet disease, is discussed.
