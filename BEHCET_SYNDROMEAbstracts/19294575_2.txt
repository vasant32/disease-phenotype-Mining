 PURPOSE: To report the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab injection in treatment of macular edema in a case of optic disc vasculitis. Design: Retrospective case review. METHODS: A patient diagnosed with macular edema due to optic disc vasculitis was treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injection. RESULTS: One week after injection, fundus appearance dramatically improved and macular edema regressed. The patient was followed up for 1 year after injection and there was no recurrence of macular edema. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that intravitreal bevacizumab treatment might be effective in the management of macular edema in patients with optic disc vasculitis.
