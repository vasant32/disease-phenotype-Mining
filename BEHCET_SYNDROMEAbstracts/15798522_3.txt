INTRODUCTION: The involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Behçet's disease is very rare. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 47-year-old man with a six-year history of Behçet's disease and a two-year history of peripheral nervous system involvement. This patient presented with paraesthesia and weakness of the upper and lower limbs, diarrhea and erectile dysfunction. The electromyogram showed evidence of an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy and the nerve biopsy showed an axonal neuropathy. Routine blood tests were normal, there was no increase of serum creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransfease or lactate dehydrogenase and no signs of hyperthyroidism. Fibroscopy and colonoscopy showed no signs of entero-Behçet. The patient was treated with prednisone, cyclophosphamide and carbamazepine with an improvement of paraesthesia. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of the peripheral neuropathy in Behçet's disease is still unknown, it might be due to vasculitis of the vasa nervorum or to the side effects of colchicine. Our report is particular by the association of sensorimotor and autonomic involvement of peripheral neuropathy in a patient with Behçet's disease.
