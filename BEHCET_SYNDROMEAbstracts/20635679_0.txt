BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine if the Behcet's disease poses a risk for a lower bone mineral density (BMD), and the relation to cytokines. Behcet's disease is a complex, multisystemic, chronic inflammatory disorder. METHODS: This study was carried out on 60 patients and 24 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Serum osteocalcin (OK) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), which are bone formation markers and urine deoxipyridinolin (DOP) levels that is bone resorption marker were evaluated in patient and controls groups. Serum IL-1 and TNF-alpha levels were measured in both groups. BMD was measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the lumbar spine and left femur. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in OK and DOP levels between BD and control groups. BALP levels were significantly higher in BD than control groups (p = 0.002). Although there were no statistically significant differences in IL-1 levels between BD and control groups, TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in BD than control groups. There were significant differences in BMD values of lumbar spine (p < 0.05). No significant differences in BMD values of the left femur were detected in the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Behcet's disease can be a risk for osteoporosis especially in the lumbar spine. We determined a negative correlation between IL-1 and femur neck BMD (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 23).
