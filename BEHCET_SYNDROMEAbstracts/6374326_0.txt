Two females patients suffering from Beh√ßet syndrome were treated by manual plasmapheresis. A total of eight (8) sessions were performed in both patients. In each session, about 800 cm.3 of blood were depurated , without plasmatic replacement. In no case other therapeutic methods were used neither during nor after plasmapheresis. There was a rapid improvement of all clinical manifestations, which became particularly evident after the 3.rd session. Lesions were completely healed in both patients by the end of treatment. Laboratory data became normal or nearly normal, namely: fibrinogen, syderemia and plasma fibrinolytic activity. In the two years follow-up, patients have been well and free of symptoms with the exception of some episodic crisis of little oral aphtae of short duration.
