Since prolactin (PRL) has been implicated as playing a role in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases and since Behcet's Syndrome (BS) is a unique systemic vasculitis, we investigated serum PRL levels in patients with BS. We found that mean PRL levels in patients with clinically active BS, were not significantly higher than patients with clinically inactive BS and healthy controls. This finding may be regarded as evidence that a contribution of hyperprolactinemia to the aetiopathogenesis of BS seems unlikely.
