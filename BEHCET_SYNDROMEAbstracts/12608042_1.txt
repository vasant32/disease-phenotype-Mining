The etiology of Behcet's disease (BD) has not been accurately specified until now, however, it is a fact of general knowledge that the genetic factors and environment have an effect on the pathogenesis of the disease. 21 histological antigens (HLA) were typed for 30 Caucasians with BD (14 of them had retinal vasculities, and 16 of them were without it). HLA A and HLA B were determined by using the standard lymphocyte microcytotoxicity technique. The disease was diagnosed in accordance with the criteria of the International Study Group for BD. 1000 healthy donors of the Middle European population were in the control group. The frequency of occurrence of HLA B-5 was reliably higher in patients with retinal vasculitis (85.7%, PR = 5.53) and without retinal vasculitis (68.8%, PR = 4.44) as compared to the controls (15.5%, p < 0.0000). The occlusive retinal vasculitis was found only in BD patients with HLA B-5 (p = 0.0242). The study shows that HLA B-5 is associated with BD and can be a marker of severe retinal vasculitis.
