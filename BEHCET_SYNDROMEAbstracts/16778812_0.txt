Yanagihori et al. found an HLA-independent higher frequency of IL-12B promoter polymorphism in Adamantiades-Beh√ßet's disease (ABD) patients than in controls. Stimulation with streptococcal antigens specifically increased expression of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells IL-12 p40/p70. The authors provide evidence for an antibacterial host response toward T-helper type 1 immunity mediated by IL-12 in patients with ABD, which is HLA independent.
