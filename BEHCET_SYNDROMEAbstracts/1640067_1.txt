Aphthosis in Behçet's disease is usually located in the oro-genital areas, but other locations have been described. The authors report the case of a 45 year old woman who presented with an ocular conjunctival aphthous ulcer. This was the initial presentation of Behçet's disease. This case report illustrates that aphthosis in Behçet's disease can have unusual sites such as the ocular conjunctiva. Furthermore, in this case, the conjunctival aphthosis was presenting sign of this systemic disease.
