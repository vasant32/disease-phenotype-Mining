 OBJECTIVES: To measure the levels of interleukin (IL)-27, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-17 in serum and supernatants of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with Behçet's disease (BD) compared with healthy subjects, and to evaluate the effect of recombinant human IL-27 (rhIL-27) on IFN-γ and IL-17 production by PBMCs. METHODS: Forty-three patients with BD and 40 healthy controls were included in this study. The serum levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 and their production by PBMCs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with the effects of levels of rhIL-27 on IFN-γ and IL-17 production by PBMCs. RESULTS: There were significantly higher levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 in sera of patients with BD compared with the controls. Levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 in BD patients with active uveitis were significantly higher than in those without. Moreover, IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 production by stimulated PBMCs was increased in BD patients compared to controls. In the presence of rhIL-27, stimulation of PBMCs from BD patients resulted in decreased production of IL-17 but increased production of IFN-γ. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 play a role in the pathogenesis of BD.
