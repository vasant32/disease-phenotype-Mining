We report a patient with Behcet's disease (BD) who went into remission after administration of oral contraceptives. About 2 years after the diagnosis of BD, she developed dysfunctional uterine bleeding with menometrorrhagia, during which oral and genital ulcers and erythema nodosum-like lesions persisted without remission. The oral contraceptive that was prescribed to control her irregular menstruation also suppressed outbreaks of ulcers and erythema nodosum-like lesions. This case suggests that sex hormones might be considered as one of the aggravating or inducing factors in BD.
