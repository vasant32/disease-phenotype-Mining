22 patients suffering from Birdshot retinochoroidopathy (10), idiopathic vasculitis (6) and Behcet disease (6) and treated by cyclosporine were tested at regular intervals during 11 to 38 months by the lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) and basophil degranulation test (HBDT) with S retinal antigen. These two tests were found frequently positive especially during acute inflammation for the LST. However HBDT was positive in all the patients before relapse of acute inflammation which is in favor of its predictive value and its involvement in the triggering of inflammation at the basophiles or at the local mast cell level.
