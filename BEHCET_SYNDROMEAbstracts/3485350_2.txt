This is the first study in children of the use of the peroral pneumocolon, which entails insufflation of air per rectum to examine the terminal ileum and cecum in conjunction with a conventional barium follow-through examination. Of 1188 conventional barium follow-through examinations performed during 2 1/2 years, results were ambiguous in 13 patients, who then underwent a peroral pneumocolon study. This study showed terminal ileitis in six patients, confirming the diagnosis of Crohn disease in five and Beh√ßet syndrome in the other. In four patients peroral pneumocolon findings were normal. More extensive cecal or proximal ileal disease was shown in three patients by peroral pneumocolon, and fistulae suspected on conventional study were confidently excluded in two others. In all 13 the examination was well tolerated, and avoided further, more invasive procedures. The peroral pneumocolon is a useful procedure in children for these indications.
