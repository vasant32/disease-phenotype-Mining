OBJECTIVE: This study examined the interobserver and intra-observer reliability of the Turkish version of the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF), which was obtained by a translation and back-translation process. METHODS: Fifty Behçet's syndrome (BS) patients were assessed by four rheumatologists in separate morning and afternoon sessions. RESULTS: The results showed good intra- and interobserver agreement for the oro-genital ulcers and eye involvement of BS, but there was poor agreement between (kappa score = 0.14) and within observers (range for kappa scores 0.09-0.25) for their overall impression of disease activity. Individual low kappa scores were also noted for erythema nodosum, vascular involvement, central nervous system involvement and gastrointestinal involvement. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the Turkish version of BDCAF may be useful for assessing the classic triad of BS (oro-genital ulceration and eye involvement), but more experience is needed for its other parts.
