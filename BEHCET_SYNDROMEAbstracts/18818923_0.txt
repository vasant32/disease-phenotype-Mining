We described a pilot study using Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) aiming the assessment of small bowel in Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Ten patients with BD and abdominal complaints underwent VCE with Given Pillcam SB (Given Imaging Ltd., Yoqneam). VCE revealed small bowel lesions in all ten subjects. Five patients had active symptoms of BD while five others had clinically inactive disease. Jejune was the most frequently affected GI segment being involved in eight cases, four from each group. We suggest that small bowel involvement may be frequent in BD patients, even in the absence of oral ulcerations.
