BACKGROUND: Because there is an increased inflammatory response to trauma, particularly of the skin, in patients with BehÃ§et's syndrome (BS), an alteration in wound healing in BS is expected. The aim of this study was to investigate the healing features of punch biopsy wounds in BS and acne vulgaris (AV) patients used as controls. METHOD: Full-thickness skin punch biopsies (4 mm) were taken from the hairless sites of the non-dominant forearms in 20 BS and 20 AV patients. Each patient was examined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10, and the biopsy wound area and induration were marked on sterile glass slides. Other inflammatory changes, such as suppuration and pain, were also recorded. No antiseptic solutions or ointment, except saline, were used. RESULTS: The wound area healed similarly in both groups (p > 0.05). Thirteen (65%) BS patients had erythematous haloes around the wound on the first day. The number of patients presenting inflammatory changes reached 18 (90%) on the second day in the BS group. The area of erythema around the wound in BS patients was significantly greater than that in AV patients (5; 25%). It gradually decreased day by day. Purulent changes were observed in four BS patients on day 1, and induration around the biopsy wound in six patients on day 2. Only one patient with AV had suppuration, which appeared on the second day, while no AV patient displayed induration. CONCLUSION: Biopsy-induced trauma may cause increased inflammation in BS, but wound healing is not altered.
