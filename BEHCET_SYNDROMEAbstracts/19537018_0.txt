 BACKGROUND: Amyloidosis in Behçet's disease is rare and has a poor outcome. AIM: Report a new case. CASE: We report a case of a 38-year-old Tunisian woman who presented with Behçet's disease and nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy showed amyloid deposition consistent with AA type. She had not any associated disease that might be an additional cause of secondary amyloidosis. She was treated by colchicine. After 3 years, proteinuria had disappeared and persisted negative 11 years after the diagnosis. A second renal biopsy showed the persistence of amyloidosis. CONCLUSION: As amyloidosis is one of the prognostic factors affecting survival in Behçet's disease, patients with this disease should be screened for amyloidosis. Administration of colchicine to these patients may be beneficial.
