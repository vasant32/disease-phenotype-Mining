 OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the role of CX3CL1 in patients with active and inactive Behçet's Disease (BD), Neuro-Behçet's Disease (NBD) and control subjects. METHODS: Fifty-six patients admitted to the BD and NBD Outpatient Clinics, and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Serum CX3CL1 levels were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the serum CX3CL1 levels of control subjects, and patients with active and inactive BD or NBD, regardless of treatment. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing CX3CL1 levels in patients with BD and NBD. Our results demonstrated that serum CX3CL1 levels were not changed in active and inactive BD and NBD. However, further large-scale studies are needed to confirm our results.
