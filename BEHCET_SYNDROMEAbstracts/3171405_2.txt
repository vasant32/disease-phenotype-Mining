The frequency of thrombotic episodes in patients with Behçet's disease prompted us to study their hemostasis. Seventy patients were investigated and 27 of them (38%) had history of venous thrombosis; they were compared to 27 healthy subjects and to 16 hospitalized patients in whom the diagnosis of Behçet disease was ruled out. Fibrinolytic activity after a 10 minute venous occlusion was significantly decreased while fibrinogen, factor VIII and von Willebrand factor was increased as well as the tPA inhibitor (PAI-I): the last 3 proteins are synthetized by the endothelial cell. No significant difference was observed between patients with or without history of thrombosis. Coagulation and fibrinolysis changes observed are not specific of Behçet disease since they were also found in a population of patients without Behçet disease and without history of thrombosis.
