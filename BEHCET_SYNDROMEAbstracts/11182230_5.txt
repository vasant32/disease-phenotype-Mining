Beh√ßet's disease (BD) has been established to be associated with HLA-B51. However, it has not been revealed whether the HLA-B51 gene itself or another gene located near the HLA-B gene is directly involved in the pathogenesis of BD. Previously, using Japanese BD patients, our group has narrowed down a BD-causative gene to 46 kb between the MICA and HLA-B genes by means of fine mapping analysis with eight microsatellite markers distributed within a 1100 kb segment around the HLA-B gene. To know whether this mapping result is generally observed in BD of another population we have investigated repeat polymorphisms of the same microsatellite markers in Jordanian BD patients. Furthermore, we have evaluated these data by Mantel-Haenzel stratified analysis to find out a primarily associated locus for BD. As a result, HLA-B51 was found to be the most strongly and primarily associated marker. This result suggests that the pathogenic gene of BD is HLA-B51 itself, but unlikely to be other genes located in the vicinity of HLA-B.
