The clinical signs, laboratory data, and histological features of recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) and Behçet's syndrome suggest a viral etiology. In fact, there are reports of adenovirus isolations in herpetiform oral ulcers and on the isolation of a filterable agent in sporadic cases of Behçet's syndrome. However, isolation studies on the major and minor aphthous ulcers and more recent studies on Behçet's syndrome have been negative. A review of the literature on the role of viruses and autoimmunity in RAU and Behçet's syndrome is presented. Biopsy specimens of ulcerative lesions were grown in vitro for up to 300 days. Those cultures, along with leukocytes and body fluids, were examined by a variety of techniques for the presence of virus or viral antigens. Although a persistent or latent virus was not detected, these negative studies cannot exclude a viral etiology. In fact, the hypothesis of an infectious and viral etiology is still reasonable.
