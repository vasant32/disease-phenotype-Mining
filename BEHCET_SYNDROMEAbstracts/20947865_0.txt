Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic disorder characterized by endothelial dysfunction. However, the relationship between oxidative stress and endothelial function has not been clearly shown. We investigated the relationship between oxidative stress markers and endothelial function in patients with BD. Patients with BD (n = 40) having active disease and sex- and age-matched 40 controls were included. Endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) technique. Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein levels (hsCRP) were measured in all participants. Brachial artery FMD was significantly lower in patients with BD than in controls. Gamma-glutamyltransferase and hsCRP levels were higher in patients with BD than in controls. Also, GGT and hsCRP levels were inversely correlated with endothelial function. Oxidative stress markers are elevated in patients with BD having active disease. This may be one of the reasons behind the vasculitis in active BD.
