OBJECTIVE: To study clinical features, visual prognosis and response to immunosuppressive drugs in patients with ocular Beh√ßet Disease (BD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: clinical data of 17 patients (33 eyes) were retrospectively reviewed from May 1996 to May 2003. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 12/5. The commonest manifestations were oral ulceration (100%) and skin lesions (88%). Anterior uveitis was present in 59%, posterior uveitis was in 76% and panuveitis was in 88.1%. Visual acuity improved in 11 (33.3%) eyes, remind stable in 18 (54.5%) eyes and four (12.1%) eyes lost two or more lines. Main drug therapy consisted of colchicine and cyclosporine (59%). Seven patients had received three drugs simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: BD can lead to an irreversible visual loss; however, the visual prognosis is good (85%) if immunosuppressor treatment is implemented.
