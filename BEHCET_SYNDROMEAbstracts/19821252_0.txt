Beh√ßet disease (BD) is a chronic multisystemic inflammatory disorder, mainly characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, and uveitis. Large vein thrombosis in BD is unusual; when present, it is most frequently seen in the inferior or superior vena cava (SVC). The authors describe an unusual hepatic pseudolesion caused by abnormal focal enhancement through collateral pathways to the liver in two BD patients with SVC occlusion on three-dimensional multi-detector computed tomography, using volume rendering and maximum intensity projection techniques. BD should be suspected in patients presenting a focal increased hepatic enhancement area with collaterals caused by occlusion of the SVC without evidence of a hypercoagulable state or malignant mediastinal or thoracic venous inlet obstruction.
