 PURPOSE: To report a case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis after placement of a fluocinolone acetonide (Retisert) implant. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: A 65-year-old man with a history of Adamantiades-Behcet disease and bilateral recurrent uveitis that was unresponsive to systemic corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy developed clinical evidence of CMV retinitis after receiving his second intravitreal Retisert implant in the left eye, while on no systemic immunosuppression. He did not develop CMV retinitis in the right eye despite multiple intraocular and periocular steroid injections. The patient responded well to intravitreal foscarnet followed by placement of an intravitreal ganciclovir implant. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists should be aware of the potential risk for development of CMV retinitis after local ocular immunosuppressive therapy.
