 PURPOSE: To assess the etiologies and outcome of liver granulomatosis. METHODS: We analyzed all consecutive liver granulomatosis diagnosed in our internal medicine department from 2000 to 2008. RESULTS: Among 471 liver biopsies, 21 disclosed evidence of liver granulomatosis (4.5%), in sixteen women (76%) and five men, with a median age of 41years. Thirteen were caucasians (62%). At the time of diagnosis, six (28.5%) had isolated abnormal liver function tests, and fifteen (71.4%) presented with clinical manifestations. The underlying cause was identified in 18 cases (85.7%). Eleven (52.3%) were systemic diseases: five (23.8%) primary biliary cirrhosis, two (9.5%) primary sclerosing cholangitis, two (9.5%) common variable immunodeficiency, one (4.7%) Sjögren's syndrome, and one (4.7%) Behçet's disease. Two (9.5%) patients had sarcoidosis. Three (14.3%) liver granulomatosis were of infectious origin (tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and hepatitis C virus), two (9.5%) were neoplastic (Hodgkin's lymphoma and liver cell adenoma), and three (14.3%) were idiopathic. With a median of 38 months of follow-up, four patients (19%, two common variable immunodeficiency and two sarcoidosis) developed portal hypertension, independently of cirrhosis. One patient died of cryptococcosis. CONCLUSION: In accordance with other European studies, systemic diseases are the main causes of hepatic granulomas. Liver granulomatosis related to common variable immunodeficiency and sarcoidosis are at risk of portal hypertension.
