Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multi-systemic vasculitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between Rho-kinase (ROCK2) gene polymorphisms and patients with BD in a Turkish population. A total of 194 BD patients and 276 healthy controls with similar age and sex were included to this study. Polymorphisms were analyzed in genomic DNA using a BioMark 96.96 dynamic array system. mRNA from blood samples was extracted, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for ROCK2 gene expression. There were marked changes in both genotype (TT, 41.8%; TA, 30.3%) and allele (T, 57%; A, 43%) frequencies for the rs35768389 (Asp601Val) polymorphism in patients compared with controls (TT, 64.6%; TA, 9.4%, P < 0.0001; T, 69.3%; A, 30.7%, P = 0.0004). Although CC genotype (52.0%) of rs1515219 polymorphism were more frequent, CT genotype (27.7%) were less frequent among the patients than controls (CC, 31.7%, CT, 44.6%, P = 0.0001). There was an increase in C allele (65.8% vs 54.0%) and decrease in T allele frequencies (34.2% vs 46.0%, P = 0.001) in patients. However, no associations were found with rs726843, rs2290156, rs965665, rs10178332, rs2230774, rs6755196, rs10929732, and rs34945852 polymorphisms. There was an increase in peripheral blood mRNA ROCK2 expressions in patients. This is the first study to examine the involvement of ROCK2 gene variation in the risk of incident BD. The results strongly suggest that ROCK2 gene polymorphisms may modify individual susceptibility to BD in the Turkish population.
