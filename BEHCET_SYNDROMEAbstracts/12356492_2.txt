In this study, Doppler signals recorded from ophthalmic artery of 86 patients were processed by personal computer using fast Fourier transform, Burg autoregressive (AR), and least-squares AR methods. By using these spectrum analysis techniques, the variations in the shape of the Doppler spectrums as a function of time were presented in the form of sonograms in order to obtain medical information. These sonograms were then used to compare the applied methods in terms of their frequency resolution and the effects in determination of Behcet disease.
