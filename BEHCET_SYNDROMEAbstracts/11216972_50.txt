OBJECTIVES: We sought to test the hypothesis that vascular endothelial function is impaired in Behçet's syndrome and reflects increased levels of oxidative stress. BACKGROUND: Behçet's syndrome is a multisystem inflammatory disorder commonly complicated by vascular thrombosis and arterial aneurysm formation. The precise mechanisms underlying vascular disease in Behçet's syndrome are not known. METHODS: We studied 19 patients with Behçet's syndrome (18 to 50 years old, 9 men) and 21 healthy volunteers (18 to 50 years old, 10 men). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (endothelium-dependent), and nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced dilation (endothelium-independent) were measured. To investigate oxidative stress mechanisms, vascular studies were repeated 1 h after administration of vitamin C (1 g, intravenous) in 12 patients and 12 control subjects. RESULTS: Flow-mediated dilation was reduced in patients with Behcet's syndrome as compared with control subjects (0.7 +/- 0.9% vs. 5.7 +/- 0.9%, p = 0.001). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the brachial artery diameter (4.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.2 mm, p = 0.47) or NTG-induced dilation (19.7 +/- 1.9% vs. 19.7 +/- 1.2%, p = 0.98). In regression analysis, Behçet's syndrome was associated with impaired flow-mediated dilation independent of age, gender, brachial artery diameter, blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose. Vitamin C increased flow-mediated dilation in Behçet's syndrome (0.2 +/- 0.7% to 3.5 +/- 1.0%, p = 0.002), but not in control subjects (4.3 +/- 0.6% to 4.7 +/- 0.4%, p = 0.51). In both groups, NTG-induced dilation and brachial artery diameter were unchanged after vitamin C treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular endothelial function is impaired in Behcet's syndrome and can be rapidly improved by vitamin C treatment. Our results support a role for oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of Behçet's syndrome and provide a rationale for therapeutic studies aimed at reducing vascular complications in this disorder.
