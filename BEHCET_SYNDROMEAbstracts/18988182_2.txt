PURPOSE: A rare case of unilateral retinal detachment due to a macular hole in a patient with Behçet disease is presented. METHODS: Interventional case report. RESULTS: A 31-year-old man with a 6-year history of Behçet disease presented with a relapse in his disease and received infliximab. Ten days later, as the inflammation subsided, a retinal detachment caused by a macular hole was diagnosed. The patient underwent vitrectomy surgery with internal limiting membrane peeling and silicone oil tamponade. Seven months after the removal of the silicone oil, the macular hole remained closed and the retina attached. Optical coherence tomography was performed before surgery and during the postoperative follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Behçet disease could be rarely associated with retinal detachment caused by a macular hole. Macular traction caused by severe recurrent vitritis in combination with the retinochoroidal atrophy due to the relapsing retinitis might be the underlying mechanism of this complication, which to the authors' knowledge has never been reported before.
