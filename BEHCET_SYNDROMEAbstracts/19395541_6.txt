 OBJECTIVES: HLA-B51 is strongly associated with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) in any ethnic background. We recently reported that another gene, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) is also implicated in BD in a Japanese population. To confirm these results, we investigated polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene in Korean patients with BD. METHODS: In this study, 119 patients with BD and 141 healthy controls were enrolled; every participant was a Korean. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms previously detected in TLR4 by direct sequencing were analysed for an association with BD. RESULTS: The most frequent haplotype, TAGCGGTAA, was significantly increased in HLA-B*51-positive BD patients (49.5%), compared with healthy control participants [32.3%; P = 0.029; odds ratio (OR) = 2.01; 95% CI 1.25-3.23]. This haplotype was also significantly increased in BD patients with arthritis (48.2%; P = 0.003; OR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.26-3.26). There were no significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of patients and controls for each single nucleotide polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: The haplotype of TLR4 may increase the risk for developing BD and the complication of arthritis in the Korean population.
