PURPOSE: To report the response of acute Behçet retinitis to high-dose corticosteroids. METHOD: Case report. A 58-year-old man with Behçet disease and severe bilateral glaucoma experienced a sudden decrease of visual acuity to counting fingers in his (better-seeing) left eye. Examination disclosed hypopyon uveitis and an infiltrative retinitis threatening the fovea. He received intravenous methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, 1 gram per hour on each of 3 successive days, followed by oral prednisone and cyclosporine. RESULTS: The retinal infiltrate disappeared within 24 hours. Visual acuity improved to LE, 20/400 by day 5 and returned to LE, 20/30 after 3 months. A visual field demonstrated a scotoma corresponding to the location of the previous retinitis. CONCLUSION: High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone can reverse severe vision loss in acute Behçet retinitis.
