Selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase [SOD] and glutathione peroxidase [GSH-Px]) levels in sera were detected in Behçet patients. Age and sex matched controls were used to find out if oxidative stress takes place in the etiopathogenesis of Behçet's disease. Superoxide dismutase levels were found to be lower in the whole patients group when compared to controls. In whole patients and inactive patients' group Zn and Se levels were found to be higher, but not different in the active patients group when compared to controls. No significant difference was found between the groups as Cu and glutathione peroxidase levels were taken into consideration. According to the results of the present study, SOD level is low in Behçet's disease patients' sera independent from the phase of the disease, and as a result of decreased SOD activity, increased production of free oxygen radicals may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease.
