The humoral and cellular immune status, the cutaneous pathergy, PMNL in vitro function tests as well as clinical and general laboratory examination were performed and evaluated on ten patients suffering from Behcet's disease (BD) and ten other patients with benign recurrent aphthosis (RA). The same set of in vitro tests (except PMNL exposure to solutions of copper sulfate or DDT) was carried out on a control group consisting of more than 100 healthy male and female individuals of various ages. Apart from general signs of inflammatory activity (leukocytosis, elevation of ESR, increased IgG serum levels), cutaneous pathergy to mild local highly injuries and marked enhancement of PMNL chemotaxis proved to be highly significant symptoms in acute phases of BD in contrast to benign RA. Both symptoms, in particular the hyperchemotaxis of PMNL, can be regarded as valuable diagnostic means in the early detection of beginning or atypical BD.
