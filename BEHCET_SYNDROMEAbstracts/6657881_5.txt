The psychiatric investigation of 55 Beh√ßet patients through a psychoanalytically oriented interview and the application of the Rorschach test revealed that psychosocial stress factors were predominant prior to the onset of the disease. The personality structures, according to the Rorschach findings, were generally pathological with a weak ego, regressive tendencies, disturbed body image, high anxiety, difficulties in social adaptation and evaluation of realities as well as incapacity of an adequate expression and handling of affects and emotions. The stressful life events, as well as disturbed personality structures seen in these patients are common to most psychosomatic manifestations. Considering the recent research emphasizing the effects of immune mechanisms in the etiology of this disease, together with the relationship of autonomic system functions with immune reactions as also with psychological stress situations, it is discussed whether psychosocial stress and weak personality structures can be assumed to be one of the possible effective factors in the etiopathogenesis of this disease, at least as precipitating agents.
