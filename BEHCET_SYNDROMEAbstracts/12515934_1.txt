INTRODUCTION: Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitis which rarely occurs in childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcome of Behçet's disease in Moroccan children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 13 cases of children, 10 males and 3 females with Behçet's disease followed up between 1990 and 1998. The diagnosis of Behçet's disease was based on the criteria of the international study group for Behçet's disease. All patients were studied by a complete clinical, ophthalmological and laboratory staging and treated with appropriate therapy. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis of Behçet's disease was 13.9 years. Familial forms were found in 30.7% of cases. Oral aphtae were noted in all cases while genital ulcers were present in 76% of cases. Cutaneous lesions were found in only 1 case and 53.8% of children had a pathergy test. Articular involvement was found in 30.7%, neurological features in 46% and vascular manifestations in 38.4%. Only one case of intestinal involvement was noted. Ocular features (76%) were bilateral in all cases and were dominated by panuveitis complicated by macular edema ant retinal vasculitis. CONCLUSION: Behçet's disease seems to have particular characteristics in childhood. Familial forms, articular and digestive manifestations appear to be more frequent in early stages of Behçet's disease in children. Neurological and vascular involvement with panuveitis seems more frequent in the older children.
