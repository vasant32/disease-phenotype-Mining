Behcet's disease is a rare multisystemic chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by a classic triad of urogenital ulcerations, chronic eye inflammation, and skin lesions. We report on a case of a spontaneous pseudoaneurysm of the superficial femoral artery caused by Behcet's disease that was treated with an endovascular stent-graft followed by percutaneous drainage. We emphasize the use of percutaneous drainage of the pseudoaneurysm to decrease compression on the stent-graft and native vessel.
