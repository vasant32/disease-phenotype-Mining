A 31-year-old man, suffering from Behçet disease, was admitted to our hospital because of a palpable mass in the right hypochondrium. On testing, laboratory data showed an abnormal liver function, positive HBs antigens, and a high AFP level. An abdominal CT and a SCAG revealed large tumors in the liver. The patient died of hepatic failure 6 months after the first admission and an autopsy was performed. At autopsy, hepatocellular carcinomas were found to occupy most of the entire liver. Histologically, the residual liver showed no remarkable changes, such as liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. To date, few cases of Behçet disease complicating a malignant neoplasma have been reported. The possible relationship between Behçet disease and the occurrence of malignant tumors is described with a review of the literature.
