Behçet's syndrome is a rare inflammatory, multisystemic disease of unknown etiology and chronic relapsing course, manifested chiefly by ocular and mucocutaneous lesions. Among its neurologic complications, a cerebral vasculitis can occasionally been observed, upon which there is little information at present. A 31-year-old man presented with fever, weight loss, oral and genital ulcers, blurred vision and memory loss during the last two months. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 170 lymphocytes/microliters. Computed Tomography and cerebral angiography were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed small hyperintense lesions in the corticomedullary and periventricular regions. The patient's condition improved with corticosteroids. We stress upon the importance of MRI to detect small-vessel vasculitis in Behçet's disease.
