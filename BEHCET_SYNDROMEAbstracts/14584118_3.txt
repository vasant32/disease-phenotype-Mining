A recurrent aneurysm at the anastomosis site or the remaining artery frequently occurs after the operative treatment of an aneurysm in Behçet's disease despite anti-inflammatory medication. Herein, a ruptured left renal artery stump aneurysm in a patient with Behçet's disease, who received a left nephrectomy, aorto-biiliac bypass and heterotopic autotransplantation of the right kidney for the treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal hypertension one year prior to this admission, is reported. An aneurysm and rupture occurred despite the administration of anti-inflammatory medications while monitoring of the clinical findings, such as skin manifestations, erythrocyte segmentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Although there is no definite proven treatment modality to prevent recurrent aneurysms at the anastomosis site or a remote artery, close follow-up with anti-inflammatory medications, and surveillance with regular intervals are the only current methods for the prevention and/or to treatment of an arterial complication in patients with Behçet's disease.
