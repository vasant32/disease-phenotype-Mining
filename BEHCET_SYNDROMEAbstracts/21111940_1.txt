 BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical characteristics and evolution of a series of adult patients hospitalized for neuro-Behçet disease (NBD). METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted for NBD in a teaching hospital were retrospectively selected. Disability at discharge and during follow-up was graded with the modified Rankin Scale, and outcome classified as good or poor (grades 3-6). RESULTS: Twenty patients were included (M/F, 13/7). Mean age at NBD diagnosis was 36.3 years. Nineteen patients had other manifestations of Behçet disease (BD) before NBD developed, but only 7 met the complete diagnostic criteria for BD. Fever, headache, motor weakness, and cranial nerve palsy were each present in approximately 60% of patients. There was a low prevalence of behavioral changes (5%), seizures (5%), and sphincter incontinence (0%), and a relatively high prevalence of meningism (25%). Non-neurologic manifestations of BD were concurrently detected in 15 patients (75%). 80% had parenchymal involvement. Brain biopsies during 5 attacks showed perivascular lymphocytic infiltration with reactive astrocytosis, but no frank vasculitis. During a mean follow-up of 6.3 years per patient, 12 had at least one relapse. In total, there were 22 relapses; all but two were in the same location and were symptomatically similar in each patient. At the end of follow-up, 7 patients (35%) had a poor outcome, including 4 who died. CONCLUSION: Recording of previous manifestations of BD and a physical examination to detect concomitant systemic manifestations of BD may help establish an early diagnosis of NBD. Relapses frequently occurred in the same location. No frank vasculitis was present in brain biopsies.
