This article presents the scientific and social work of Benedikt Adamandiadis and the history of the "Adamandiadis-Beh√ßet syndrome". The authors also attempt to describe the inestimable contribution to modern Greek ophthalmology. It is not the authors' intention to underscore Adamandiadis' importance as the discoverer of the syndrome - for him, the fulfillment of his duties as a scientist and a human being was always more important than personal fame -, but merely to correct an historical injustice.
