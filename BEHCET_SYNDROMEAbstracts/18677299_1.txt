Vascular Behcet's disease has a poor prognosis. This poor prognosis is due to postoperative complications including pseudoaneurysm with 50% occurrence after previous surgical repair of aneurysm especially at the site of surgery. It is suggested that the fragility of the vascular wall may play a major role in this recurrence. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of endovascular stent-grafting for recurrent aortic aneurysm in patients with Behcet's disease. We present a recurrent aneurysm of the abdominal aorta at a previously scarred operative site in a known case of Behcet's disease. We attempted an endovascular treatment.
