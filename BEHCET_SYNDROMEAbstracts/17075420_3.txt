 OBJECTIVE: The present study prospectively investigated the frequencies and characteristics of audio-vestibular disturbance and the results of audiologic and vestibular function tests in patients with Behçet's disease. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. METHODS: Seventeen patients with Behçet's disease (mean age 41.2 [30-56] years, 5 males and 12 females), as well as age- and sex-matched healthy controls, were included in this study. All subjects satisfied the diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet's Disease. Information on the subjects was obtained through questionnaires. Tests, including those for hearing impairment, tinnitus, ear fullness, and dizziness, pure-tone audiometry, and vestibular function, were performed. RESULTS: Auditory symptoms were reported by 7 (41.2%) and dizziness by 14 (82.4%) of the subjects. Sensorineural hearing loss was present in four (23.5%) subjects. One was treated with a cochlear implantation because of bilateral sudden deafness. Spontaneous nystagmus was detected in two (11.8%) subjects. Abnormal findings were noted in 1 (5.9%) in saccadic movement, 5 (29.4%) in the bithermal caloric tests, and 10 (58.9%) in the rotation chair tests. In total, audiologic or vestibular disturbance were noted in 16 (94.1%) of the subjects. However, audio-vestibular abnormalities were not noted in the healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Audio-vestibular disturbance is not rare in Behçet's disease patients compared with healthy controls. We believe that audio-vestibular assessment and management may be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with Behçet's disease.
