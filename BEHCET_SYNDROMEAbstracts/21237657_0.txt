A 21-year-old male presented with severe throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting and progressive visual loss. Clinical examination revealed bilateral papilledema and left abducens nerve palsy. MRI showed findings consistent with dural sinus thrombosis. Combinging the clinical findings, MRI and a positive pathergy test, the patient was diagnosed with dural sinus thrombosis associated with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Despite acetazolamide, prednisone, azathioprine and repeated lumbar punctures, his signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension gradually worsened. Therefore, lumboperitoneal shunting was planned after which rapid resolution of intracranial hypertension was observed. After reviewing similar reports, we suggest that lumboperitoneal shunt placement can be an effective treatment for patients with BD with medically refractory intracranial hypertension associated with dural sinus thrombosis.
