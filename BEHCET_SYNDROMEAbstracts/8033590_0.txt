Intracellular binding proteins have been identified and isolated from B cells by their ability to bind to the synthetic peptide (1169-1191), the major immunodominant epitope of bovine interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) coupled to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B. After SDS-PAGE, two discrete protein bands of approximately 72 and 74 kDa, were found to be present in B cells of naive Lewis rats as well as in EBV transformed B cells from a human patient with ocular Beh√ßet's disease. Enhanced expression of these peptide-binding proteins was achieved by incubating the cells with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from S. typhimurium. The approximately 72 and 74 kDa peptide-binding proteins reacted in western blot with monoclonal antibodies specific for both constitutively expressed and inducible 72/74 kDa hsp 70 proteins. The demonstration that these proteins bind to the immunodominant epitope of IRBP indicates that they may play a role in the processing and presentation of antigens by antigen-presenting cell (APC).
