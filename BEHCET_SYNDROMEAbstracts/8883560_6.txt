This study was performed in order to evaluate the age, sex, geographical distribution, ocular involvement, age of onset, and attacks in Behçet's disease. We examined 540 Behçet patients between 1973-1993. Of the patients, 453 were male and 87 female (m/f: 5.2/1). The average age was 30.7 +/- 0.35. The disease mostly appeared in the third decade and it was statistically significant that sex affected the age at onset of the initial symptoms. The onset of symptoms was more frequent among males in the 25-29-year age group, and among females below 19 and above 35 years of age. The duration of the disease was 28.7 +/- 3.1 months. The state of ocular attacks were evaluated in 598 eyes of 303 patients who were followed regularly during the first year. The risk and frequency of attacks were greater in the eyes with poorer visual acuity, and in such eyes, the number of attacks was greater < or = 24 while smaller > or = 35 years of age.
