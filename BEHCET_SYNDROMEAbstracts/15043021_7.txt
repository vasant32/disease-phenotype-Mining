Behçet's disease is a multisystemic chronic autoimmune process that can be responsible for some vascular lesions, in addition to its typical dermatologic lesions. Arterial pseudoaneurysm formation can be diagnosed in this group of patients and generally surgery is indicated. In this report, we discuss an alternative endovascular intervention and its advantages. An endovascular stent graft was placed in the popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm of a 37-year-old male with Behçet's disease. Early results of this procedure are good thus far. Implantation of an endovascular stent graft, an alternative modality in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms, can result in a shorter hospital stay and a significantly shorter period before returning to normal life. General anesthesia and surgical dissection are avoided, thus diminishing morbidity.
