We reported a case of a 45-year-old woman with encapsulated necrosis associated with Behçet's syndrome. The lesions were characterized by multiple, small subcutaneous nodules on the extremities. Histologically, a nodule consisted of degenerative adipocytes encapsulated by fibrous tissue. A membranocystic lesion was also observed in the cavity of the nodule. The patient had a long-term history of Behçet's syndrome and suffered from erythematous subcutaneous nodules, resembling erythema nodosum on the extremities with a tendency to recurrence. These observations indicate that Behçet's syndrome could be implicated in the development of encapsulated necrosis as an underlying disease.
