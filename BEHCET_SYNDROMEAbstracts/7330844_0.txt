The immunoglobulin class of circulating immune complexes (IC) was examined in 35 patients with Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS) according to the HLA phenotype of these patients. Cold precipitable complexes were separated and assayed by laser nephelometry and polyethylene glycol precipitable complexes were assayed by rocker immuno-electrophoresis for IgG, IgA and C3. The results suggest that in patients with BS, HLA-B12 is associated with an increased proportion of IgG and a decreased proportion of IgA and C3 in their immune complexes, whilst the converse was found with HLA-B5 or DRw2. The ratio of IgA:IgG in immune complexes was therefore low in patients with HLA-B12 but high in those with HLA-B5 or DRw2. We suggest that a linkage may exist between HLA and gene(s) determining the immunoglobulin class, in response to antigenic stimulation or the site of antigen localization.
