It has been postulated that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 is associated with Behçet's disease. In previous study, we induced Behçet's disease-like symptoms in ICR mice inoculated with herpes simplex virus. In this study, several inbred mouse strains -- B10.BR (H-2k), B10.RIII (H-2r), C57BL/6 (H-2b), C3H/He (H-2k), Balb/c (H-2d) -- which had different types of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), were inoculated with herpes simplex virus type 1 (KOS strain) in order to demonstrate the role of histocompatibility antigen in the development of Behçet's disease-like symptoms. Behçet's disease-like symptoms developed in 40-50% of B10.BR, B10.RIII and C57BL/6 strains, but in only 2% of C3H/He and Balb/c. B10.BR and C3H/He strains had a common haplotype (H-2k) but the rate of manifestation was different. So, we conclude that MHC is not directly correlated with development of Behçet's disease-like symptoms in the animal model of herpes simplex virus induced Behçet's disease-like symptoms.
