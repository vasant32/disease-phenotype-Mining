Since aneurysms in patients with Behçet's disease are often pseudoaneurysmal and adjacent arteries are highly inflammatory, there is not only a risk of rupture but also a high incidence of late surgical complications at anastomotic sites. Furthermore, there is no consensus on perioperative medical therapeutic strategy in patients with active vasculo-Behçet's disease who require surgery. Herein, we present two cases of active Behçet's disease, a 51-year-old male with rupture of the left internal iliac artery who required emergent operation and a 31-year-old male with a rapidly developed pseudoaneurysm in the right superficial femoral artery. Surgical and perioperative therapeutic strategies are also discussed.
