Demodex folliculorum is an obligate parasite and commonly detected in patients with immune system deprivation. This study is planned to document the Demodex folliculorum prevalence among patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). The patients who referred to the ophthalmology clinic were included in the study. Fourty patients with BD and 131 patients with refractive errors without any ocular and systemic disease were included. For parasite detection, 3 eyelashes from each inferior eyelid were epilated. Standardized skin surface biopsy (SSSB) was performed for detection of parasite at cheeks of patients. Samples were prepared with Hoyer's solution and investigated under the light microscope. There were 15 female and 25 male in BD group and 61 female and 70 male patients ine control group. Mean ages were 37.62 and 38.38 for BD and control groups, respectively. Demodex folliculorum prevalence at eyelashes was 65% for BD and 10% for control group. SSSB of cheek revealed 7.5% positivity for BD and 10% for control group patients. Statistical analysis documented a significant difference for eyelashes (p < 0.05) which could not be detected for skin results. Investigation of Demodex folliculorum in BD may be useful, even in patients without any complaint, for the treatment of ocular and eyelid discomforts of these patients.
