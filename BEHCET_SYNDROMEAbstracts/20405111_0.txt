 PURPOSE: The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 metabolizes several important drugs, such as warfarin and oral antidiabetic drugs. The enzyme is polymorphic, and all known alleles, for example, CYP2C9*2 and*3, give decreased activity. Ultra-high activity of the enzyme has not yet been reported. METHODS: We present a patient with Beh√ßet's disease who required treatment with high doses of phenytoin. When fluconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, was added to the treatment regimen, the patient developed ataxia, tremor, fatigue, slurred speech and somnolence, indicating phenytoin intoxication. On suspicion of ultra-high activity of CYP2C9, a phenotyping test for CYP2C9 with losartan was performed. RESULTS: The patient was shown to have a higher activity of CYP2C9 than any of the 190 healthy Swedish Caucasians used as controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of an ultrarapid metabolism of losartan and phenytoin may apply to other CYP2C9 substrates, where inhibition of CYP2C9 may cause severe adverse drug reactions.
