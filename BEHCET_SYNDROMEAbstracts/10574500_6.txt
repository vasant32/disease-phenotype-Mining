To report retinal tears formation in 3 eyes of 2 patients with active panuveitis and Behçet's disease. We describe 2 patients that were diagnosed and treated for Behçet's disease with active panuveitis. Retinal tears developed while the inflammation was active. The patients were treated with topical, oral steroids, and cyclosporine therapy for bilateral panuveitis. One patient presented with a retinal tear located at the periphery of the active retinal lesion. The other had multiple tears associated with active retinal lesions in both eyes. Argon laser photocoagulation was performed in both patients as soon as the tears were detected. Ocular inflammation was controlled with this therapy, and only a few mild flare-ups occurred. The patients have been followed up for 8 and 16 months, respectively. During this period no new retinal tears have developed. Although retinal tear formation is rarely associated with Behçet's panuveitis, the clinician should be aware of this as a possible complication. When structural changes are present in the vitreous, detailed ophthalmoscopy is indicated to assess for retinal tears. If a tear is detected in a patient with panuveitis and Behçet's disease, laser photocoagulation therapy should be performed immediately to prevent retinal detachment.
