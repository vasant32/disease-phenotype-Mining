The prevelance of ankylosing spondylitis or sacroiliitis in Behcet's disease has been the subject of debate for some time. Two cases with atypical presentation and course are discussed. The first patient was a young woman with Behcet's disease whose primary complaint was neck pain. X-ray examination showed severe cervical involvement, characteristic of the type seen in women with ankylosing spondylitis. She subsequently developed anterior uveitis. The second patient was a man suffering from back pain and limited movement of his neck and back. When he was referred to our outpatient clinic, his severe anemia became the subject of the whole investigation. He was diagnosed with Behcet's disease with ankylosing spondylitis accompanied with amyloidosis and an end-stage renal failure.
