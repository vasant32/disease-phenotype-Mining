Vascular involvement in Behçet's disease has been reported in 7-40% of patients in the literature and nearly 8% of these will have serious vascular complications during follow-up. So far, little information is available on the extent of vascular involvement in patients with Behçet's disease who are free of vascular symptoms. The study comprised 34 individuals with Behçet's disease who were free of vascular symptoms and 47 healthy volunteers. Both groups underwent non-invasive peripheral vascular examination consisting of Doppler, photoplethysmography, and segmental pressure measurements and determination of ankle-brachial pressure and femoro-brachial pressure indices. Venous insufficiency was detected in 22 of 68 lower extremities examined in the Behçet's disease group and in ten of 94 in the controls (P < 0.001). The number of extremities with an ankle-brachial pressure index of less than 1.00 for both the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, was significantly higher in the Behçet's disease group (P < 0.001). The femoro-brachial pressure index was significantly higher in the controls than in the Behçet's disease group (1.32 versus 1.23 for the right leg, P < 0.05; 1.31 versus 1.22 for the left leg, P < 0.03). Vascular symptom-free patients with Behçet's disease seem to have a high incidence of peripheral vascular involvement compared with healthy controls.
