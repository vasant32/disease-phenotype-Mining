OBJECTIVE: To determine Th1/Th2 cell response cytokine production profile in Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: Interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-12 (Th1 cell response), and IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 (Th2 cell response) cytokine production from anti-CD3/anti-CD40 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: PBMC from patients with BD produced higher levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 (Th2 cell response), almost normal levels of IL-2 (Th1 cell response), but highly deficient IFN-gamma and IL-12 (Th1 cell response). The additions of exogenous recombinant IFN-gamma to the anti-CD3 stimulated PBMC dramatically changed this pattern with enhanced IL-12 and concomitantly decreased IL-4 and IL-10 production. CONCLUSION: The immune system in BD may be characterized by a divergent cytokine production profile of mixed Th1/Th2 (Th0) cell type; IFN-gamma is critical in modulating the IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 cytokine network pathway in this disease.
