Neurological involvement occurs in 5.3% to 30% of patients with Beh√ßet's disease. Neurological manifestations can be secondary to direct central nervous system involvement (encephalitis, encephalomyelitis) or vascular angeitis (essentially cerebral venous, thrombosis and, rarely, intracranial aneurysms). Neurological pseudotumoral presentation is rarely reported. We report a case of 26-year-old woman suffering from left hemiplegia. MRI was performed and showed pseudotumoral lesion in the protuberance and the right cerebral pedicule. Oral and genital aphtous ulcers were found. HLAB51 was positive. The patient improved with steroid therapy.
