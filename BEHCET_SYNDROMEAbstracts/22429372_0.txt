 OBJECTIVE: The global function of both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functions were compared in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) versus healthy controls. METHODS: Biventricular function was evaluated by measurement of the myocardial performance index (MPI)  evaluated from tissue Doppler echocardiographic measurements in 24 BD patients and was compared with measurements in 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Significantly higher MPI values were associated with ventricular dysfunction. The study demonstrated impaired RV function  in patients with BD compared with healthy controls, whereas normal LV function was observed both in patients with BD and in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Early noninvasive evaluation of the properties of BD during the asymptomatic phase of this inflammatory disease may have prognostic value  in the management of patients.
