Non-phagocytic beta-glucuronidase release from neutrophils obtained from patients with Behçet's disease was assessed using chemotactic peptide as an enzyme inducer. Neutrophils from the patients with active Behçet's disease released much more beta-glucuronidase than neutrophils from the patients with inactive Behçet's disease or from normal healthy people. Beta-glucuronidase release was parallel to the activity of the disease and can be used as an indicator for the activity of Behçet's disease.
