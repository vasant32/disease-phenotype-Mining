PURPOSE: To report macular ischaemia and visual loss in patients with panuveitis due to Behçet's disease. METHODS: We describe macular ischaemia, a rare finding, in 3 eyes of 3 patients with panuveitis who were diagnosed and treated as having Behçet's disease. The patients underwent fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) using a digital imaging system and were treated with topical and oral steroids and cyclosporine in 2 cases, and with added azathioprine in the third case. RESULTS: The 3 eyes showed macular ischaemia associated with peripheral retinal vasculitis on FFA and control of inflammation was achieved in all cases. After an average of 2 years follow-up, visual acuity and macular ischaemia improved in 2 eyes, while no recovery was seen in the third. CONCLUSION: The presence of macular ischaemia on FFA in Behçet's disease is a predictor of poor visual outcome. Macular ischaemia may show partial recovery with the treatment of the disease.
