This paper presents a short review of some inflammatory diseases which involve both the nervous system and the uvea, and of some forms of uveitis whose onset could be neurogenic. Multiple sclerosis and reticulum cell sarcoma are examples of systemic neurologic diseases which can be accompanied by uveitis or pseudo-uveitis. Syndromes such as Beh√ßet's or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada are characterized not only by a highly severe panuveitis but also by the participation of optic nerve, meningeal, and brain tissues in the inflammatory process. The occurrence of sympathetic ophthalmia and herpetic uveitis could to a certain extent be due to a neurogenic transmission of the antigen. For Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis, however, the old theory of sympathetic nerve dysfunction at its origin is no longer widely accepted.
