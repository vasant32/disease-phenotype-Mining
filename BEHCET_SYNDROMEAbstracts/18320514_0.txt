PURPOSE: Cataract surgery in exudative uveitis is often followed by severe complications (pupillary seclusion/occlusion, dense posterior capsule/anterior vitreous opacification, cystoid macular edema following repeat YAG laser procedures) which often drastically limit functional recovery. Total removal of cataract, anterior vitrectomy, and scleral fixation of a posterior chamber (PC) intraocular lens (IOL) has been tried as a surgical alternative, searching for lessened postsurgical complications and a better outcome. METHODS: Group A was a cohort of 12 patients with cataract after exudative (mostly sarcoidosis and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada) uveitis, subjected to intracapsular cataract extraction, anterior vitrectomy, and scleral fixation of PC IOLs. Group B was the control group, including 12 patients with a similar clinical condition subjected to phacoemulsification or extracapsular cataract extraction plus in the- bag or in-the-sulcus IOL implantation. Follow-up time for both groups was at least 7 years. RESULTS: Postoperative inflammatory signs were substantially less in Group A patients, from 2 days up to >7 years postsurgery. Group A patients showed no cells/exudates adhering to the IOL surfaces, no synechiae, minimal (as compared to Group B) vitreous opacifications, and significantly higher visual acuity (p=0.024 at the seventh year control). Group A patients reported less frequent relapses of uveitis postsurgery, but the relevant clinical data did not allow statistical evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Total removal of cataract in highly exudative uveitic eyes, plus anterior vitrectomy and scleral fixation of PC IOLs, although technically a more demanding surgical procedure, proved to be safe and more effective than classical procedures.
