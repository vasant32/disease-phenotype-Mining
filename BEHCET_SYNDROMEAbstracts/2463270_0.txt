Protein HC and protein HC-IgA complex were measured in 18 different types of fluid sample from healthy subjects and patients with different illnesses to determine if the concentrations of protein HC and protein HC-IgA complexes could be used to monitor certain diseases, when measured separately. The normal values for HC ranged from between 0.30 mg/l in saliva and 11.7 mg/l in blood plasma. HC-IgA complex has a greater range, from undetectable concentrations (urine, colostrum, and cervical mucus) up to 59.2 mg/l in blood plasma. Undetectable concentrations of HC-IgA complex were also shown in serum from patients with IgA immune deficiency and in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis. Increased concentrations of HC were noted in bronchoalveolar fluid from a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, serum from patients with Behcet's syndrome, and in synovial fluid from patients with gout, chondrocalcinosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. On the other hand, the concentrations of HC-IgA complex were raised only in those patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis or rheumatoid arthritis.
