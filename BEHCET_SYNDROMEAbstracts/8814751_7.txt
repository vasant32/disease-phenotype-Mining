AIMS: To investigate the lack of equilibrium in the regulatory mechanism of the immune system in Beh√ßet's disease (BD), the expression of Fas antigen, an apoptosis related antigen, on peripheral blood lymphocytes from BD patients was analysed. METHODS: Twenty one BD patients were the subjects in this study. Ten healthy adults were examined as controls. Cell surface antigens of lymphocytes were analysed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: There was a significant (p < 0.01) difference in the proportion of CD4 positive cells with CD25 between BD patients with active uveoretinitis (27.6% (SD 8.4%)) and the controls (14.7% (2.3%)), but no significant difference in the proportion of CD4 or CD45RO positive cells with Fas. On the other hand, the proportion of CD8 positive cells with Fas was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in BD patients with active uveoretinitis (45.6% (11.6%)) than in those with inactive uveoretinitis (23.8% (8.1%)) or in the controls (24.4% (2.5%)). The proportion of CD19 positive cells with Fas was also significantly (p < 0.01) higher in BD patients with active uveoretinitis (13.0% (5.0%)) than in the controls (5.1% (2.1%)). CONCLUSION: The insufficient expression of Fas on activated CD4 positive T cells and its high expression on CD8 positive T cells seem to play an important role in the chronic inflammation in BD.
