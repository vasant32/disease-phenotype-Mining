The authors report a patient who developed a meningo-myelitis attributed to Behçet disease. Spinal MRI assessed spinal involvement. Among neurological manifestations of Behçet disease, isolated spinal cord involvement is infrequent. Dramatic improvement of neurological symptoms was obtained after steroid and immunosuppressive treatment.
