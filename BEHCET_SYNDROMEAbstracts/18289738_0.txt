 PURPOSE: Our aim is to describe the skeletal manifestations of Behcet's disease (BD) among young adults in a military population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 176 patients with BD who were followed between 1980 and 2005. All the patients fulfilled the international study group on Behcet's disease diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Rheumatic manifestations were noticed in 79 out of 176 patients (45%), ranking second after the skin and mucosal manifestations of the disease. Articular manifestations were the first disease manifestation in 16.5% of the patients. Inflammatory arthralgias were the most common manifestation and observed in 81%, interesting mainly the large lower limb joints. Disease course was acute in most of the patients. Arthritis was less common: oligoarthritis (7.5%), monoarthritis (6.5%) and polyarthritis (5%). Axial involvement was also noted: spine pain in 29%, isolated sacroiliitis in 7.5%, and definite ankylosing spondylitis in 5%. CONCLUSION: Joint involvement is common in BD and could be the first manifestation of the disease. Most of the patients present with inflammatory arthralgias of the large lower limb joints. Disease course is usually favourable, spontaneously or with treatment. However, in our study population, skeletal manifestations were responsible for significant disability.
