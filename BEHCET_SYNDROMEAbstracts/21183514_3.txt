 AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of infliximab treatment in patients with refractory uveoretinitis associated with Behçet's disease. METHODS: Clinical records of 14 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients received infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter. The main outcome measures were frequency of clinically observable ocular inflammatory attacks, background retinal and disc vascular leakage as assessed by fluorescein angiography during periods of clinical quiescence, visual acuity and adverse effects. RESULTS: The median follow-up after initiating infliximab therapy was 19 months (range 12-29 months). At 12 months, eight of 14 patients (57%) had experienced no inflammatory attacks, and the frequency of attacks was significantly reduced when compared with the 6-month period just prior to infliximab use. Background retinal and disc vascular leakage assessed at 12 months improved in 11 of 14 patients (79%). Visual acuity improved or remained unchanged at 12 months in 26 of 28 eyes (93%). Infliximab therapy was terminated in two patients owing to infusion reactions. However, no serious adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Infliximab over the first year of treatment appeared effective in reducing ocular inflammatory attacks, as well as background retinal and disc vascular leakage, in patients with refractory uveoretinitis associated with Behçet's disease.
