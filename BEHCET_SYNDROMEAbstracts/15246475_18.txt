This pictorial essay illustrates the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on various vasculitis or vasculopathies, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Beh√ßet's disease, Churg-Strauss disease, primary angitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), giant cell arteritis, infectious vasculitis, sickle cell disease, drug-induced vasculopathy and hypertensive vasculopathy. DWI proves to detect small and active ischemic changes not visible on conventional MRI, and it clearly discriminates cytotoxic from vasogenic edema in patients with cerebral vasculitis or vasculopathy. DWI seems useful in assessing the treatment and patient outcome.
