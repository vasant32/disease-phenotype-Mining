OBJECTIVES: Aortic regurgitation associated with Behçet's disease is rare, and prosthetic valve detachment after aortic valve replacement is one of the most serious complications reported. We have investigated the surgical results of valved conduit operation in 8 patients. METHODS: Between 1987 and April 1999, 8 patients underwent surgery. There were 7 males and 1 female, and their ages ranged from 33 to 60 years (mean, 48 +/- 10 years). The valved conduit procedure was a modified Bentall operation. RESULTS: One patient died of arrhythmia during the hospital stay. The follow-up period in the other 7 patients ranged from 1 to 138 months after surgery (mean, 74 months). None of these 7 patients died during the follow-up period. Valve detachment needing redo-operation occurred in 1 patient, and he underwent a valved conduit operation again. CONCLUSIONS: Valved conduit reconstruction is indicated in patients with aortic regurgitation caused by Behçet's disease, in whom prevention of valve detachment is difficult even by current valve fixation methods.
