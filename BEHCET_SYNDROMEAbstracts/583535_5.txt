Combined CRAO/CRVO in our patients occurred with rapid visual loss, usually over a few hours, associated with evidence of inflammation and/or cellular infiltration of the retrobulbar portion of the optic nerve. The ophthalmoscopic appearance was characteristic, with papilledema and hemorrhages of various types in the posterior pole. The retina also showed ischemic changes, with a milky-white color and cherry-red macula. Fluorescein angiography, when possible, showed no retinal vascular flow, and normal choroidal flow. After six to eight weeks, optic atrophy was evident and the retinal vessels were markedly narrowed or obliterated. The macula showed typical cystic changes. Neovascularization often developed, leading to neovascular glaucoma as the end result.
