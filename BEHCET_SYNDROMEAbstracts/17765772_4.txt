 OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of hearing loss in Behçet syndrome. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This study included 27 patients with Behçet syndrome and 35 sex-and age-matched controls. A complete audiological evaluation was performed. RESULTS: The average pure-tone audiograms from both groups showed a statistically significant hearing loss in the Behçet group. Sixteen patients (59.26%) showed some degrees of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), with the high-frequency type (4, 8, 10, and 12 kHz) being the most common pattern (93.75%). Hearing loss was the fourth most common manifestation. Although the patient's age, sex, and the duration of the disease were not related to hearing loss, there was a significant correlation between a negative pathergy test and hearing loss in patients with Behçet syndrome. CONCLUSION: We should consider audiovestibular involvement in Behçet syndrome as a common finding.
