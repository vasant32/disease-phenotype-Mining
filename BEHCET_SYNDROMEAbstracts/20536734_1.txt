To promote an understanding of autoimmunity in BD, we surveyed autoAgs in patients with BD and investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of the identified autoAbs. Specifically, proteins, extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and separated by 2DE, were subjected to WB, using five serum samples from patients with BD. The detected candidate autoAgs were identified by mass spectrometry. As a result, 17 autoantigenic spots were detected by the 2DE-WB, out of which eight spots were identified. They are enolase-1, cofilin-1, vimentin, Rho-GDI beta protein, tubulin-like protein, and actin-like proteins. The autoAbs to one of the identified proteins, cofilin-1, were investigated by WB using a recombinant protein in 30 patients with BD, 35 patients with RA, 32 patients with SLE, and 16 patients with PM/DM. The autoAbs to cofilin-1 were detected by WB in four (13.3%) of the 30 patients with BD, five (14.3%) of the 35 patients with RA, two (6.3%) of the 32 patients with SLE, and eight (24.2%) of the 33 patients with PM/DM. Our data indicate that the generation of autoAbs to cofilin-1 may reflect common immunological disorders in BD, RA, and PM/DM. Our data would help understanding of the immunopathology of BD. In addition, the proteomic approach would be a useful way to investigate autoAgs.
