Intestinal ulcers in Behçet's disease (BD) tend to cause perforation with significant morbidity. The optimal surgical procedure in such cases is controversial and the postoperative period can be eventful with an unpredictable course. We report three cases of perforations with varying locations in three patients with long-standing Behçet's disease. Two patients required two and one patient required four operations. It is emphasized that the clinician must be alert in a patient with BD when abdominal symptoms accompany the clinical picture. As soon as the diagnosis is reached, surgical intervention with limited resection must be performed. Endoscopic examination and careful medication play major roles in the follow-up.
