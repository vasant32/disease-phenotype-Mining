Esophageal involvement in Behcet's disease is very uncommon, only 21 cases have previously been reported. We have observed five cases with this disease, and investigated the clinical, morphological, and histological aspects of these cases. Esophageal lesions in Behcet's disease occurred more frequently in male patients with the incomplete type. Laboratory data revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a strongly positive C-reactive protein. The middle portion of the esophagus was most commonly involved. There were several morphological forms of esophageal lesions including erosions, perforated ulcers, widely spreading esophagitis, and severe stenosis. Therefore, there was no unique form to the esophageal lesions in contrast to the ileocolonic ulcers in intestinal Behcet's disease. Histological examination revealed lymphocytic or neutrophilic infiltration in ulcerative lesions. Vasculitis was rarely observed.
