Vascular involvement in Behçet's disease has a wide range of clinical manifestations, the most common being thrombophlebitis and arterial aneurysms. Every major vessel may be involved, but aneurysms of the carotid artery are relatively rare in adults and even rarer in children. We describe here a case of a 13-year-old boy with Behçet's disease with a recurrent carotid artery aneurysm treated with arterial ligation and immunosuppressive therapy who later developed an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the absence of other indications of disease activity. This case underscores the need for continuous monitoring of patients with vascular manifestations of Behçet's disease.
