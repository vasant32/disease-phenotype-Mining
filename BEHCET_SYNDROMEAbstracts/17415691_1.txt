PURPOSE: To report the outcome of Nd:YAG laser iridotomy in the management of secondary glaucoma associated with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: In this prospective study, Nd:YAG laser iridotomy was performed on eyes with secondary angle-closure and pupillary block glaucoma associated with BD. The pretreatment and post-treatment intraocular pressures (IOP) and the number of antiglaucoma medications were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The study consisted of 16 eyes of 11 patients (2 female, 9 male, mean age 39.2+/-8.9 years). Post-treatment follow-up ranged from 6 to 36 months (mean 13.8+/-8.9). The mean IOP was 21.6+/-2.5 mmHg on 2.5+/-0.6 medications before iridotomy. IOP reduced to 17.7+/-2.5 mmHg on 1+/-0.6 medications at the first month and 17.1+/-3.2 mmHg on 1.7+/-0.9 medications at the sixth month of treatment. The differences between IOP and number of antiglaucoma medications at baseline and at the sixth month of the treatment was statistically significant (p<0.00001). For four eyes trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and for one eye Ahmed valve implantation were performed in the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Nd:YAG laser iridotomy can provide reduction of IOP and the number of antiglaucoma medications in selected cases with secondary glaucoma associated with Behcet's disease.
