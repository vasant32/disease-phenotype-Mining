Central nervous system involvement is a rare and serious complication of Behçet's disease (BD). Herein, we describe a patient with an atypical central lesion, who experienced progressive hypesthesia of the right arm and sensory loss of the trigeminal nerve together with intense headache. A repeated biopsy was necessary to conclusively establish the diagnosis of BD. Therapy with infusions of infliximab led to a remarkable full remission. TNFα-blocking therapy was successfully replaced by azathioprine. The present well-illustrated case demonstrates the difficulty of establishing the diagnosis of BD with central nervous system involvement, the dramatic benefit of short given TNF-α-blocking agent, and the long-term remission with azathioprin.
