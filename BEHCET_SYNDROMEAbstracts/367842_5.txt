Current concepts incriminate a cell-mediated mechanism in the pathogenesis of mucocutaneous lesions of Behçet's disease. However, such a mechanism alone fails to explain various aspects of hyperreactivity response which is a unique feature manifested with lesions similar to those occurring spontaneously in the disease. 19 patients with active Behçet's disease have been investigated for possible mechanisms other than cell mediated which may be involved in the process. Beside cell-mediated mechanisms there were indications that polymorphonuclear leucocytes and mast cells may play part in the process. Further study of these two aspects may open a new approach in the understanding and possibly in the treatment of this disease.
