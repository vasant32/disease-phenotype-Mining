Vascular manifestations of Behçet's disease include venous and arterial occlusions, arterial aneurysm and pseudo-aneurysm formation. The main problem of the surgical treatment of vascular lesions in Behçet's disease is the high incidence of complications such as recurrent aneurysms, thrombosis and fistulization to the adjacent organs. Here we present a case of Behçet's disease with multiple complications after aortic reconstructive surgery, including perigraft infection, abscess distal to the graft, occlusion of arteries of the lower extremities, aortoenteric fistula and distal anastomotic site aneurysm rupture.
