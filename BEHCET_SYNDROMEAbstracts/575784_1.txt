Report on a 42 year old patient from the Mediterranean area suffering from recurrent iridocyclitis for 2 years, accompanied by aphthous changes of the buccal mucosa and genitalia. Behcet's disease was suspected, and the patient was treated for ten days with i.v.-infusions of 200 mg Endoxan and 50 mg Prednisolon. After appearance of a leutic maculo-papulous rash systemic application of Penicillin lead to a quick cessation of the cutaneous efflorescences as well as of the uveitis. This case shows that luetic etiology of ocular inflammations is by no means beyond actuality.
