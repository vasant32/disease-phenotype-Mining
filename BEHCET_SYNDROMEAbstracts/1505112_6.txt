We report a 52-year-old male Caucasian who presented with a peripheral erosive arthritis, then pyoderma gangrenosum, and six years later pancolitis and orogenital ulcers. The case illustrates an overlap that may exist between Beh√ßet's syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In either condition seronegative erosive peripheral joint disease is an uncommon presenting feature.
