A 37-year-old Turkish patient suffered from recurrent oral aphthosis, genital ulcers, skin lesions and inflammatory eye disease. Because of typical history, physical findings and absence of laboratory abnormalities Morbus Behçet was diagnosed. Under treatment with prednisone and azathioprine his symptoms disappeared and there was no recurrence of Behçet disease for three months.
