We describe a patient with Beh√ßet's disease who developed multiple aneurysms and retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to rupture of a renal artery aneurysm. Despite successful transcatheter arterial embolization, the patient died due to pneumonia. Our retrospective review of the case revealed that the CT scan obtained 3 months before the rupture had demonstrated dilatation of bilateral renal arteries.
