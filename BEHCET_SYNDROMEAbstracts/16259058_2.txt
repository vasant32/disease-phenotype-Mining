Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, multisystem disorder, characterized by recurrent oral ulcer, genital ulcers, eye lesion, and skin lesion. The underlying pathology is nonspecific vasculitis of all vessel sizes, and severe vasculitis can result in fistula formation of neighboring tissues due to a necrotic process. Herein, eleven cases of BD combined with fistula are presented. In the present study, various types of fistula were associated; enterocutaneous fistula in six patients, and rectovaginal fistula in two. The other three patients showed aortoduodenal fistula, urethrovaginal fistula and urethrocutaneous fistula. They were treated with a corrective operation, but the prognoses were poor due to frequent relapses.
