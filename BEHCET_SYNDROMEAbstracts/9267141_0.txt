The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brain perfusion of neuro-Behçet disease using 99mTc-HMPAO. In total, nine patients (7 men and 2 women) were evaluated. Seven were in the chronic phase, one was acute and the other was subacute. The results of perfusion study were compared with the MRI findings. The findings of chronic-phase neuro-Behçet disease were as follows: 99mTc-HMPAO showed hypoperfusion of the cerebellum in 3, brain stem in 5, and cerebral cortex in 4 patients. Moreover, asymmetry of the basal ganglia and thalamus was seen in 4 cases with 99mTc-HMPAO. MRI showed atrophy of the cerebellum in 4, brain stem in 5 and cerebral cortex in 2 patients. One acute patient showed a perfusion defect with 99mTc-HMPAO that was consistent with the vasculitis shown with MRI. In the remaining subacute patient, perfusion defect was demonstrated with 99mTc-HMPAO, consistent with the infarction shown with MRI. It is concluded that brain perfusion scintigraphy is useful to evaluate the brain blood flow of neuro-Behçet disease.
