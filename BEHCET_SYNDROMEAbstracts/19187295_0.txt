 BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-8 has been shown to correlate with the activity of Beh√ßet's disease (BD). The aim of this study was to develop tools as reliable as IL-8 levels in defining BD severity. METHODS: In total, 32 patients with BD and 16 healthy controls were included in the study. Medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory investigations and measurement of serum IL-8 levels were performed. The patients were classified as groups I and II based on the serum IL-8 levels. The patients were then reassigned to groups based on the predictions through discriminating analysis. RESULTS: In addition to the differences between patient and control groups, the differences between groups I and II, group I and controls, and group II and controls were statistically significant. The discriminating analysis results showed that the patients had been assigned to groups I and II with 100% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Discriminating analysis using clinical and routine laboratory findings indicated that 100% of the patients were accurately assigned to the same groups as their IL-8 levels indicated. This suggests that the classification made according to discriminating analysis using these routine variables is a reliable method in determination of the disease severity.
