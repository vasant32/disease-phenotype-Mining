 PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in patients with cystoid macular edema (CME) associated with Behçet disease. DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: Ten eyes of 10 patients with CME from Behçet disease made up the study population. All eyes had persistent CME despite medical treatment for at least 2 months. Intravitreal injection of 4 mg (0.1 ml) of triamcinolone acetonide was offered to treat macular edema. The visual and anatomic responses were observed. RESULTS: At 1-month follow-up, a reduction in mean foveal thickness of 37.4%, from 416 microm to 260.5 microm, was attained. At 3-month follow-up, mean foveal thickness was 286.2 microm and at 6 months, 263.7 microm. No eyes had lost vision at 1 month, and eight eyes (80%) showed improvement in visual acuity. At 3-month and 6-month follow-up, three eyes (30%) remained stable and the other eyes had maintained the improved acuity. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide is a promising therapeutic method for CME from Behçet disease.
