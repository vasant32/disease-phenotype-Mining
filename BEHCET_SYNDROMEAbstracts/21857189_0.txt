A 40-year-old man presented with painless sudden visual loss due to a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) in his right eye. Three months later, he had painless acute visual loss in his left eye with visual acuity of 20/100 and a swollen optic disc. After oral prednisone treatment, the disc swelling resolved and acuity recovered to 20/20. Five months later, the patient experienced another episode of vision loss in the left eye associated with optic disc edema. With steroid therapy, he regained 20/20 acuity once again. With a history of recurrent oral ulcers, fluorescein angiography showing obliterative retinal vasculitis in the right eye, and steroid responsive optic neuropathy in the left eye, we made the diagnosis of incomplete Beh√ßet disease.
