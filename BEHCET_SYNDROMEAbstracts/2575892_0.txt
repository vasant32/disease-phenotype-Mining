In this study the activity of a membrane-bound enzyme, gamma-glutamyl transferase GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase - GGTP), was investigated in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with Behçet's disease. Lymphocyte GGT activity in Behçet's disease was found to be significantly lower than that of control lymphocytes (p less than 0.01). This altered activity may be due to the abnormality in the membrane of lymphocytes of Behçet's disease patients.
