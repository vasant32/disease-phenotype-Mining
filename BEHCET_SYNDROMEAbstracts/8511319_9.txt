To clarify the characteristic radiographic findings and serial radiographic changes in nonsurgical cases of intestinal Beh√ßet disease (BD), seven patients were followed up for an average of 4 1/2 years (range, 8 months to 11 years 4 months). They underwent repeated examination with barium meal studies and double-contrast barium enema meal studies and double-contrast barium enema radiography. Initial radiography revealed one to three deep ulcers in the terminal ileum or ileocecal region in five patients. The ulcers healed while patients were treated with medical therapy but recurred during the follow-up period. In four of these five patients, follow-up radiography demonstrated various changes within each case: At each examination, an enlarged ulcer or a newly developed ulcer was often found in conjunction with a healed ulcer. In the other two patients, multiple shallow ulcers or innumerable aphthoid ulcers were seen throughout the entire colon, and these ulcers showed a good response to medical treatment. These results indicate that serial radiographic changes in patients with intestinal BD may mimic those in patients with Crohn disease, with findings in the terminal ileum and colon that wax and wane with medical treatment.
