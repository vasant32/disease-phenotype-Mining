Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a form of systemic vasculitis with the classic triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcers along with uveitis. In BD, muscular involvement is very rare. We report a case of muscular involvement in BD with characteristic findings using ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
