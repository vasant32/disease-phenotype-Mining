We report a case involving bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy with Behçet's disease in a 49-year-old woman. The patient presented because of abrupt visual disturbances. An ophthalmic examination, including fluorescein angiography, visual field testing, and visual-evoked potentials, was performed. Her visual acuity was 20/100 bilaterally and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy was suspected. She was treated with systemic methylprednisolone; however, disc pallor developed and the visual acuity remained 20/200 bilaterally. Optic neuropathy can be bilateral, affect both eyes simultaneously, and lead to severe visual loss despite high doses of systemic steroid treatment. Optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease is very rare. This case provides clinical insight into the neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of Behçet's disease.
