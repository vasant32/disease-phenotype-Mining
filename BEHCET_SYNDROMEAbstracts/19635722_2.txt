 AIM: To assess basic thrombophilic parameters in both active and inactive periods of the ocular Beh√ßet disease (BD) with posterior segment involvement in comparison with those in healthy adults as controls. METHOD: Thirty patients within the active period of the ocular BD with posterior segment involvement, 30 patients within the inactive period of the ocular BD with posterior segment involvement and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Plasma protein C, free protein S, antithrombin III and activated protein C resistance were measured in the studied groups. RESULTS: Activated protein C resistance and antithrombin III levels were significantly altered in both active and inactive ocular BD patients when compared with those in the controls (p<0.05), whereas protein C and free protein S levels were not significantly changed within both groups (p>0.05). There was no difference among the active and inactive groups of BD for all of the studied blood tests (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Activated protein C resistance together with increased antithrombin III plasma levels are associated with the posterior segment involvement in ocular BD based on the assessment of basic thrombophilic tests.
