Synovial tissue obtained from 7 patients with Behçet's syndrome and 7 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis could not be distinguished under ordinary light microscopy when examined blind. A wide spectrum of features was seen in both diseases, and it is suggested that these may reflect severity and duration as much as the nature of the arthritis. Electron microscopy also failed to illustrate any distinct features of Behçet's syndrome, but immunofluorescent studies indicated consistent deposition of IgG.
