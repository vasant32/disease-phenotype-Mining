Of 32 patients with Behçet's disease, 21 had uveitis. The uveitis was seldom the initial manifestation of systemic disease, but once established, it tended to become chronic and bilateral, involving the anterior and posterior segments. Hypopyon was a relatively uncommon occurrence in this series. All patients with uveal inflammation had obvious cellular reactions within the vitreous body. Other posterior segment manifestations of the disease included localized retinal edema, macular edema, disc edema, retinal pigmentary changes, and accumulation of exudative material in the deep retina. One patient developed a necrotizing retinitis with deep retinal exudation and subsequent retinal detachment. Occlusions of retinal vessels were common. Neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of Behçet's disease included cranial nerve palsies, a homonymous hemianopic field defect, and papillitis.
