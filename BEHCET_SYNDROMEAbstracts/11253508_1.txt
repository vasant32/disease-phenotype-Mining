We report the case of a 39-year-old German women who suffered from chronic inflammatory bowel disease which had not been exactly classified for 6 years. In the course of the disease she developed recurrent iritis, nodular skleritis, oral and genital ulcer, erythema nodosum and axillary folliculitis. For the first time retrosternal pain occurred. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed mid esophageal ulcer formation. Colonoscopy demonstrated ulcerative colitis with no involvement of rectal mucosa. Histologically a cutaneous vasculitis in the lower limb was seen and diagnosis of Adamantiades-Beh√ßet disease with marked gastrointestinal involvement and rare manifestation in the esophagus was established. A therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine and mesalazine was started. Under this regimen stomatitis, esophagitis and cutaneous vasculitis resolved, while the colitis showed partial remission now for up to one year.
