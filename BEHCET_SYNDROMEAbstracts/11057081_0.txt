Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic multisystem vasculitis, affecting many organs and the vascular system, of unknown aetiology. Eyes, skin, joints, the oral cavity, the central nervous system, and, less frequently, heart, lung, kidney, the genital system and the gastrointestinal tract can be involved. Intrathoracic manifestations of BD consist mainly of thromboembolism of the superior vena cava and/or other mediastinal veins; aneurysms of the aorta and pulmonary arteries; pulmonary infarct and haemorrhage; pleural effusion; and, rarely, myocardial and/or hilar lymphoid involvement. In the present case, the patient presented with BD with an asymptomatic subpleural lung mass and bilateral pulmonary artery enlargement. The patient was treated with a combination of surgical and medical therapy with complete resolution of the lung involvement and without any parenchymal relapses after an 8-month follow-up.
