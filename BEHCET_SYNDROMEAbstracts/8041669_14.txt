Behçet's disease is a chronic, relapsing, idiopathic, multi-system condition characterized by mucocutaneous, ocular, gastrointestinal, articular, vascular, urogenital, and neurologic involvement. Usually the onset occurs between 20 and 30 years of age; it is very uncommon in children. We analyzed 40 cases of childhood-onset Behçet's disease. The male:female ratio was 0.67. The most frequent major sign was oral ulceration, appearing in all patients. Other major signs were genital ulcers (33 patients), skin lesions (29), and ocular lesions (11). The average time interval between the initial oral ulceration and the second major manifestation was 8.8 years. After the second major manifestation, the third and fourth features rapidly developed within one to two years. The most frequent minor sign was arthritis, occurring in 11 of 40 patients. Intestinal, neurologic, and renal involvement was also present. From our results, we concluded that oral ulceration, which is the most common initial manifestation, should not be neglected in children, since it may signal Behçet's disease.
