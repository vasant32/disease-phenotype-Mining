 OBJECTIVE: To present a case of myocardial infarction due to Behçet's syndrome. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 27-year-old man who was known to have Behçet's syndrome for 1 year presented with retrosternal fluctuating chest pain, which radiated to the epigastrium 5 h prior to admission. Coronary angiography showed total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, which was successfully treated with coronary stent implantation. CONCLUSION: This case shows that patients with Behçet's syndrome who had acute chest pain should be thoroughly examined for any signs of acute myocardial infarction.
