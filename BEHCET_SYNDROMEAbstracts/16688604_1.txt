Neuro-vasculo-Behçet's disease is considered a venous vessel disease generally in the form of cerebral venous thrombosis. Arterial involvement has been rarely reported. We present a patient with neuro-Behçet's disease who developed reversible basilar artery occlusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of neuro-Behçet's disease presenting with reversible basilar artery occlusion. Behçet's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of basilar artery occlusion.
