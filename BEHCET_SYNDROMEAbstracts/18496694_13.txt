In this open-label trial, ten male patients with active Behcet's uveitis were enrolled. Initially, two infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) were given at weeks 0 and 2. The patients continued to receive conventional therapy on recurrence of severe uveitis (RSU) attack. The patients with further attack were regularly given infliximab infusions every 8 weeks. In cases of further RSU attacks, the infusion interval was reduced to 6 weeks. The total follow-up period was 3 years. The patients were monitored for RSU, visual acuity and adverse effects. Reduction in the doses of prednisolone was also monitored. After receiving two infliximab infusions at weeks 0 and 2, three patients remained attack-free and seven patients had another RSU attack between 8th and 47th week. These patients were regularly given infliximab at 8-week intervals. Five out of seven patients remained attack-free. In two patients who had further attack, infusion frequency was increased to 6 weeks. There was a remarkable improvement in visual acuity with no significant adverse reaction except mild respiratory tract infection (two patients), headache (one patient) and mild infusion reaction (one patient). Infliximab is a safe and effective drug for the management of Behcet's uveitis. Selection of optimal dose and frequency of infusion required standardization for individual patient.
