The aim of this study was to evaluate coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Accordingly, various parameters of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems were investigated in 39 patients with BD and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers as the control group. Seven of these patients with BD had histories of thrombotic complication. Three were found to have decreased protein S activity, and one patient had diminished protein C activity. Each of those patients had experienced a thromboembolic event. Activated protein C resistance was present in two patients, one of whom had had a thromboembolic episode. Activated FVII (FVIIa), fibrinogen, and cholesterol levels were significantly higher in patients with BD than in the control group. In the patient group, plasma FVIIa level was inversely correlated with age. Plasma global fibrinolytic capacity (GFC) did not differ between the patients and control group. No statistically significant difference was found in the GFC and FVIIa levels between patients with and without histories of thrombosis. Although the coagulation system was activated in vivo in patients with BD, there was no reactive activation in the fibrinolytic system to counteract the activated coagulation system. These findings suggest a relative hypofibrinolytic state in BD.
