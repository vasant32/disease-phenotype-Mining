Intradermal tests were compared among 4 groups of Behçet's disease, other uveitis caused by unknown agent, sarcoidosis and SLE. The size of indurations of PPD, SK-SD and Candida was the largest in Behçet, followed by other uveitis, sarcoidosis and SLE in a descending order. Pustule formation was frequently seen in Behçet and other uveitis, in contrast to low incidence in sarcoidosis and not at all in SLE. Using saline solution or phosphate-buffered saline reaction, however, Behçet group shows erythema formation rather frequently which differentiate Behçet disease from other uveitis, sarcoidosis and SLE.
