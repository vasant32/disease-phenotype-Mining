A patient with Beh√ßet's disease had recurrent bilateral uveitis with retinal exudates and visual deterioration while under intermittent corticosteroid treatment. His peripheral blood lymphocytes showed the following abnormalities: low percentage of T cells; low T cell suppressor activity; high spontaneous B cell proliferation; and high response to phytohemagglutinin. Prostaglandin-producing adherent cells were found to have suppressive activity. Chlorambucil induced a clinical and immunological remission.
