 OBJECTIVES: Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare and serious complication of Behçet's disease, and is the result of occlusion of the major hepatic veins, the adjacent inferior vena cava, or both. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, clinical and laboratory findings, and treatment and clinical course of Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with Behçet's disease. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the charts of 220 patients fulfilling the international diagnostic criteria of Behçet's disease. From them, we selected those with Budd-Chiari syndrome, and analyzed their epidemiological and clinical imaging features and outcomes. RESULTS: Seven male patients, mean age 29 years and already diagnosed with Behçet's disease, had Budd-Chiari syndrome. The clinical course was from subacute to chronic in all cases. Thrombosis of hepatic veins was associated with inferior vena cava thrombosis in six cases. Four patients had other venous thromboses (superior vena cava and lower limbs) and one also had pulmonary emboli. One patient was positive for anticardiolipin antibodies. All patients had anticoagulation therapy, and six had high-dose corticotherapy associated, in two cases, with monthly cyclophosphamid intravenous pulses. Clinical outcome was favourable in six cases, and one patient died of hepatic failure. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Budd-Chiari syndrome in patients with Behçet's disease is 3.2%, confirming that this syndrome is not uncommon in Behçet's patients. The inferior vena cava is frequently involved in combination with hepatic veins and often associated with other venous thrombosis. The prognosis may be favorable with medical interventions, including anticoagulation, treatment of the vasculitis and the use of diuretics when required.
