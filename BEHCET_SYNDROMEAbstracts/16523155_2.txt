INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Th1 (IFN-gamma and IL-12), Th2 (IL-10) cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in the immunopathologic mechanisms of uveitis related to Behçet's disease and isolated idiopathic uveitis. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This study was conducted on 24 patients with Behçet's syndrome who had active uveitis, ten of whom showed isolated uveitis classified as idiopathic uveitis, and 13 healthy controls. The levels of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-10 in sera and supernatants of PBMC cultures stimulated by PHA were estimated using immunoenzymatic dosage (ELISA sandwich according to the methods recommended by Immunotech France). The production of NO was measured in vivo and in vitro for the same patients using the modified Griess method. RESULTS: The induction of IFN-gamma and IL-12 was higher in the two groups of patients than in the controls (P<0.001). Significant IL-10 levels were recorded in 56.5% of patients with Behçet's disease presenting uveitis versus 30% of patients with idiopathic uveitis. NO production was more pronounced in idiopathic uveitis than in Behçet's syndrome (P<0.02). CONCLUSION: The predominance of the Th1 profile was associated with high production of NO in idiopathic uveitis. A Th1/Th2 profile with a moderated increase in NO production was observed in Behçet's disease. Our data have a clinical impact. The observation of combined Th1/Th2 cytokines and NO elevation in both in vivo an in vitro experiments could have a predictive value in characterizing uveitis associated with Behçet's disease.
