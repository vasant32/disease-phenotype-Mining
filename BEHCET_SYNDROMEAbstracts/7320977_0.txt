The authors describe the radiological features of a patient with Behcet's disease, who had oesogastric ulcers and a terminal ileitis as major part of this clinical syndrome. The radiologic appearance of these localisations are discussed. The similarities of Behcet's disease to Crohn's disease are outlined.
