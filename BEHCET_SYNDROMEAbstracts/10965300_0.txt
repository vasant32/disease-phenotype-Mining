Behçet's disease is a multiple disorder in which urogenital involvement mainly consists of genital aphthous ulcers, epididymitis, urethritis and recurrent cystitis. We report 2 cases of neurogenic bladder due to Behçet's disease. Both cases showed detrusor hyperreflexia and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. One case has been managed by twice-daily intravesical oxybutynin treatment (5 mg/10 ml) and clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) 7 times/day, and the other case has been managed by CIC 6 times/day.
