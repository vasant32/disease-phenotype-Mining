Elevation of serum anti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) has been reported in patients with Crohn's disease. We analysed the subclasses of Immunoglobulin (Ig) G reaction in ASCA in sera from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, healthy controls, and patients with intestinal Behçet's disease. Serum samples were obtained from 29 patients with Crohn's disease, 30 patients with ulcerative colitis, 7 patients with intestinal Behçet's disease, and 12 healthy controls. Serum IgG subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 of ASCA were analysed using ELISA. IgG4 ASCA was significantly increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In patients with intestinal Behçet's disease, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 ASCA were increased. Differential responses, in terms of subclasses in ASCA, were found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with intestinal Behçet's disease, which may represent different pathophysiologies of these intestinal inflammatory diseases.
