OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential associations between toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to, clinical features, and severity of Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: A total of 189 Italian patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD and 210 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors were genotyped for two coding single nucleotide polymorphisms of TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) by molecular methods. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of clinical manifestations. Severity score was calculated.RESULTS: The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between the BD patients and the healthy controls. No significant associations were found when BD patients with and those without clinical manifestations were compared. No association between TLR4 polymorphisms and severity score was observed.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the TLR4 gene polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to, clinical expression of, and severity of BD in Italian patients.
