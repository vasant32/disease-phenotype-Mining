Isotretinoin-induced keloid formation has occasionally been reported in patients who have undergone dermabrasion or laser treatment. This report describes a man with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) who was prescribed isotretinoin for nodulocystic acne. After approximately 8 weeks of this treatment, the patient developed extensive keloids. There are no previous reports of possible isotretinoin-induced keloid formation in the setting of BD. This article discusses possible connections between BD, keloid formation and isotretinoin, which may be manifested in this case.
