Herein, we report 3 cases of Beh√ßet syndrome that were accompanied by intracardiac thrombus. The 1st patient was a 30-year-old man who presented with dyspnea; a right atrial thrombus was identified upon transthoracic echocardiography. The 2nd patient was a 52-year-old man who was admitted for dyspnea; transthoracic echocardiography revealed an echogenic mass in the right ventricle. The 3rd patient was a 23-year-old man who was hospitalized for hemoptysis; the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made, and right ventricular thrombosis was found.Because these patients had no hemodynamic compromise, medical management consisting of immunosuppressive and anticoagulative therapy was adopted. This treatment resulted in complete dissolution of the thrombi.
