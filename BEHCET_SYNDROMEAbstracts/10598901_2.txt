Right ventricular thrombus is a very rare manifestation of cardiovascular Behcet's disease. A 25-year-old man was admitted to hospital due to cough and fever of unknown origin. He experienced repetitive pulmonary embolism due to a right ventricular thrombus, which was surgically removed. A diagnosis of Behcet's disease was made based on his clinical course and the histological findings of the right ventricular wall and the skin lesion. He was quickly relieved of his symptoms after warfarinization and cyclosporine therapy.
