Nocardia spp., a group of gram-positive variably acid-fast aerobic bacteria, are opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. We here-within describe 2 cases of widespread nocardiosis in patients with Behcet's disease. In addition to endogen endophthalmitis in case 1, both cases developed lung, brain and skin involvement. Despite brain involvement, the prognosis was good, although vision was completely lost in case 1, which was directly attributable to a delay in both diagnosis and treatment.
