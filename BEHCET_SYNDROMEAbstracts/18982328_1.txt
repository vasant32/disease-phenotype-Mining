Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory, multisystem vasculitis. Neurological involvement is one of the most serious manifestations of Behçet's disease. Although brain stem and diencephelon are the most affected areas in neuro-Behçet's disease, spinal cord involvement are rarely seen. We report a case of paraplegia caused by completely thoracic cord involvement of Behçet's disease in a 20-year-old woman.
