Among the systemic manifestations of Beh√ßet's syndrome, venous and arterial involvements are discussed. Venous thrombosis is a common manifestation and may be considered as a cardinal sign in the diagnosis. Venous and arterial thrombotic complications may be regarded as agents of morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of the occlusive process is still some what obscure, although vasculitis and impaired local vascular fibrinolytic activity play a part in it. Therapeutic measures using fibrinolytic enhancing agents may prevent and control the thrombotic complications of the disease.
