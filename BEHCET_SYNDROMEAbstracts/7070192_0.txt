A case report is given of a patient with Behçet's syndrome presenting with relapsing diarrhea and genital ulcers; similar cases from the literature are discussed. Neither the radiological nor the colonoscopic symptoms are typical in Behçet's syndrome and thus do not allow differentiating it from other forms of colitis. For that reason all forms of colitis accompanied by extraintestinal lesions, especially genital ulceration, should give rise to the suspicion of Behçet's syndrome.
