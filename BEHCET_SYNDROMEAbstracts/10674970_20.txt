Behçet's disease has been known to be strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B51, one of the split antigens of HLA-B5. An increased incidence of HLA-B51 in the patient group has also been reported in an Italian population. Since the B51 antigen has been recently identified to comprise nine alleles, B*5101-B*5109, we performed HLA-B51 allele genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method as well as serological HLA-A and -B typing among 21 Italian patients with Behçet's disease in order to investigate whether there is any correlation of one particular B51-associated allele with Behcet's disease. In addition, HLA class II genotyping was performed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. As a result, only the phenotype frequency of the B51 antigen was found to be significantly increased in the patient group as compared to the ethnically matched control group by the corrected P-value analysis (71.4% in patients vs. 17.9% in controls; chi2 = 14.26, Pc = 0.0042, R.R. = 11.5). In the B51 allele genotyping, 11 out of 15 B51-positive patients were B*5101 and the remaining four were B*5108, whereas all of 5 normal controls were B*5101, showing significant association of each allele with Behçet's disease. No significant difference was observed between the patient and control groups in the HLA class II allelic distribution. This study revealed a strong association of Behçet's disease in Italian with B*5108 as well as B*5101, providing important insight into the molecular mechanism underlying an HLA association with Behçet's disease.
