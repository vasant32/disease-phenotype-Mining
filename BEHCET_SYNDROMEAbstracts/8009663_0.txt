Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS) was first described in 1937 as the triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcerations and iritis. BS is a systemic, inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by multiorgan vasculitis. The long-term prognosis is often good, but the disease may lead to blindness and serious neurological sequelae. The broad clinical spectrum of the disease and the lack of pathognomonic lesions make the diagnosis difficult, especially in children. We report a case of BS in a child, and based on a review of the literature we describe the present diagnostic criteria, new immunological aspects, clinical course, and current therapy of the disease.
