Operative treatment of aneurysm in patients with Behçet's disease frequently results in recurrent aneurysm at the anastomosis site or in the remaining artery. Herein, in a Behçet's patient with aortic and iliac pseudoaneurysms, a ruptured iliac artery stump aneurysm after ligation of the right external iliac artery 1 year prior to this admission is reported. This case suggests that the ligation or interposition of aneurysms associated with Behçet's disease should be done at the intact artery, remote to the diseased segment. In addition, a small pseudoaneurysm of the aorta could be monitored with close follow-up with immunosuppressive medication and surveillance at regular intervals if the aneurysm is not symptomatic and is not rapidly growing to a certain critical size.
