 BACKGROUND: Adamantiades-Behcet's disease (ABD) is a multisystemic inflammatory/autoimmune disease involving both microcirculation and macrocirculation. Aortic stiffness index and aortic augmentation index (AI) are indices for the estimation of arterial stiffness and pressure wave reflections, respectively. The effect of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs used in ABD on these indices is unknown. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we examined 74 subjects with ABD (aged 40.1 +/- 12.5 years, 24 men) and 24 control subjects by using the noninvasive technique of radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis for assessment of aortic AI by application of transfer functions. Echocardiography was used for assessment of aortic stiffness index. Classic cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, left ventricular and endothelial function of the brachial artery, as well as intima-media thickness of carotid artery, were also assessed. RESULTS: Corticosteroids were the only drug having a negative and independent effect on aortic AI, but not on aortic stiffness. Patients taking corticosteroids had lower aortic AI and central systolic blood pressure (BP), but not aortic stiffness and peripheral systolic BP, when compared to those without corticosteroids (21+/-14% v 12+/-14%, P < .050). Medication, traditional CV risk factors, and functional or structural CV parameters were all comparable among the two groups. The AI was similar between the control group and patients with ABD taking corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: The AI, but not aortic stiffness, is lower in patients with ABD taking corticosteroids compared to patients not taking corticosteroids and similar to the control group. These results imply a role of inflammation or immunomodulatory mechanisms in the regulation of pressure wave reflections.
