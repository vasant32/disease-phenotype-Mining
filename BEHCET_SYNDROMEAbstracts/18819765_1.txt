Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitis characterized by the association of recurrent oral and genital ulcers to systemic involvements, particularly ocular, nervous and vascular manifestations. Contrary to other vasculitis, prolonged fever of unknown origin is rare in Behçet's disease. We report a case of a 26-year-old man presenting prolonged fever for two months. Physical examination showed oral, genital ulcers and pseudofolliculitis. The sedimentation rate was increased. Chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed thrombus in the inferior vena cava and portal vena. Outcome was favorable with glucocorticoid and anticoagulant therapy. Prolonged fever occurring during Behçet's disease should prompt a search for a vascular injury.
