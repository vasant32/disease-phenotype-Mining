Arterial aneurysm formation is a rare manifestation in Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Aneurysm rupture is the main cause of death among BD patients. In recent years, endovascular treatment has been proposed as an effective and less invasive procedure compared with classical surgical treatment. We report the case of a 29-year-old man with BD who had two syncopes precipitated by pressure on a left cervical mass and hemoptysis. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed acute infarction of left basal ganglia. Other examinations demonstrated carotid and pulmonary aneurysms that were treated by endovascular methods. The patient received treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. First of all, the pulmonary aneurysm was treated by means of coil embolization. After anticoagulant therapy was initiated, a covered stent was placed to exclude the carotid aneurysm at the level of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), with no immediate complications. After twenty-seven months of follow-up the patient remains asymptomatic. Endovascular treatment may be a definite therapeutic option for extracranial carotid aneurysms in BD, although longer term follow-up studies are needed.
