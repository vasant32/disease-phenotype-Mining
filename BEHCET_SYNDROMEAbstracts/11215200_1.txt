Behçet disease is a systemic vasculitis of unknown cause with variable clinical features. The central nervous system may also be involved in about 10% of the patients with Behçet disease. Half of them show marked central nervous system symptoms and are diagnosed as neuro-Behçet disease. Voiding symptom is seen in about 5% of the patients with neuro-Behçet disease. We report a case of neuropathic vesico-urethral dysfunction in a 39-year-old man with neuro-Behçet disease. Its radiological and urodynamic features and treatment are also presented with some discussion.
