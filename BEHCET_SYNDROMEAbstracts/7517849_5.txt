We studied 54 patients with Behçet's disease, 41 males and 13 females, mean age 28 years. Forty-four patients had auditory brain-stem evoked potential (BAEP) recordings, 39 had pattern reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP), 27 had median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) recordings, and 25 tibial nerve SEPs. BAEPs were abnormal in 16 patients (52%) with neurological manifestations and in 4 (31%) without, because of decreased amplitude of wave V, prolonged I-III or III-V interpeak latencies, or uncertain/absent waves III and/or V. Eleven patients (40%) with neurological symptoms and 3 patients (25%) without, had abnormal VEPs. Absent potentials, decreased amplitude, with or without prolonged P100 latency, were found in 75% of the cases, the rest had prolonged P100 latency only. Median SEPs were abnormal in 8 patients (38%) with neurological manifestations. Four patients (21%) had abnormal tibial SEPs. Decreased amplitude with or without mild slowing in central conduction was the predominant SEP abnormality. SEPs were normal in all patients without neurological symptoms. In total, 84% of patients with, and 38% of patients without, neurological symptoms had abnormalities of one or more EP modality. When used cautiously, EP studies in Behçet's disease might be helpful to separate neuro-Behçet from other disorders with similar symptomatology, to disclose subclinical CNS involvement, to evaluate and monitor CNS disease activity, and to provide objective measures of treatment response.
