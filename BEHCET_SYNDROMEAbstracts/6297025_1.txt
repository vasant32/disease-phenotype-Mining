The case of a twenty-one-year-old man who was hospitalized for unexpected bilateral phlebitis of the lower limbs is reported. Clinical features suggested a systemic disease, especially Behçet disease although the classical triad was lacking. Laparoscopy showed two lesions identical to canker sores on the hepatic capsule. There were no biological hepatic disorders and histological examination of a needle biopsy specimen was normal. This clinical report is additional evidence in support of the idea that Behçet is syndrome is a systemic disease.
