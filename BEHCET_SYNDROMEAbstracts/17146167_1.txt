We present a rare case of invasive right breast carcinoma in a 72-year-old woman with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). A radical modified right mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy were performed and postoperative hormonal therapy with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole was administered for adjuvant therapy. At 10 months follow-up the patient remains disease free. Malignancies associated with BD are very uncommon. The pathological findings showed small vessel vasculitis and lobulitis of the breast in association with invasive carcinoma.
