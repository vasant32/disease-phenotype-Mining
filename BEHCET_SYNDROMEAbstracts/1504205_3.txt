We present a 56-year-old patient with episodes of recurrent abdominal pain and constitutional syndrome, whose evolution was complicated by mucous ulcers in mouth, esophagus, anus and ileocecal valve, as well as occasional aphthae in scrotum. All these clinical signs are compatible with a Beh√ßet's disease with relevant digestive manifestations.
