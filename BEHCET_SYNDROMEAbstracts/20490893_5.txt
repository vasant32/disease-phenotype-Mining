To determine the efficacy of infliximab treatment in refractory posterior uveitis in Behçet's disease after withdrawal of infusions. Four patients with posterior uveitis secondary to Behçet's disease were treated with infliximab until complete remission and were followed after withdrawal of infusions. Intra-ocular inflammation was assessed using the binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy score, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and foveal thickness measured by optic coherence tomography (OCT). All the patients included in the study were treated with infliximab for a minimum of 12 months and were in complete remission. None of the patients were taking steroids or immunosuppressants. Main follow-up after withdrawal of infusions was 7.5 months. Two out of four patients (50%) maintained complete remission of posterior uveitis. BCVA was stable in seven eyes. OCT showed worsening in macular edema in the two eyes of the patients with reactivation. Infliximab is an efficient long-term treatment for refractory posterior uveitis. Repeated infusions are required to maintain long-term remission which may be sustained on discontinuation of the drug.
