A 25-year-old man developed sudden pain and a pulsating mass in the left thigh. A diagnosis of Beh√ßet's disease was made because of four major symptoms. Laboratory data indicated active inflammation. Emergency spiral computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed an aneurysm of the left superficial femoral artery (SFA). Under steroid therapy, follow-up spiral CTA showed spontaneous occlusion of the aneurysm. In the active phase of arteritis, spiral CTA is useful for the diagnosis of arterial lesions to avoid the arterial puncture of conventional arteriography.
