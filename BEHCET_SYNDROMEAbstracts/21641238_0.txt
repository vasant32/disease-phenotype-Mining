 INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to report our experience with 23 patients presenting with 32 peripheral aneurysms secondary to Behcet's disease (BD) and their outcome after vascular surgery. METHODS: The study was retrospective in nature. Except for those presenting with aneurysm rupture, patients underwent surgery after treatment of acute inflammatory lesions. All aneurysms appeared to be pseudo-aneurysms. Graft interposition with polytetrafluoroethylene or saphenous vein was most commonly employed. Postoperatively, all patients were put on immunosuppressive and antiplatelet therapy. Follow-up was done every 6-12 months, complications recorded and managed appropriately. RESULTS: All the patients were males. The mean age at diagnosis of a peripheral aneurysm was 41.0 ± 9 years. There were 17 (53%) femoral, 8 (25%) popliteal, two carotid, two external iliac, two brachial and one internal iliac aneurysms. Fourteen (61%) patients had a single peripheral aneurysm while nine had two. Surgery was performed for all initially presenting 23 aneurysms. Six patients with multiple peripheral aneurysms had surgery for their second asymptomatic aneurysm. The mean follow-up period was 84 ± 62 months. Of 29 aneurysms operated on, 7 (24%) anastomotic pseudo-aneurysms and 11 (38%) graft occlusions developed. Five (22%) patients underwent major lower extremity amputations. Six (26%) mortalities were recorded. CONCLUSION: Surgery for peripheral aneurysms in BD is warranted in many instances. Results of operation can be improved by prolonged monitoring. However, despite all efforts, peripheral aneurysm involvement in BD worsens the prognosis.
