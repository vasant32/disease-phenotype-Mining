The aim of the present study was to describe a case of Behçet's disease revealed by a recurrent meningitis and to review literature on these two conditions. We describe the case of a 25-year-old man who presented four episodes of recurrent meningitis without any locoregional cause and developed oral and genital ulcerations few months later. Behçet's disease is a chronic, multisystemic disorder with variable prevalence in different geographical areas. Its neurological manifestations are well recognized. Both central and peripheral nervous systems can be involved. Recurrent meningitis in Behçet's disease is exceptional. To our knowledge, only two cases reported recurrent meningitis as initial manifestation of Behçet's disease. This case report underscores another facet of neurological manifestations of Behçet's disease.
