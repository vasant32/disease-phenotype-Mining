A 77-year-old man was diagnosed as having essential thrombocythemia in 1992. Treatment with hydroxyurea was started in 1997, which stabilized the platelet count. The patient then suffered from pharyngalgia and rhinitis with a high fever, immediately after which he developed tarry stools and anemia and was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination revealed splenomegaly, oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers and skin lesions on the lower limbs. His hematological and biochemical tests revealed anemia and increased level of C-reactive protein. He also had an HLA-B51 phenotype. The findings of gastro-intestinal and colon fiberoscopy showed a duodenal ulcer and multiple ulcers on ascending colon. He was thus diagnosed as having intestinal tract-type Beh√ßet disease. After withdrawal of the hydroxyurea administration, the intestinal ulcers, oral aphthous ulcers and genital ulcers improved.
