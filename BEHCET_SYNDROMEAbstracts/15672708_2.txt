Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS) is a rare multisystem disorder belonging to a group of neutrophilic dermatoses. We report a 65-year-old male patient who had suffered from recurrent painful orogenital ulcers for 50 years from the age of 15 and started developing pustular and bullous lesions evolving into non-healing ulcers similar to those seen in pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) two months prior to presenting to us. There was no evidence of systemic disease or malignancy. Routine baseline investigations were within normal limits. The patient was treated successfully with dapsone, antibiotics, and local wound care.
