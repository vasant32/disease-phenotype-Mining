A 40-year-old Turkish man on busulphan treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia was hospitalized with steroid resistant (up to 100 mg prednisolone/24 h for over 4 weeks) colitis. On the basis of concomitant orogenital ulceration and unusual, deep punched out ulcers in the colon and smaller ulcers in the terminal ileum, Beh√ßet's disease of the bowel, manifesting as ileocolitis, was diagnosed. Leukaemic infiltration, Crohn's colitis, neutropenic colitis and infectious colitis were excluded by histology and cultures. Treatment with colchicine 2 mg/day improved the orogenital ulcers but with only minor improvement of the colitis. Thalidomide treatment (400 mg/day), however, dramatically improved the colitis within 7 days: fever and diarrhoea disappearing. Colonoscopy after 4 weeks of treatment revealed previously giant ulcers practically healed.
