 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to establish the usefulness of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and psychological tests for diagnostic of neuro-Behçet (NB) and to evaluate the clinical significance of neurological symptoms that are difficult to interpret and asymptomatic abnormalities in diagnostic tests. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty patients with Behçet's disease (BD) were enrrolled for being studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), SPECT and psychological tests. RESULTS: MRI findings were abnormal in 52,9% of patients with neurological involvement and 23.1% without it (p < 0.1), whereas SPECT findings were abnormal in 82.3% and 61.5%, respectively (no significant difference). The difference between MRI and SPECT findings was significant (p < 0.02 for the complete group; p < 0.05 for patients without neurological symptoms; p < 0.08 for patients with them). The mean follow-up period was 42.6 months, and no patient without neurological involvement or those only with neurological symptoms that are difficult to interprete developed definite neurological involvement. The results of cognitive tests were not significantly different among patients with or without neurological involvement, neither among patients and controls. The scale 2 (depression) of the personality test was more frequent in patients with definite neurological involvement (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SPECT seems more sensible and less specific than MRI for diagnostic of NB. Although SPECT findings were frequently abnormal in patients with BD without neurological involvement or with neurological symptoms hard to interpret, no patient from this group developed a NB flare after a long follow-up period. A characteristic personality was found for patients with BD.
