 PURPOSE: To define the indocyanine green (ICG) and fundus fluorescein angiographic (FFA) features of Behçet's disease. METHODS: The study included 49 eyes of 25 patients (19 males, 6 females; mean age: 34.1 years; age range: 14-68 years) with Behçet's disease and active ocular involvement that fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet's Disease. In each patient, FFA and ICG angiography were performed consecutively in the same session using a TRC-50I/A fundus camera (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) coupled to an Image Net digitizing system. All images were analyzed and FFA, ICG, and clinical findings summarized. RESULTS: The mean duration of ocular involvement was 52.4 months (range: 2-240 months). FFA showed staining and dye leakage at the optic disc in 44 (89.8%) eyes and diffuse vasculitis in 36 (73.5%) eyes. Macular edema and ischemia were observed in 31 (63.3%) and 3 (6.1%) eyes, respectively. Eight (16.3%) eyes exhibited detectable retinal FFA alterations, but no abnormalities on ICG angiography. Disc ICG hyperfluorescence was observed in 23 (46.9%) eyes. ICG angiography revealed choroidal fuzziness in 16 (32.6%) eyes, hyperfluorescent spots in 13 (26.5%) eyes, and hypofluorescent plaques in 12 (24.5%) eyes. Eleven eyes (22.4%) showed no abnormal findings on ICG angiography. CONCLUSION: ICG and FFA complement each other as tools for diagnosing patients with Behçet's disease. FFA often serves as a fairly reliable guide. Although some ICG findings cannot be demonstrated by FFA, they are not specific or pathognomonic. We do not recommend performing both procedures for Behçet's disease.
