 BACKGROUND: There is a need for a laboratory marker that correlates with the clinical activity of Behçet's disease (BD). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether serum galectin-3 (Gal-3) levels were affected during the course of the disease with regard to disease activity. METHODS: A total of 131 subjects were involved in the study as follows: Group 1: BD active (n = 39); Group 2: BD inactive (n = 31); Group 3: Disease controls with leucocytoclastic vasculitis confirmed with a skin biopsy (n = 22); and Group 4: Healthy control subjects (n = 39). The BD patients were followed regularly and samples were taken in their active and inactive periods of the disease over a 2-year period. RESULTS: Serum Gal-3 levels were significantly higher in active BD patients (mean 2.38) than inactive BD patients (mean 0.63; P < 0.0001) and the healthy control subjects (mean 0.75; P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the leucocytoclastic vasculitis and active BD patients (P = 0.093). Serum Gal-3 levels were positively correlated with clinical activity scores of active BD patients (r = 0.66, P < 0.0001). In addition, the Gal-3 levels were significantly higher in the active disease period when compared with the inactive period during the follow-up. There were no significant differences between the two inactive periods of the disease among the same patients. Further analyses revealed that patients with vascular involvement had significantly higher Gal-3 levels than the other active BD patients (mean 7.57; P = 0.007). LIMITATIONS: The limitation of the study is the small number of patients with vascular involvement in the active BD patient group. CONCLUSION: Gal-3 levels are correlated with the activity of Behçet's disease especially with the vascular involvement.
