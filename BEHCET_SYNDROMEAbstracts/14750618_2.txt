 PURPOSE: To study the prevalence, manifestations and severity of ocular involvement in Indian patients with Behcet's disease. METHOD: Prospective analysis of all patients of suspected Behcet's disease between 1997 and 2001. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were diagnosed to have Behcet's disease. Ocular manifestations were seen in 36% patients. The commonest manifestation was conjunctival ulcer (26.3%), followed by iridocyclitis (10.5%). None of the patients had posterior segment involvement or visual loss. Response to topical corticosteroids was good. CONCLUSION: The prevalence and severity of ocular lesions in Behcet's disease is relatively low in Indian patients. Conjunctival ulcers was a common finding, which is rarely reported in the world literature.
