We present a 34-year-old man with a two-year history of aphthous stomatitis, who later developed painful, erythematous nodules on his lower extremities. A pathergy test was positive, and the diagnosis of Beh√ßet syndrome (BS) was made. It is important for the dermatologist to recognize the wide variety of cutaneous manifestations of this disorder. A pathergy test is a simple diagnostic tool that may assist in making a diagnosis. Case reports of other unusual skin manifestations in BS also are reviewed.
