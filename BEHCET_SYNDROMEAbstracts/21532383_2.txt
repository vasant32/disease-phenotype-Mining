 AIM: To assess the clinical patterns of neurologic involvement and the frequencies and characteristics of different types of headaches in patients with Behçet disease. METHODS: Total 530 patients with Behçet disease were evaluated for the presence of neurologic involvement and/or headache. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients (10.2%) with neurological involvement, 36 (66.7%) had parenchymal and 16 (29%) had vascular involvement. There was a patient with optic neuropathy and another patient with peripheral nerve involvement. There were 46 patients (8.7%) with headache without any evidence of neurological involvement and 25 of them (4.7%) were diagnosed with migraine. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of neurologic involvement in our group was higher than the studies published previously from the same country. Migraine prevalence on the other hand was low.
