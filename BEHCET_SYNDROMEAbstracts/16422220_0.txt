We report a case of Behcet's disease in a pregnant woman associated with secondary Frosted Branch Angiitis (FBA). FBA is a rare entity characterized by a florid translucent retinal perivascular sheathing of both arterioles and venules, with variable uveitis, retinal oedema and visual loss. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of FBA secondary to Behcet's disease in pregnancy.
