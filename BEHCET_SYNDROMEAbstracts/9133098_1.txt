Behçet's disease is considered to be a systemic process caused by a nonspecific vasculitis with a diversity of symptoms. It is defined by the coexistence of aphthous stomatitis, genital ulcerations, inflammatory conditions of the eye such as iritis and dermatological changes. Cardiovascular involvement includes both arteries and veins. We report an unusual case of thrombosis of the inferior vena cava with extensive collateral circulation of the superficial abdominal and paravertebral veins due to Behçet's disease diagnosed by phlebography and magnetic resonance imaging.
