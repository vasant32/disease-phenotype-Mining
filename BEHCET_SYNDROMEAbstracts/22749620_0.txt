Intracardiac thrombosis is a rare complication of Beh√ßet's disease. It may be isolated or associated with arterial disease. We report a case of a patient from northern Morocco, aged 23, without specific medical history. He consulted for recurrent hemoptysis of middle abundance, associated with bipolar aphthosis. Chest radiography showed a left basal opacity fuzzy and right paracardiac opacity. The thoracic CT objectified left segmental lower lobe embolism, an aneurysm of a segmental branch of the right lower lobe and right intraventricular thrombus. Echocardiography confirmed the intracardiac thrombus. The patient was treated by oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, colchicine, and anticoagulants. The outcome was favorable with complete resolution of intraventricular thrombus and the aneurysm.
