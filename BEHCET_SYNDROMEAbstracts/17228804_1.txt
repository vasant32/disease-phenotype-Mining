A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital in 1994 because of fever, and abdominal CT showed multiple low-density areas in the liver. Although granulomas were found in a liver biopsy specimen, a definitive diagnosis could not be established. With complaints of oral and genital ulcerations and erythema nodosum, Behçet disease was diagnosed in 1995 and he was treated with colchicine and cyclosporin. In May 1997 he had fever, leg edema, and proteinuria, and a renal biopsy revealed secondary amyloidosis. Cavitary lesions were found on a chest X-ray for the first time, but these later disappeared spontaneously. In October 2002, nodular shadows, cavitary lesions, and a mediastinal tumor appeared on a chest X-ray film. The nodular shadows in the lung fields had transformed into cavity lesions, resulting in the disappearance of the shadows. Specimens obtained from an open lung biopsy showed necrotizing granulomas and destructive vasculitis of the lung, and aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk caused by destructive vasculitis. Because multiple nodular shadows with cavitary lesions in Behçet disease, as in this case, have never been reported, we think this is a rare case.
