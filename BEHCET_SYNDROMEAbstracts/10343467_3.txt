Interferons have been used for the treatment of many diseases because of their immunomodulatory, antiviral, antitumoral, and antiproliferative effects. Systemic interferon alpha 2a (IFN-alpha 2a) is also efficacious in the management of Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Many adverse cutaneous reactions related to IFN-alpha have been reported. In the light of the current literature, we report here the first case of Pityriasis rosea (PR) that developed while receiving IFN-alpha 2a for BD. However, since this is the first report on this association, further observations are needed to determine their clinical relevance.
