A 23-year-old man suffering from Beh√ßet's disease developed a tracheoesophageal fistula. Subtotal esophagus was stripped and replaced with a gastric tube along greater curvature. The defect of membranous portion of the trachea (2 X 1 cm) was closed with a pedicled pericardial patch and covered with omentum. Transient postoperative recurrent nerve palsy was recovered in about 2 months. He is going well without any significant complaints. He received steroid hormone administration and platelets transfusion because of complicated ITP (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura).
