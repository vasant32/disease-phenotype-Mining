T cells and T-cell subsets were determined in the peripheral blood of 12 patients with Behçet's syndrome and 30 normal healthy control subjects. When compared with the control group, the mean percentage of T cells for the group with Behçet's syndrome was significantly decreased (73% v 61%). The mean percentage of T mu (helper) cells for the group with Behçet's syndrome (26%) was also significantly decreased from the mean value of the control group (42%). There was a concomitant significant increase of T gamma (suppressor) cells of the group with Behçet's syndrome (19%) over the mean value of the control group (10%). These results clearly indicated that there were alterations of T cells and T-cell subsets in this disease.
