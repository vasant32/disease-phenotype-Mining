 BACKGROUND: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic inflammatory disorder found in individuals with a particular genetic background. Hemostatic studies in BD support an imbalance towards a prothrombotic state at different levels. Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) has atherogenic and thrombogenic properties. It is mostly under genetic regulation. We investigated the possible relationship between Lp(a) and BD. METHODS: Forty patients diagnosed with BD and 40 healthy controls were enrolled. The clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, and Lp(a) levels of the two groups were assessed and compared statistically. RESULTS: All patients (100%) had oral aphthous ulcers. Thirty (75%) had genital ulceration, 37 (92.5%) had either erythema nodosum or papulopustular lesions, and 10 (25%) had eye involvement. Twelve (30%) had a positive pathergy test. Four (10%) had vascular involvement. The Lp(a) level of the patient population was 19.6+/-18.8 mg/dL. This level was higher than that of the controls, but not statistically significant. The Lp(a) levels of the four patients with vascular complications were within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Lp(a) is of interest, as it is a genetically determined parameter that was found to be high in BD patients in our study group. The levels were independent of thrombotic complications, perhaps suggesting a different role for this lipoprotein in the etiopathogenesis of BD. Further studies with a larger number of patients are essential to discover the exact role of Lp(a) in BD.
