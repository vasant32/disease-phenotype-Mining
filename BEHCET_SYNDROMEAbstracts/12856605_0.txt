This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical application of the millimeter wave and magnetism light compound therapy. The EHF-98B MMW. RL compound therapy apparatus made in the University of Electronic Technology(Chengdu) was used in 171 patients. The superficial, skin lesions or the visceral reflected skin regions (acupoints) were directly exposed to the light from the apparatus. All the cases were divided into five groups, namely skin mucosa superficial lesions, trauma of the bone and joint soft tissue, surgical incision, ENT infections, and rare intricate diseases. The therapeutic effects observed in the groups were analyzed and evaluated by means of 4 levels. As for the 171 patients, the cure rate was 42.7% (73 patients), the effective rate 25.1%(43 patients), the improvement rate 31%(53 patients), and no effect constituted 1.2%(2 patients). The total effective rate was 98.8%. This therapy was especially effective for treating chronic cervicitis, cervical erosion, soft tissue trauma, surgical incision. Also it was effective for treating some rare intricate diseases, e.g. sterility, vitiligo, Behcet disease. So the millimeter wave and magnetism light compound therapy may find wide clinical applications.
