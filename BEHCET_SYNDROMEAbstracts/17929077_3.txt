Behcet's syndrome is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause, characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. Behcet's syndrome with predominant vascular involvement is known as vasculo-Behcet. Arterial complications occur in only 1 to 7% of patients with Behcet's syndrome. In most reports, arterial lesions are isolated. We report a case of Behcet's syndrome that, over 6 years, developed multiple aneurysms in peripheral arteries and aorta without any coexisting venous thrombosis. An increased awareness of Behcet's syndrome and its vascular complications is essential. This is highlighted by the fact that our patient had to undergo four surgeries and many years of diagnostic uncertainty before reaching at the final diagnosis.
