The authors report the formation of a subtenon cyst following subtenon triamcinolone injection for chronic recurrent uveitis in Beh√ßet's disease. The steroid was inadvertently placed superficially in the anterior subtenon space and was encapsulated eventually to present as a subtenon cyst. The episode of uveitis recurrence, which did not regress, required treatment with a repeat posterior subtenon injection 2 months later. The cyst was removed 4.5 months after the initial subtenon injection, when the patient underwent a trabeculectomy for refractory glaucoma. Histological examination of the cyst revealed a fibrous encapsulated cavity filled with small birefringent crystals, consistent with an encapsulated triamcinolone collection. Fibrous encapsulation of triamcinolone crystals can arise after a superficially placed anterior subtenon injection and this may impede the absorption of the corticosteroid and hamper its effectiveness in treating ocular inflammatory diseases.
