Five patients with Behçet's disease were satisfactorily treated with colchicine. Oral aphthosis, erythema nodosum-like lesions and genital erosions improved greatly within a month as did laboratory findings. We believe colchicine to be the first choice in the management of the cutaneous and ocular lesions of Behçet's disease.
