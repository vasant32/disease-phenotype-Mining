A 50-year-old housewife with a main complaint of dyspnea was admitted to our hospital in September, 1992. In 1975, the patient developed aphthous stomatitis, genital aphthous ulcers, uveitis and erythema nodosum appeared and diagnosed as having Behcet's disease at Department of Dermatology of our hospital. Aortic regurgitation was pointed out in 1984. Hyperlipidemia appeared in January and Oral prednisolone was started in May, 1985. From April in 1987, proteinuria appeared. From January, 1988, urinal protein was greater than 300 mg/dl. Orthopnea appeared in July, 1992. Physical examinations revealed systolic and diastolic murmur and pretibial edema. Laboratory findings showed proteinuria (3.8 g/day) and hypoproteinemia (serum total protein 5.1 g/dl, serum albumin 3.1 g/dl). Microscopic findings of renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and arteriosclerosis. Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated deposits of Apo B in the basement membrane and the mesangium. She was discharged from our hospital as proteinuria was decreased after a combination treatment with camostat mesilate 600 mg and SAIREITO 9.0 g. This patient developed nephrotic syndrome, which was caused by hypertension and hyperlipidemia in addition to Behcet's disease. This case is noteworthy because Behcet's disease is rarely complicated with nephrotic syndrome.
