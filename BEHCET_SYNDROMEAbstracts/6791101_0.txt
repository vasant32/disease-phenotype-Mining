Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of undetermined cause. The most frequent manifestations are aphthous ulceration of the upper aerodigestive tract, genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, and arthritis. Less frequent features include involvement of the CNS, thrombophlebitis, and large-vessel arteritis. Of utmost importance is the fact that aphthous ulceration of the upper aerodigestive tract will develop in all patients who have Behçet's disease; thus, they may come to the otorhinolaryngologist for evaluation. This disease must be distinguished from recurrent aphthous ulceration, herpes simplex infection, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Reiter's disease, pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn's disease. Behçet's disease is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features; no specific laboratory abnormalities have been noted. The histopathologic perivasculitis is non-specific. Corticosteroid administration has been the most efficacious treatment. For serious complications, such as uveitis or meningoencephalitis, immunosuppressive agents can be used.
