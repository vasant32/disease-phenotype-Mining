OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) in an Israeli Arab town (Taibe). METHODS: Questionnaires about the occurrence and prevalence of aphthous ulcers were distributed randomly to the parents of children attending a paediatric centre in Taibe. The parents were asked whether they or any of their children aged between 10 and 20 years had recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Any who had had more than four aphthous episodes (each episode lasting more than seven days) during the previous year were invited for an extensive interview and examination by a rheumatologist or a paediatrician. RESULTS: A total of 4876 subjects were included in this survey, of whom six (one male, five female) were diagnosed as having BD. Of these six, two were siblings (a brother and a sister). Five had skin lesions, four had visual involvement, and all had genital ulcers and joint symptoms; one in two patients had a positive pathergy test. Five of the six carried HLA-B5 antigens. The results showed a prevalence of 12/10,000 in Taibe. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of BD found in our survey is high and concurs with that found in other Mediterranean and Asian countries.
