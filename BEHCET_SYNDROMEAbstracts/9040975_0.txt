Behçet's disease is a complex multisystem disease of unknown origin. It presents clinically as oral, pharyngeal, and genital ulcerations, uveitis, and inflammatory papulopustules. Diagnosis is made clinically since laboratory and histologic observations are not specific. We present a patient who, despite the absence of eye and genital lesions, seems best viewed as having Behçet's disease.
