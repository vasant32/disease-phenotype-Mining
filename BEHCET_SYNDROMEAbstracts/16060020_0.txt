Colchicum holds a singular place in the History of Medicine. Many names were given through the ages: "ephemera", "finger of Hermes", "pater noster", "tue-chiens". Modern phytonyms clearly refer to the land of Colchis, a mythical place close to Armenia. Several centuries were needed to understand that, despite a frightening reputation, colchic was an elective treatment for the gout. In its long story, appears famous personages as Theophraste, Paulus Aeginata, Gilbertus Anglicus, the baron Storck and Benjamin Franklin. In modern times, colchicum has received besides gout, a wide array of new indications, among others: Behcet disease, collagen diseases and malignancies. A scarcely known chapter of genetics is the findings in 1889, by B. Pernice, an obscure physician from Palermo, of the major mitoic changes observed on gastric and intestinal mucosa of two dogs which had received large doses of colchicum. In spite of their scientific value, the works of Pernice remained largely ignored until 1949. Recent advances in colchiocotheraphy have shown fascinating new fields for research: thus in the familial Mediterranean fever, close to periodic disease, genetic disorder elective for subjects originated from all over Mediterranean and around Black Sea... the mythical country of Colchis. No other medicinal plant than colchic, except poppy, can give such records of perennial use in such a wide range of disorders.
