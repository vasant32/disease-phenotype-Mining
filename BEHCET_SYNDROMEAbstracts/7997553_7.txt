PURPOSE: To evaluate the radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) findings of patients with thoracic Behçet syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest radiographs and CT scans of nine patients with thoracic Behçet syndrome were retrospectively reviewed. Findings were compared. RESULTS: Radiographs of the nine patients showed mediastinal widening in five (56%), air-space consolidation in five (56%), and lung mass in three (33%). CT scans of the nine patients showed that mediastinal widening was due to thrombosis in four (44%) or narrowing of the superior vena cava in one [11%], which caused mediastinal edema; that air-space consolidation (seen on both radiographs and CT scans) was due to pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction in five (56%); and that lung mass was due to aneurysm of the right or left pulmonary artery in three (33%). In addition, CT scans showed hyperinflation in one patient. CONCLUSION: Chest radiographic findings of thoracic Behçet syndrome are variable and nonspecific. CT can be helpful in the assessment of the syndrome by showing thrombosis of the superior vena cava and characteristic aneurysms of the pulmonary arteries.
