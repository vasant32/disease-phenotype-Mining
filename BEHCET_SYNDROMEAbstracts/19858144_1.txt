To compare F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18 FDG-PET) and (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime ((99m)TC-HMPAO) labelled leukocyte scintigraphy for the diagnosis of vascular graft infection. A thoraco-abdominal CT-angiography and a (99m)TC-HMPAO labelled leukocyte scintigraphy did not show any graft infection in this case report whereas an F-18 FDG-PET showed a metabolic uptake around and all along the vascular graft. Further comparison between these two explorations is needed since the two techniques have not been compared in vascular graft infection.
