 BACKGROUND: Thalidomide has been identified and its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties clarified. This report expands our report of 2 entero-Behçet disease children who developed significant steroid toxicity and improved dramatically with thalidomide. Methods: We studied the effects of thalidomide in 7 juvenile-onset patients with severe, recurrent intestinal involvement of Behçet disease. Thalidomide was given at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg per day, and the dose was increased to 3 mg/kg per day if necessary (3 of 7 patients) or decreased to 1-0.5 mg/kg per day according to the responses to the drug. RESULTS: All 7 patients showed dramatic improvement in clinical symptoms with thalidomide therapy, and they successfully discontinued steroid therapy. Patients receiving thalidomide were monitored for prolonged neurotoxicity, and the treatment and a few side effects were well tolerated by all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that thalidomide can be an efficacious medication in appropriately selected patients with some inflammatory bowel diseases with many chances of success.
