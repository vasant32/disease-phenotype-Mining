Behçet's disease is a rare chronic autoimmune vasculitis with characteristic skin findings. Vascular involvement generally affects veins more than arteries, and coronary arterial involvement is extremely uncommon. Here we report the significant coronary artery aneurysms detected in a 41-year-old man with Behçet's disease who had been in remission for 13 years. Our case illustrates the necessity of initial non-invasive cardiac assessment of patients with Behçet's disease.
