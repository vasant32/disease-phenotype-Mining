 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcomes of vitreoretinal surgery for the ocular complications of Behcet's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 20 eyes of 15 patients with Beh√ßet's disease (9 men, 6 women; mean age at surgery, 31.0 +/- 1.8 years; range, 21-44 years) who had undergone vitreoretinal surgery for Behcet's disease at Ondokuz Mayis University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Samsun, Turkey, between January 2000 and September 2003. Postoperative visual acuity outcome, course of uveitis, and complications were evaluated in all patients. RESULTS: Indications for surgery were vitreous opacities in 10 eyes (50%), cystoid macular edema in 5 eyes (25%), epiretinal membrane in 3 eyes (15%), and vitreous hemorrhage in 2 eyes (10%). At the last postoperative follow-up, visual acuity had increased 2 Snellen lines or more in 10 (50%) of 20 eyes. Cystoid macular edema completely improved in 3 (60%) of 5 eyes after vitrectomy. Uveitis attacks significantly decreased during follow-up (P = .015). Immunosuppressive treatment was stopped in 11 (73%) of 15 patients. Retinal detachment and phthisis were not observed in any eye. CONCLUSION: Vitreoretinal surgery may be useful in the treatment of posterior segment complications of Behcet's disease.
