Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic relapsing systemic vasculitis in which orogenital ulceration is a prominent feature. The disease affects many systems and causes hypercoagulability. We present a 27-year-old male patient who exhibited widespread great vessel thrombosis including right atrial and ventricular thrombi in the setting of right-sided infectious endocarditis and orogenital aphthous ulcerations and erythema nodosum due to BD. We reviewed the enigmatic prothrombotic state of BD, and discuss our prior experiences in this field.
