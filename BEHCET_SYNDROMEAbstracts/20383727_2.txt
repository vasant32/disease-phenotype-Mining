This retrospective study aims to seek a relationship between the number of thrombotic events and presence of thrombophilic factors in Behcet's disease (BD). Any patient with a vascular problem evaluated for at least one thrombophilic factor was deemed eligible for the present study. Upon an evaluation of their medical records, 96 (23.9%) of the 402 patients diagnosed with BD were determined to have a history of thrombosis. Of these 96 patients, 72 (75%) had only one thrombotic attack, while the remaining 24 (25%) had two or more thrombotic attacks. Thrombophilic parameters were evaluated in only 36 of the 72 patients (50%) who had one thrombotic event (Group I) and in 18 of the 24 patients (75%) who had more than one thrombotic event (Group II). The patients with recurrent thrombotic events had a significantly higher incidence of combined thrombophilias than those patients with only one thrombotic event (8/18, 44%; 4/36, 11%; p < 0.01). The number of the patients free from thrombophilic risk factors was significantly higher in Group I than in Group II (21/36, 58%; 4/18, 22%; p < 0.02). Group II had an increased frequency of combined thrombophilic risk factors (OR 6.4; 95% CI 1.5-25.8) when compared to Group I. No significant differences were found between Groups I and II with respect to clinical features of BD. In conclusion, combined thrombophilias in patients with BD may have a role in the development of recurrent thrombotic events.
