A case of Behçet's disease with right hemiplegia and left oculomotor nerve involvement is described. Computed tomography of the brain with or without contrast, and nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrated a low attenuation mass lesion in the right mid brain. Lumbar puncture revealed there was moderate leukocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. Corticosteroids seemed effective in reducing her clinical symptoms, and our patient started walking one week after taking 50 mg of prednisolone. This case of neuro-Behçet's disease is the first with Weber's syndrome with documentation of the lesion by means of nuclear magnetic resonance.
