Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is becoming increasingly recognized as an important regulator of immune and inflammatory responses. It is released by activated T lymphocytes and macrophages and up-regulates the proinflammatory activity of these cells. MIF is required for antigen- and mitogen-driven T cell activation, and stimulates macrophages to release cytokines and nitric oxide. On the basis of the recent suggestion that pharmacological modulation of MIF production and neutralization of its activity may have important implications for treatment of a variety of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, we determined the level of MIF in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with conventional-form multiple sclerosis (C-MS) and optic-spinal form multiple sclerosis (OpS-MS), and neuro-Beh√ßet's disease (NBD). As control, the CSF of patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND) was used. The concentration of MIF in CSF samples was significantly elevated in relapsed cases of C-MS (4.13+/-1.07 ng/ml) (mean+/-S.D.) compared with control samples (2.38+/-0.60 ng/ml) (P<0.0001), whereas MIF in the CSF of C-MS patients in remission was not elevated (2.65+/-0.67 ng/ml). The concentration of MIF in the CSF of OpS-MS patients in relapse (5.53+/-1.74 ng/ml) was higher than that of patients with C-MS in relapse (P<0.05). In NBD patients, the concentration of MIF in CSF was significantly elevated (7.47+/-5.61 ng/ml) compared with control samples (P<0.01) and correlated well with cell count in these samples (r=0.910, P<0.005). These results suggest that MIF may play a pivotal role in immune-mediated diseases of the central nervous system, and that MIF may be useful in the study of differences between C-MS and OpS-MS.
