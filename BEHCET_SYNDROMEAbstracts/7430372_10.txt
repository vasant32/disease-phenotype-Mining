Endocarditis of the mitral and aortic valves is described for the first time in a patient with Behçet's disease. A second patient had minor changes in the mitral valve similar to that seen in the vasculitis which occurs in this condition. Valvulitis in Behçet's disease probably has the same pathogenesis as the vasculitis. The second patient also had a rare combination of Behçet's disease and the Budd-Chiari syndrome, and the necropsy findings are described.
