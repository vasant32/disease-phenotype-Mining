The authors report five patients with neuro-Behçet's disease. Computed tomography showed low-density lesions with or without mass effect and contrast enhancement. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed scattered areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and iso or low signal intensity on T1-weighted images with enhancement after gadolinium injection. These lesions affected all the central nervous system structures with predilection to the brain stem, basal brain ganglia, internal capsula, subcortical and deep cerebral white matter. By its availability, computed tomography remains a precious tool for diagnosis and assessment of severity of neurological involvement. Brain magnetic resonance imaging reveals silent lesions on CT, specifies their exact topography, identifies lesional association reminiscent of neuro-Behçet and contributes to the differential diagnosis with multiple sclerosis. CT and MRI permit the follow-up of lesions under treatment and evaluate prognosis.
