We present a case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated haemophagocytic syndrome in a patient with Behçet's disease. A 43-year-old man, who had been receiving treatment under the diagnosis of Behçet's disease for recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcer, ileal ulcer, and arthritis, had been admitted for fever, headache, and nausea developed 3 days ago. Laboratory data showed pancytopaenia, an increase in liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin. Haemophagocytic syndrome was diagnosed from histiocytosis and haemophagocytosis by macrophages, shown in the bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and in situ hybridization for EBV showed a positive finding. The patient recovered rapidly after steroid therapy. This is the first report of EBV-associated haemophagocytic syndrome developed in a patient with Behçet's disease.
