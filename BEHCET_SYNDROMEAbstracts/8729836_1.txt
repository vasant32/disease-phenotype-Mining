PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine aetiologies of vasculitis of retina in Morocco. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study on 108 cases of vasculitis of retina admitted in the ophthalmology department, for a 5-year period (1987-1993). Our patients had a complete ophthalmological examination : fluorescine angiography, colour vision, general examination and biological study. RESULTS: Many aetiologies have been found, predominantly Behcet's disease. The neovascularization of retina which complicates the vasculitis was detected in 30 % of our patients. A laser photocoagulation was performed on these cases, sometimes a vitrectomy was necessary when a haemorrhage of vitreous body occurred, complicating the neo-vessels of retina. The therapeutics received by our patients was based on the corticotherapy. An immunosuppression treatment was prescribed in most cases of Behcet's disease and in severe vasculitis. Outcome after treatment has been satisfactory, but many patients relapse very frequently, mainly those with Behcet's disease. CONCLUSION: Causes of vascular retinitis are variable, most of them are due to Behcet's disease.
