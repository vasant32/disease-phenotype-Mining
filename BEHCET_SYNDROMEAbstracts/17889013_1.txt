Surgical treatment of arterial Behcet's disease (BD) has a higher incidence of graft-related complications such as anastomotic pseudoaneurysm or graft occlusion. A 64-year-old man presented with a rupture of the thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms associated with BD. Evaluation shows a large hematoma in the retroperitoneum and multiple aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Physical examination and past history fulfills the diagnostic criteria of BD. The abdominal aorta was replaced with an allograft and the major branches were reconstructed with its branches. The postoperative course was uneventful. A 10-month follow-up computed tomographic scan did not show any graft-related complications. This case suggests the usefulness of an allograft for arterial involvement of BD.
