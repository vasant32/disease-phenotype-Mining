A Behçet's disease patient developed sudden cochlear hearing loss during a flare of her disease. Prednisone and cyclosporin therapy was ineffective, probably because it was initiated late. Sensorineural hearing loss is a rare but underrecognized complication of various forms of vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis and Behçet's disease. Its importance lies in the need for an early diagnosis, since prompt treatment with steroids and immunosuppressive agents may lead to restoration of hearing.
