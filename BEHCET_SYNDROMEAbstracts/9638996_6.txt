BACKGROUND: Vascular involvement of Behçet's disease is currently considered as an important sign of the clinical evolution of patients with Behçet's disease. In addition, Behçet's disease is important in that it causes peripheral arterial aneurysms. METHODS: In this report, 4 patients with vasculo-Behçet's peripheral arterial aneurysms are presented. These aneurysms were distributed in the carotid artery (n=1), popliteal artery (n=1) and femoral arteries (n=3). Operative procedures included patch closure of a perforated wall for the carotid aneurysm, arterial reconstruction with the autogenous saphenous vein for the femoral and popliteal aneurysms. RESULTS: All four patients tolerated the operation well, however, two of four patients required re-operation due to anastomotic insufficiency later. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysms associated with Behçet's disease have a sudden onset in many cases and often result in rupture. Appropriate operative procedures, including an adequate choice of anastomotic sites and reinforcement of the suture, may reduce the incidence of complications in patients with arterial aneurysms due to Behçet's disease.
