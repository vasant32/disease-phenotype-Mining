OBJECTIVE: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic inflammatory disorder classified among the vasculitides, which can affect all types and sizes of blood vessels. Vascular involvement may be seen in 25-50% of BD patients. In this study, we examined the characteristics of vascular involvement in patients with BD. METHODS: One hundred and eighty patients with BD were included in the study. The diagnosis of vascular involvement was made on clinical signs, by Doppler ultrasonography and/or angiography using computed tomographic or magnetic resonance techniques where appropriate. Detailed clinical characteristics were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (39.4%) had vascular involvement. In patients with vascular lesions, the frequency of male sex was significantly higher than in patients without vascular lesions (89.8% vs. 63.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). Of 71 BD patients with vascular involvement, 68 had venous lesions (95.8%). Three patients had arterial lesions without venous thrombosis. Eleven patients had arterial involvement with venous thrombosis. The most frequent type of vascular involvement was deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremities (n = 56, 78.9%). There was a significant association between deep venous thrombosis and superficial thrombophlebitis (r = 0.325, p < 0.01). Twenty-four patients (33.8%) had vena cava thrombosis and two had vena hepatica thrombosis. In patients with vascular involvement, the frequency of erythema nodosum was significantly higher (p = 0.001) and the frequency of ocular involvement was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in patients without vascular involvement. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates the frequency and significance of vascular involvement in BD.
