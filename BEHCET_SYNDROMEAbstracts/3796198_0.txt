The acetyltransferase activity of neutrophils from patients with inflammatory disorders was assayed using the homogenate preparation of neutrophils. The enzyme activity was evaluated on both non-stimulated and stimulated neutrophils. The enzyme activity of neutrophils from 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 10 patients with Behcet's disease was not significantly different from that of the control group. In contrast, it was significantly elevated in patients with bacterial infection, especially that of non-stimulated cells. The increase in the enzyme activity best correlated with the degree of fever. The elevated enzyme activity tended to normalize during convalescence.
