Serum activity of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was investigated in 32 patients with sarcoidosis, 22 patients with Behçet's disease, 22 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's (VKH) disease and 253 healthy controls. In healthy controls, the ADA level was significantly higher in females than in males (p < 0.01). In patients with sarcoidosis, the serum ADA level was significantly higher in both males and females than in the controls (p < 0.01). In patients with Behçet's disease, the serum ADA level was significantly higher than in the controls (p < 0.01) in males only. In VKH disease, the serum ADA level showed no significant difference from the normal controls. Significant elevation of the serum ACE activity was observed only in patients with sarcoidosis (p < 0.01). Serum ACE activity was therefore considered to be more specific to sarcoidosis than serum ADA activity.
