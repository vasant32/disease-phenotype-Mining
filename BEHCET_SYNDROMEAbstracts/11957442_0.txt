A 27-year-old Kosovo-Albanian woman with recurrent oral and genital ulcerations, arthralgias, erythema nodosum, and eye symptoms, was admitted for dyspareunia. Objective findings met the diagnostic criteria for Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS). An unexpected narrow fibrotic ring was found in the vagina. Two incisions were made and the diameter was normalised. She was treated with prednisolone and Imuran, with good symptom relief. BS might be a differential diagnostic hint when inexplicable vaginal stenosis occurs.
