Neurological involvement in a series of patients with Beh√ßet's disease, evaluated at the Departments of Neurology and Dermatology, St. Maria Hospital is reported. Meningoencephalytic or encephalytic were the most common clinical forms, while headache, cerebellar and pyramidal signs were the most prevalent symptoms/signs. On follow-up (range 2-13 years) the majority of the patients had either a progressive or a remitting-progressive course. Magnetic ressonance imaging was the most valuable method of detecting central nervous system lesions.
