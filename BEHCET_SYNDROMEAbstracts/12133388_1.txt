 OBJECTIVE: To study the choroidal and retinal changes in Behcet's disease and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKHS) using indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). METHODS: Seventeen cases (27 eyes) of Behcet's disease and 18 cases (36 eyes) of VKHS were examined with FFA and ICGA. All of the patients showed an active intraocular inflammation when examined. RESULTS: FFA showed leakage from retinal vessels in patients with Behcet's disease. ICGA revealed choroidal abnormalities including dilatation and hyperpermeability of choroidal vessels in 11 eyes (40.7%). In VKHS, FFA revealed the hyperfluorescence and serous pigment epithelium detachments. Dilatation and hyperpermeability of choroidal vessels revealed by ICGA were found in 36 eyes (100%), multihypofluorescent dark dots in 32 eyes (88.9%), and choroidal filling defects in 28 eyes (77.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Although retinal vascular lesions are predominant in Behcet's disease, choroidal abnormalities evidenced by dilatation of choroidal vessels are also present in some patients. Hyperfluorescence and hypofluorescence revealed are the main findings in the patients with VKHS. A combination of FFA and ICGA is recommended for the examination of Behcet's disease and VKHS.
