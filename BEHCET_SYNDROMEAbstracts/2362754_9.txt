We reviewed the results of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in the posterior chamber following extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) in 70 cataractous eyes with various types of endogenous uveitis, predominantly acute anterior uveitis, Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis, Harada's disease, and Beh√ßet's disease. During an average of 23.1 months' follow-up (range, 13 to 48 months) there was no exacerbation of the preexisting uveitis in any of the eyes. Postoperative visual acuity in all eyes was better than it was preoperatively, although further procedures were required in some eyes: a pars plana vitrectomy in one, a surgical peripheral iridectomy in one, and Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy in 10. Our results suggest that selected uveitis patients can tolerate and benefit from an ECCE and IOL implantation.
