OBJECTIVES: This study was planned to explore the alterations of endothelial functions in the prethrombotic state of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) patients. DESIGN: Plasma levels of endothelial secretory markers, in vivo molecular haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters were cross-sectionally determined in the study group. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: In our tertiary referral centre, 30 (13 men, 17 women) BD patients, mean age 31 +/- 7 years, and 15 (eight men, seven women) healthy volunteers, mean age 26 +/- 9 years, were eligible for inclusion in the study after obtaining their written consents. INTERVENTIONS: All plasma samples for the assays of haemostatic parameters were obtained before and after an endothelial stimulant, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP). RESULTS: We have shown that in the procoagulant phase of BD patients: (1) basal thrombomodulin concentrations are increased and could not be provoked by DDAVP infusion; (2) both thromboxane B2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha increments occur concurrently; (3) in vivo coagulation markers are elevated and raised plasmin-alpha 2 antiplasmin complex indicates a subclinical concomitant fibrinolysis; (4) the fibrinolytic process is conveyed in a somewhat complex manner in which plasminogen activator binding kinetics might be also altered. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial cell injury, augmented thrombotic risk with compensatory excessive fibrinolysis and alterations in endothelial cell receptor-fibrinolytic marker relations might take place in the pathogenesis and thereby modulate the natural course of haemostatic processes of BD.
