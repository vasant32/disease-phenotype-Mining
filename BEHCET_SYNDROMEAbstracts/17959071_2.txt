 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of Behcet's disease with cardiac involvement. METHODS: Patients diagnosed as Behcet's disease with cardiac involvement in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1990 to 2006 were included in this analysis. The clinical characteristics of these patients were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included. Cardiac involvement included valvular disease, angina, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, intracardiac thrombus and pulmonary artery hypertension. The effect of valve replacement or intervention treatment was related to the activity of Behcet's disease. The involvement of pulmonary artery was an independent correlative factor of mortality (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The manifestation of cardiac involvement in Behcet's disease is various. If needed, valve replacement operation and intervention treatment should be performed when the Behcet's disease is stable. The involvement of pulmonary artery is an independent correlative factor of mortality.
