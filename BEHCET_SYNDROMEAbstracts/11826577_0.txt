INTRODUCTION: Behçet's disease is particularly frequent in the Mediterranean countries and in the Far East. Its predominance in men is the reason why its association with pregnancy has rarely been reported in the literature. OBSERVATIONS: Three pregnancies occurred in two patients with Behçet's disease. In the first case the disease was diagnosed post partum. The second pregnancy in a stabilized patient was complicated by depression and abortion at 16 weeks of amenorrhea. The second patient presented with an articular episode after delivery, requiring an increase in dose of corticosteroids. COMMENTS: The interventions between pregnancy and Behçet's disease are obscure. The progression of the disease varies from one women to another and from one pregnancy to the next in the same woman. The observations reported here add to those describing aggravation of Behçet's disease during or after pregnancy.
