Serum cholesterol concentrations among very low, low, and high density lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL and HDL) in 12 male patients with Beh√ßet's disease were compared with those of 12 normal male subjects. Serum lipoproteins were separated by a combination of ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatography. The patients had significantly (p less than 0.001) lower concentrations of HDL-cholesterol than the control subjects (356 +/- 62 mg/l vs. 573 +/- 108 mg/l, means +/- SD). The cholesterol concentrations in apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (VLDL and LDL) from the patients tended to be reciprocally higher than those of the controls, though not statistically significant. There was no difference in serum total cholesterol concentrations. The chemical composition of HDL from the patient group was characterized by higher protein and lower cholesterol (both esterified and free) contents compared with the control HDL.
