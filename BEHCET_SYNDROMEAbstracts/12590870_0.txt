Cyclosporine A (CsA) has been in clinical use for some decades, primarily for the prevention and treatment of organ transplant rejection and graft-versus-host disease. In more recent years, Cyclosporine has been recognized as beneficial in the treatment of dermatologic diseases, such as: psoriasis, lichen planus, Behcet disease, atopic dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Above all, Cyclosporine is an important therapeutic modality for several dermatologic diseases that are refractory to other agents.
