Arterial manifestations of Behcet's disease consist of aneurysm formation, stenosis and occlusion. Aneurysms in Behcet's disease most commonly involve the pulmonary arteries and have been shown to resolve with medical treatment.

We present a 43-year-old man with bilateral abdominal aortic aneurysms resulting from Behcet's disease resolving with medical therapy.
