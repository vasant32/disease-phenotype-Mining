We report a case of recurrent variant angina pectoris which occurred even while receiving antispastic treatment. Coronary angiography revealed no obvious lesion. Behçet's syndrome was diagnosed based on recurrent oral aphthous and genital ulcer as well as skin manifestation. After treatment with immunosuppressant, neither angina nor oral ulcer relapsed. We strongly believe that the variant angina is due to coronary vasospasm induced by Behçet's syndrome in this patient.
