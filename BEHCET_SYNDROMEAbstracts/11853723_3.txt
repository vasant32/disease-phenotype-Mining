 BACKGROUND: To report the ocular manifestations of neuro-Behcet's disease. CASES: A 34-year-old woman had recurrent meningitis. She developed diplopia, headache, and ataxia, and was diagnosed as having neuro-Behcet's disease. OBSERVATIONS: Imaging revealed two infarct foci in the transitional midbrain and pons. After treatment with prednisolone and colchicine, the diplopia resolved. Two years later, a scotoma developed in the right eye, in which the best-corrected visual acuity was 4/200. Papillitis and a prepapillary vitreous opacity were seen in the right fundus. These findings disappeared 11 days after subconjunctival steroid injections and increased colchicine. Her vision gradually improved to 20/20 two months later. CONCLUSION: Neuro-Behcet's disease may manifest with transient optic neuritis and prepapillary vitreous opacity.
