We present a survey of Behçet's syndrome based on three case reports and a review of the literature. Behçet's syndrome is a systemic connective tissue disease affecting arteries and veins. The basic pathological findings are vasculitis, aneurysms and thrombosis. The disease is rarely observed in Norway, but occurs rather frequently in Turkey and Japan. It affects males and females, most often in the age group 20-35 years. The main clinical manifestations are oral and genital aphthae and eye inflammation. The disease may also involve a number of other organs. Depending on the severity of the disease, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are employed.
