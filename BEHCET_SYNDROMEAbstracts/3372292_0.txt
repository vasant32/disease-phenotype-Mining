An adolescent with a history of recurrent genital ulcers had a negative evaluation for sexually transmitted diseases.

The condition may be more frequent than suspected as the signs (arthritis, mouth ulcers, neurologic abnormalities) may be so mild or separate in time that they could be easily overlooked.
