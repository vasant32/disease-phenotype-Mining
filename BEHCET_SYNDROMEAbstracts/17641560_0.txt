Behcet's disease has been recognized as a systemic vasculitis characterized by the involvement of multiple organs such as orogenital ulcers, eye lesions including uveitis and optic neuritis, and skin lesions including folliculitis and erythema nodosum. Vascular involvement occurs occasionally and is classified into thrombosis and aneurysm. However, massive gastrointestinal bleeding from arterial aneurysm is a rare manifestation of intestinal Behcet's disease. Recently, we experienced a case of intestinal Behcet's disease presenting with massive gastrointestinal bleeding due to aneurysmal rupture of ileo-colic artery. A 30-year-old male with Behcet's disease was admitted because of massive gastrointestinal bleeding. A large ileo-cecal ulcer was revealed as a bleeding focus on colonoscopic examination. Celiac angiography showed aneurysm and stenosis of ileo-colic artery. After the failure of hemostasis with arterial embolization, ileocecectomy was performed. After the resection hematochezia was completely stopped.
