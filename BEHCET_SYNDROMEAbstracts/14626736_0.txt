Behçet's disease is associated with cardiac complications which may affect all three cardiac layers in 1 to 6% of cases. Although pericardial and coronary disease are the most common, the myocardium may also be affected. The clinical presentation may be left ventricular dysfunction with signs of dilated cardiomyopathy. The cause of the left ventricular dysfunction is usually coronary artery disease but it can also be inflammatory, resulting in a myocarditis with normal coronary arteries. The authors report two cases of Behçet's disease with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction presenting as dilated cardiomyopathy with normal coronary arteries in one of the cases. Recent echocardiographic studies suggest that the incidence of myocardial disease is underestimated in this pathology: 20 to 35% of patients with Behçet's disease but no cardiac symptoms had left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. A more attentive investigation of left ventricular diastolic function in these patients should enable earlier diagnosis of this complication.
