Excessive Th1 cell function is importantly involved in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease (BD). We previously found that Txk, a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, acts as a Th1 cell specific transcription factor. To investigate immune aberration in the pathogenesis of BD, we studied the expression of Txk and Th1 cytokines in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and skin lesions in patients with BD. Cytokine production by the lymphocytes was assessed using ELISA. PBL produced excessive Th1 associated cytokines including IFN-gamma and IL-12 spontaneously and in response to exogenous HSP60-derived peptide stimulation, which was shown to induce proliferation of PBL, in patients with BD. Circulating CD4+ T cells expressed excessive Txk protein. A majority of cells infiltrating into skin lesions expressed IFN-gamma in the BD specimens. IL-12 and IL-18 were also expressed in the mononuclear cell aggregates. Lymphocytes accumulating in the skin lesion expressed higher levels of Txk as compared with atopic dermatitis lesions, a typical Th2 disease. IFN-gamma, IL-18 and Il-12 were detected in the BD skin lesions, which may induce preferential development of Th1 cells in patients with BD. The mononuclear cell aggregates contained Txk expressing cells in such skin lesions. Collectively, Txk expressing Th1 cells and the Th1 associated cytokines may play a critical role in the development of skin lesions in BD.
