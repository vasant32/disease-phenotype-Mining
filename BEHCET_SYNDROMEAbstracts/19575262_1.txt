The mechanism for vascular involvement of Beh√ßet disease (BD) includes arterial and venous thrombosis. Although the exact etiology of systemic vasculitis and thrombosis is still unknown, many hypotheses have been suggested. One of these hypotheses is that hyperhomocysteinemia causes vascular disease and thrombosis. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of homocysteine, vitamin B(12), and folic acid of BD patients with those of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) patients and healthy controls. Forty-five BD patients, 47 RAS patients, and 69 healty control subjects were included in this study. Vitamin B(12), folic acid, and homocysteine levels of the patients and controls were measured, and statistical differences among the groups were determined. BD patients had mostly cutaneous symptoms. Arthritis and ocular and vascular involvement were seen in 24.4%, 22%, and 11% of BD patients, respectively. No significant difference was detected among the groups in the levels of vitamin B(12), folic acid, and homocysteine. There was no significant difference in any parameters according to sex and age of the patients and activity of BD and if the patients with BD were treated or not. Homocysteine level inversely correlated with vitamin B(12) and folic acid levels in the BD group. We could not find any differences in homocysteine, vitamin B(12), and folic acid levels between BD and RAS patients and controls. This may be due to the fact that our patients mostly had cutaneous symptoms rather than vascular involvement.
