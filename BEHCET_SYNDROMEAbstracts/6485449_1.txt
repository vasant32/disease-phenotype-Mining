HLA-pattern was analysed in 60 patients with recurrent benign aphthosis (RBA), in another 14 suffering from Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and in 200 healthy individuals, all of German origin. High prevalence rates of HLA-A2, HLA-B5 and HLA-Cw3 haplotypes were found in patients with RBA, yet significant only for HLA-Cw3 (p = 0.01). HLA-B5 was shown in none but two German patients with BD. These results are discussed with particular regard to reports on racial differences of HLA-patterns in the populations of several continents including patients with aphthous disorders.
