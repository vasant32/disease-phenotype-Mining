A 59-year-old woman with Beh√ßet's disease was admitted because of hemoptysis. She had undergone resection and patch closure of a thoracic descending aortic aneurysm 6 years before this current admission. The aortography after the first operation had shown a pseudoaneurysm at the operative site. In the current operation, we performed thromboexclusion with a temporary occlusion balloon in the distal thoracic descending aorta above Adamkiewicz. The post operative course was uneventful. Postoperative angiography demonstrated exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm and the patient was discharged without recurrent hemoptysis.
