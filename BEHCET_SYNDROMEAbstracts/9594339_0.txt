OBJECTIVE: To study the manifestations of Behcet's disease (BD) in the digestive tract and its differential diagnosis from common inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS: The symptoms and endoscopic, X-ray's or surgical characteristics of 24 cases of Behcet's disease with digestive tract manifestations were analysed. RESULTS: The lesions mainly occurred in tileocecum, and frequently led to hemorrhage that required surgery. The recurrent rate was as high as 77.7%. CONCLUSION: Importance should be attached to early diagnosis of BD of the digestive tract to prevent serious complications.
