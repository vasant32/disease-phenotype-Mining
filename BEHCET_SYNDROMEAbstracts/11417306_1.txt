Approximately 50% of patients with scleritis are known to be associated with systemic connective tissue diseases or vasculitic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Wegener's granulomatosis, relapsing polychondritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The patients with scleritis in association with Behcet's disease (BD) have been rarely described in the literature. We report a 46-year-old female patient with BD who developed the nodular scleritis.
