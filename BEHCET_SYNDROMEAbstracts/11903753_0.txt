Recurrent intestinal ulcer is a frequent problem in the management of Behçet's disease. However, no standard therapy for intestinal Beheçt's disease has been established. We report two patients with intestinal Behçet disease and recurrent ileal ulcers who were treated successfuly with a lipid emulsion of dexamethasone. In one patient, the cecal ulcer did not relapse after the intravenous administration initiation of a lipid emulsion of dexamethasone once a week, despite the discontinuation of prednisolone. In the other patient, the cecal ulcer showed a healing tendency, and oral administration of prednisolone was reduced from 40 to 15 mg/day after intravenous administration of a lipid emulsion of dexamethasone. Both patients experienced no complications associated with the administration of the emulsion. These results suggest that an intravenous drug delivery system using a lipid emulsion of dexamethasone is useful for treatment of intestinal Behçet's disease.
