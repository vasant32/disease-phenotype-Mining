Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disorder. Since its first description, the involvement of many organ-systems has been studied. However, the involvement of the peripheric nervous system has not been well documented yet. Twenty-six patients involved in the study were without prominent complaints of neuropathic symptoms. They were surveyed through the outpatient clinic of the department of dermatology. Each patient filled out a total neuropathy score (TNS) questionnaire after their neurologic exam. A neurology specialist conducted the electrophysiological study. Our results were noteworthy because this complication was present without significant complaint. We hypothesized that the nerve dysfunction or peripheral neuropathy of BD is an axonal type of distal polyneuropathy and predominantly involves the lower extremities. We did not find a predominant motor or sensory nerve involvement. This complication is mentioned and reported rarely in BD.
