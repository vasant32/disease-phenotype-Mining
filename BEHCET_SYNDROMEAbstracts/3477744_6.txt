A 48-year-old man with a 27-year history of debilitating recurrent aphthous stomatitis major and pustular skin lesions was treated successfully with thalidomide. Side effects have not been encountered during a 6-month symptom-free period, while he has taken 25 mg per day. The drug is currently unavailable in this country except for the treatment of leprosy. It is hoped that publication of the dramatic response to thalidomide in this one instance will encourage greater interest in this potentially useful drug.
