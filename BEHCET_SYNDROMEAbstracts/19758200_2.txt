The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the frequency of HLA-B27 and HLA-B51 in healthy subjects from the center of Tunisia and to investigate their usefulness in the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Beh√ßet's disease (BD), respectively. Microlymphocytotoxicity test was used to perform serologic HLA typing in a group of 124 healthy volunteers and a group of 365 patients suffering from clinical manifestations of AS and/or BD. HLA-B27 was found in 3.2% of healthy subjects and in 42.9% of patients with AS (P < 0.00006). HLA-B51 is, however, found in 16.1% of healthy subjects and in 30.0% of patients with BD (P > 0.05). Unlike HLA-B51, which seems to be as frequent in Tunisian patients with BD as in healthy subjects, HLA-B27 is more frequent in patients with AS than in controls. This highlights the usefulness of HLA-B27, rather than that of HLA-B51, in the diagnosis of the respective diseases.
