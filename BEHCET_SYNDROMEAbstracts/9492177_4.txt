The production of IgA protease in twelve strains of Streptococcus sanguis isolated from patients with Behcet's disease (BD) was examined. Protease activity was detected in 10 out of 12 strains. The protease was purified from one representative strain, S. sanguis 113-20, by employing Rotofor and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified protease was approximately 100 kDa, and it cleaved the proline-threonine site of the IgA. Both IgG and IgA titers against the cells (113-20) and the purified IgA protease in the sera of BD patients and healthy controls, 36 each, were assayed. The IgG titers against the cells and protease were not significant in the BD patients or controls, but the IgA titers against the cells and protease in the BD patients were significantly higher than those of the controls. These data indicate that the BD patients are infected with IgA protease-producing S. sanguis strains, which cause an increase of IgA titer against these organisms and IgA protease antigen. Since the organisms can proliferate in BD patients for a long period of time (years), it seems that IgA antibodies cannot effectively eliminate the organisms.
