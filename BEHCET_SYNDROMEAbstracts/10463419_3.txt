PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the status of the retina and the choroid, and to evaluate blood flow velocity in the central retinal (CRA) and ophthalmic artery in Behçet's disease. METHODS: Digital fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography were performed in 53 eyes and color Doppler ultrasonography in 61 eyes of 31 Behçet patients, between December 1993-January 1996. RESULTS: Fluorescein angiography revealed no vascular leakage in 7, and diffuse retinal and/or disc leakage due to vasculitis in 46 eyes. ICG angiography was normal in 14 eyes while it revealed hypo or hyperfluorescence in the remaining. For the CRA, peak systolic and end diastolic velocities were significantly lower in Behçet patients than in control cases. In the Behçet group, Doppler indices did not differ significantly in eyes which had choroidal abnormalities and those that did not, according to ICG angiography. CONCLUSION: In Behçet's disease, some abnormalities in the choroid may be seen. The disease appears to be associated with decreased mean flow velocities in CRA.
