The clinical response to levamisole in 11 patients with complete Behcet's syndrome was reviewed. Nine patients responded, 3 completely and 6 partially, with reduction in the number and severity of buccal and genital lesions. In 3 patients each, ocular inflammation and gastrointestinal involvement responded to levamisole, and in 1 patient neurologic status improved. Levamisole was purposely discontinued in 3 patients to assess its true role in disease control. Each patient experienced a flare. Reintroduction of therapy controlled the flare in all cases, although 1 patient subsequently relapsed while continuing therapy. Two patients failed to respond. Side effects necessitated permanent discontinuation of the drug in 2 respondent patients, but in no case did neutropenia or agranulocytosis develop. These preliminary results suggest that levamisole may be useful in the therapy of the various manifestations of Behcet's syndrome and that a controlled prospective study is indicated.
