It is of general belief that males are prone to more frequent, more severe manifestations, and less favorable outcome. We evaluated this hypothesis in ophthalmological manifestations (OM) of Behcet's Disease (BD). Visual acuity (VA), anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis (PU), and retinal vasculitis (RV) were checked, according to Ben Ezra, in 1,515 patients with eye lesions. The data at baseline and last visit were compared. Male/female ratio was 1.2 in the BD registry (6,500 patients) and 1.51 for OM patients (Chi(2) = 98.962, p < 0.0001). The patients-year-follow-up was 4,987. All parameters improved significantly from the baseline. Mean VA improved from 4.87 to 5.35 for males (p < 0.0001) and from 5.20 to 5.74 for females (p < 0.0001). Difference between males/females at baseline was not significant (p = 0.60). The mean improvement for males/females was statistically non-significant (p = 0.58). Percent improvement of eyes for males/females was 47.1%/48.8% (p = 0.41). Mean PU improved from 1.83 to 0.71 for males (p < 0.0001) and from 1.66 to 0.49 for females (p < 0.0001). Difference between males/females at baseline was significant (p = 0.01). The mean improvement for males/females was statistically non-significant (p = 0.45). Percent improvement of eyes for males/females was 75.4%/81.0% (p = 0.004). Mean RV improved from 2.05 to 1.16 for males (p < 0.0001) and from 1.97 to 0.99 for females (p < 0.0001). Difference between males/females at baseline was not significant (p = 0.42). The mean improvement for males/females was statistically non-significant (p = 0.47). Percent improvement of eyes for males/females was 62%/64.4% (p = 0.33). Male gender is more prone to ocular manifestations. The severity of lesions at baseline was the same for VA and RV. For PU, the difference was statistically significant, but was not clinically relevant. The therapeutic outcome (mean improvement and percent of improved eyes) was the same for all parameters.
