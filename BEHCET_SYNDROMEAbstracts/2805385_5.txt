We describe six cases of Behcet's disease, which showed Sweet's syndrome-like features. The clinical findings in our patients closely resemble those of the cases described in previous reports on Sweet's syndrome. However, oral and genital mucosal involvement, non-tenderness of the lesions and a pustular eruption elsewhere made us consider Beh√ßet's disease. Besides the clinical findings, vasculitis was clearly demonstrated in the skin biopsy specimens.
