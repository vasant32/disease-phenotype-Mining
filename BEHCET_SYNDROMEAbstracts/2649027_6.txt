Serial studies of leucocyte migration in vivo were carried out in 15 patients with Behçet's syndrome using a skin window technique. Where possible, patients with and without active disease were studied during and in the absence of treatment. In patients with active disease neutrophil migration was frequently greater than normal, particularly with respect to numbers of cells migrating. There was also an increased frequency of emigrating neutrophils with less or more nuclear lobes than normal. In three patients in whom function of skin window neutrophils was studied nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and phagocytosis and killing of Candida guilliermondiae were normal. The monocyte component of the skin window was more often reduced in patients than in normal controls. Corticosteroid treatment did not exert a major effect on leucocyte migration, though the doses involved were relatively small. Neutrophil abnormalities were common in patients and particularly those with active disease. These results suggest that neutrophil hyperactivity may have an important role in the pathogenesis of Behçet's syndrome.
