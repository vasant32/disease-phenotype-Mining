 OBJECTIVE: The strength-duration time constant (SDTC) is a measure of axonal excitability and it can provide information about Na(+) channel function. In this study, we sought to examine the changes in the SDTCs of motor and sensory fibers of the median nerve in patients taking colchicine, which affects axoplasmic flow and may result in axonal neuropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: The SDTCs of motor and sensory fibers of 29 patients who had been taking colchicine were measured following stimulation of the right median nerve at the wrist. The results were compared with ten healthy age-matched subjects. No significant differences were found between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of any effect on the SDTC by colchicine might have been due to the fact that axonal degeneration caused by colchicine affects the Na(+)-K(+) ATP pump or that it affects internodal channels other than nodal channels.
