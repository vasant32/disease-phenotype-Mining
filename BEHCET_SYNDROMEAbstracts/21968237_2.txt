 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical response after switching from infliximab to adalimumab in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: In this ongoing, prospective, longitudinal and observational study, data were collected on efficacy and safety of every patient with BD beginning anti-TNF therapy in the last 8 years. The present analysis was restricted to patients who were switched to adalimumab after failing or not tolerating infliximab. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients with BD have been treated with infliximab so far. Seventeen of these (25%) have been switched to adalimumab for lack or loss of efficacy or infusion reactions. In 10 out of these 17, the main manifestations requiring switching were the mucocutaneous lesions, in 4 retinal vasculitis and in 3 the neurological involvement. Of the 17 treated patients, 9 showed sustained remission of the disease and 3 a good response. No side effects were observed in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that patients with BD showing a scarce response or adverse events to infliximab may successfully be treated with adalimumab, regardless of the reason for switching.
