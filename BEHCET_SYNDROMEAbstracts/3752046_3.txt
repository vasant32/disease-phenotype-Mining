A 20-yr-old Japanese man with longstanding Behçet's disease had pyloric stenosis and multiple duodenal ulcers. The pyloric stenosis was due to edematous hypertrophy of the pyloric ring and was unrelated to duodenal ulceration. The evidence suggests that the pyloric stenosis and multiple duodenal ulceration were a manifestation of Behçet's syndrome and not merely incidental peptic ulcer disease.
