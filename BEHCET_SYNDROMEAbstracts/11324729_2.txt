BACKGROUND: When examined macroscopically and histologically, there are no differences between "simple" intestinal ulcers and intestinal ulcers of Behçet's disease. The postoperative recurrence of intestinal Behçet's disease and simple ulcers was frequently. Medical treatment for postoperative recurrent ulcers is palliative, and the patient often requires surgery. We studied about an effect of absolute ethanol spraying via endoscopy for the ulcers. METHOD: The postoperative rate of recurrence was 56% (9/16). Commonly the ulcer recurred around the anastomotic region. We performed spraying for recurrent ulcers with absolute ethanol via endoscope in four patients. RESULTS: This therapy was effective for the recurrent ulcer in the 4 patients. In this study, the patients who were monitored and treated by the spraying of ethanol did not require further surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This therapy should performed for recurrent ulceration in cases of simple ulcer and intestinal Behçet's disease.
