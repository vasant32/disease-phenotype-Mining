In Moroccan patients, predisposition to Beh√ßet's disease is associated with HLA-B*51, mostly in males with young age at disease onset. In addition, the disease is associated with B*15 both in females and in males with late disease onset. We analyzed the clinical presentation, the severity and the course of the disease in 86 Moroccan patients according to their HLA-B phenotype. The presence of the B*51 or B*15 did not predispose to a particular clinical manifestation, nor to a more severe presentation of the disease. By contrast, outcome of the disease significantly differed depending on HLA-B phenotype, with an increase of symptoms in most B*51+ patients and in half of B*15 patients, and a remission or a decrease of symptoms in all B*51-B*15- patients. This variable course was mostly observed for ocular lesions, skin lesions, articular symptoms, and neurological symptoms. These data may suggest that treatment should be given early in the course of the disease in B*51 or B*15-positive patients in order to stabilize the inflammatory process.
