Assessment of Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) activity in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Myasthenia gravis (MG), Behçet's disease and neuro-Behçet, as well as in normal controls were carried out in order to determine its role in the pathogenesis of neurologic disorders. LTC4 levels were found to be elevated in MS and Behçet patient in comparison with controls. Augmentation of LTC4 levels underlines the fact that leukotrienes may be held responsible the pathogenesis of these disorders.
