We report a 39-yr-old man with neuro-Beh√ßet's disease (NBD) in remission who developed left-sided ataxia with a sensory deficit about 10 days after tooth extraction. Several years ago, he experienced a similar episode of relapse after tooth extraction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a newly developed right thalamic lesion. In cerebrospinal fluid, lymphocyte-dominant pleocytosis and mild elevation of IgG were found. Immunologic factors may be important in the pathogenesis of NBD because of the time delay between tooth extraction and relapse. Careful observation and prevention are needed before dental procedures in patients with NBD.
