Following a total hip prosthesis, a 52-year-old Turkish man with Behçet's disease developed persistent ileus due to intestinal perforations. Resection of the intestine was followed by new perforations, resulting in resection of another portion of the intestine and the start of immunosuppressive medication. Following the 5th resection for a perforated ulcer in the space of two weeks, an ileostomy was performed. One year later the stoma could be eliminated and the patient remained symptom-free. Behçet's disease is relatively rare in the Netherlands. However, the gastrointestinal complications may be life-threatening. Surgical intervention is then often necessary. Complications and recurrences are frequent.
