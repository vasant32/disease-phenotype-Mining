Among Han nationality Chinese and living in the northern area of the Yellow River, 120 patients suffering from Beh√ßet's disease and 100 unrelated healthy individuals were typed for histocompatibility antigens (HLA)-A, -B, -C, and -DR and -DQ antigens. HLA-DR and DQ typing was performed on B-lymphocyte separated with Lympho-B-Kwik. The HLA-antisera were provided by 11th IHWC. Bf alleles and C4 allotypes were determined by immunofixation agarose-gel electrophoresis. HLA-B51 was found in 67/120 (55.83%) patients and in 12/100 (12%) controls, the Chi-square and relative risk values were 45.54 and 9.27, respectively (p < 0.0005). C4AQ0 frequency was significantly increased in the patient group. In the complete form group HLA-B51 was observed more frequently (62.79%). No significant differences of other HLA antigens, frequencies, Bf or B4 alleles were found between the groups.
