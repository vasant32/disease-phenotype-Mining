We report on a 6 yr 7 m-old girl who had suffered from recurrent oral ulcers since July, 2000. Anal ulcers were also noted initially, and arthralgia was observed. Skin testing (pathergy test) showed only mild erythematous changes over the test area. HLA typing revealed HLA-B56. Intestinal symptoms included watery diarrhea with occasional blood. No ocular involvement was found. Her ailment was diagnosed as incomplete Behçet's disease with intestinal involvement. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease in childhood is a challenge and there are only a few studies on juvenile Behçet's disease (JBD) in the literature, with only a small number of patients. According to the literature, Behçet's disease in childhood is characterized by a low incidence of ocular lesion and a high incidence of intestinal involvement, as exhibited in this case.
