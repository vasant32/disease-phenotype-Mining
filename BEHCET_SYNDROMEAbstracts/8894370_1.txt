Behçet's disease is a multisystem disorder affecting the skin, mucous membranes, eye, joints, central nervous system, and blood vessels. One of the known vascular complications of Behçet's disease is venous thrombosis or aneurysm formation. We report, herewith, a patient with Behçet's disease who developed radial artery aneurysm, deep venous thrombosis, and bilateral central retinal vein thrombosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bilateral central retinal vein thrombosis in association with Behçet's disease.
