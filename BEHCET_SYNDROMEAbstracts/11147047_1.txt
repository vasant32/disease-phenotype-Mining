BACKGROUND: Even in patients with Behçet's disease, disease, the development of severe aphthosis should suggest the possibility of a drug reaction. CASE REPORT: We observed a case of giant lingual aphthosis that developed four months after adding microrandil to the regimen of a patient with Behçet's disease who had been treated with colchicine for 16 years. The aphthosis healed after withdrawal of nicorandil. DISCUSSION: There have been 21 cases of nicorandil-induced buccal aphthosis reported in the literature. All healed at drug withdrawal. He delay between initiation of treatment of the stomatitis in most patients, the development of the aphthosis after increasing he nicorandil dose in two patients, its regression after reducing the dose in one and pathology date from biopsied cases suggest a dose-dependent toxic mechanism rather than an immunoallergic process is involved. To our knowledge, our case is the first reported with Behçet's disease. In our opinion, nicorandil should not be given to patients with Behçet's disease.
