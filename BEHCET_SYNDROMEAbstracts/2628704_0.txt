Serum IgA, IgC, IgM and secretory IgA levels in patients with Behçet disease were examined. Among them, serum IgA and secretory IgA levels, which increase in mucosal inflammation, were significantly higher than controls (p less than 0.001, p greater than 0.01). These results indicate that mucosal inflammation, oral and gastrointestinal inflammation, may lead to gram-negative bacterial infection and endotoxin-induced uveitis in patients with Behçet disease.
