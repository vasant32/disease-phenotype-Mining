 PURPOSE: To quantitatively evaluate aqueous flare and cells in patients with Behcet's disease. METHODS: This study included 30 Behcet's patients (52 eyes) with active uveitis. The patients were treated with immunosuppressive agents. Aqueous flare and cells were quantified using the laser flare-cell photometry before treatment and 1 and 2 months after treatment. RESULT: Before treatment, mean aqueous flare (ph/ms) in Behcet's eyes was 25.7 ± 20.5. After treatment, flare values were significantly reduced after 1 and 2 months compared with those before treatment. No significant difference was found between flare values after 1 and 2 months. Before treatment, mean cell counts (cells/0.5 mm(3)) in Behcet's eyes were 23.2 ± 29.4. After treatment, cell counts were also significantly reduced after 1 and 2 months compared with those before treatment. Cell counts were further significantly reduced from 1 to 2 months. CONCLUSION: Both aqueous flare and cells were significantly increased in Behcet's patients with active uveitis and improved after a two-month treatment. Breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier lasts longer than aqueous cells in these patients.
