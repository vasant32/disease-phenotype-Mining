A patient with Behçet's disease who had pulmonary and cardiac involvement is described. The cardiac lesion was endocarditis in the right ventricle and a thrombus on this lesion which caused pulmonary emboli. The thrombus was excised completely and hemoptysis stopped. Pulmonary defects shown by pulmonary scintigraphy did not disappear with the therapies given to the patient. These abnormalities in Behçet's disease are very rare, echocardiographic examination can be useful in detecting them.
