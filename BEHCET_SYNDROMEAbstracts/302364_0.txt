The secondary rise of i.o. pressure in uveitis may lead to a true secondary glaucoma or to hypertensive uveitis. The etiology of the endogenous inflammation does not seem to play a role. Pathogenetically the occlusion of the pupil with the formation of iris bomb√© and the obliteration of the chamber angle by exudate are important factors, while the hypersecretion of aqueous humor plays a minor role. Medical treatment consists in mydriatics and steroids. Surgical treatment depends on the pathogenetic mechanism and consists either in sector iridectomy or a filtering procedure.
