There has recently been growing evidence supporting the importance of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Beh√ßet's disease (BD). In this study, we aim to evaluate total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidative stress (TOS) in BD patients, and compare their results both with controls that had recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) and healthy controls. TAS statistically decreased in RAS patients, and TOS levels increased in BD and RAS patients than those in healthy controls. The serum levels of Cu significantly increased only in BD patients when compared with healthy controls. Fe levels were not statistically different among the BD patients, RAS patients and healthy controls, but there was a positive correlation between TOS and plasma Fe levels in BD patients. Our results suggest that there is an insufficient antioxidant system and increased oxidative status both in BD and RAS patients. The antioxidant supplementations in addition to medical treatments will improve the quality of life.
