OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of acneiform skin lesions (comedones, papules, and pustules) in patients with BehÃ§et's syndrome (BS) with arthritis. METHODS: Study groups included 44 patients with BS with arthritis (32 men, 12 women, mean (SD) age 37.8 (8.9)), 42 patients with BS without arthritis (31 men, 11 women, mean age 35.5 (6.4)), 21 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (five men, 16 women, mean age 48.8 (14)), and 33 healthy volunteers (28 men, five women, mean age 40.1 (8.1)). All probands and controls were examined by a rheumatologist and a dermatologist, in a prospective and masked protocol. An ophthalmological evaluation was performed if necessary. Skin lesions, including comedones, papules, and pustules, were counted and scored as 0: absent, 1: 1-5, 2: 6-10, 3: 11-15, 4: 16-20, and 5: >20. RESULTS: Although there was no significant difference between the four groups in the prevalence of comedones, the number of papules and pustules was significantly higher in patients with BS with arthritis (p=0.0037 for papules and p<0.0001 for pustules) than in the remaining three groups. CONCLUSION: Acneiform skin lesions (papules and pustules) seem to be more frequent in patients with BS with arthritis. This suggest that the arthritis seen in BS may possibly be related to acne associated arthritis.
