 PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of bevacizumab on cystoid macular edema in Behçet disease. METHODS: Twelve eyes of 11 patients with Behçet disease underwent optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and visual acuity measurement before and after the intravitreal injection of Avastin to evaluate its effect. RESULTS: The visual acuity improved in 7 eyes. Foveal thickness and macular volume did not show statistically significant differences. Fluorescein angiography reduced in grading in 4 patients and was deteriorated in 2. CONCLUSIONS: The intravitreal injection of Avastin could be effective in the improvement of the vision in patients with uveitis secondary to Behçet disease.
