The purpose of this study was to compare the pulmonary functions in female Behcet's patients with or without pathological pulmonary lesions using high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT). Twenty-nine female patients aged 19-54 yrs and 20 healthy females aged 19-50 yrs (control group) were accepted into the study. HRCT images were taken and according to HRCT patients were divided into HRCT (+) and HRCT (-) groups (18 patients in each). Pulmonary function tests (PFT) through a spirometer were performed and FVC, FEV(1), FEF(25-75%), PEF, VC, RV, FRC, DLCO and DLCO/VA were determined. No statistically significant difference was observed when the PFT values were compared between HRCT (+) and HRCT (-) patients for the obtained results and the percentage of the expected values. When the PFT values were compared for both HRCT (+) and HRCT (-) patients with the control group separately there was no statistical difference between the best values. A statistically low DLCO/VA value was observed between the percentage of the expected values. It is concluded that though there is a pulmonary restriction in Behcet's disease, this restriction has no relation to pulmonary functions. It would be useful to perform pulmonary function tests in the patients with Behcet's disease both with or without any pathological findings in HRCT for obtaining information about pulmonary functions. We suggest that even when the results of the pulmonary function tests are normal, considering some pathological changes in HRCT, HRCT investigations may be useful for following up the disease.
