Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is a rare distinct entity that usually presents as asymptomatic erythematous papules that disappear spontaneously in 1-3 weeks. However, its appearance may be polymorphic, pruritic, recurrent or even chronic as is described in this case. The histological combination of neutrophilic infiltration in and necrosis of the eccrine secretory gland epithelium is highly characteristic for NEH. It typically occurs in patients receiving chemotherapeutic drugs for malignancies, but other associations have also been reported. To our knowledge, we report the first case of NEH in a patient with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Cutaneous manifestations of BD, an inflammatory systemic disorder of unknown origin, include neutrophilic dermatoses such as Sweet's syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum, although these are unusual in BD. NEH could be another neutrophilic dermatosis related to BD. This observation suggests that NEH is not strictly related to chemotherapeutic drugs and malignancies. It appears to be a reactive dermatosis associated with other factors as well, including BD. Treatment was successful with dapsone 100 mg daily.
