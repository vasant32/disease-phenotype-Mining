 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the 2 intracellular adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-1) gene polymorphisms [thymidine/cytidine (T/C) 469 and guanosine/adenosine (G/A) 241] in Behçets disease in Lebanon. METHODS: We initiated the study in July 2003, and carried out the work in the research laboratory of Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon. We extracted the DNA by glass fiber matrix mini column. We amplified the ICAM gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and tested the PCR products for the presence of the polymorphisms using a restriction enzyme specific for each polymorphism. We analyzed the results by agarose electrophoresis. RESULTS: We demonstrated the association of only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (K469) with Behçets disease, while we could not detect the other SNP (G241A) in either controls or patients in the Lebanese population. CONCLUSION: The ICAM-1 gene polymorphism 469 T/C, but not 241 G/A, may encode risk for Behçets disease in the Lebanese population.
