Beh√ßet's disease is a chronic multisystemic disorder involving many organs and characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers and relapsing iritis. A case of BD with large vein thrombosis involving superior and inferior vena cava is presented. Large vein thrombosis in BD is not commonly developed and most commonly observed in the inferior or superior vena cava. A review of the literature emphasizes the rarity of the combined superior and inferior vena caval occlusion. Existence of extensive large vein occlusion in BD is associated with limited therapy and poor prognosis.
