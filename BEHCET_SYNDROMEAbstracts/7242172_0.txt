A case of meningoencephalitis appearing during the course of Beh√ßet's disease is reported. The electroencephalographic study revealed the presence of localized short periodical activity, a heretofore unreported observation in this disease. This type of periodical activity, characteristic of acute necrotizing encephalitis (i.e., encephalitis by herpes simplex virus), appears as well, although to a lesser extent, in certain supratentorial processes such as cerebrovascular accidents and brain tumours. The features of the periodical activity in the present case are analyzed, with emphasis on those that differentiate it from the electroencephalographic pattern described in herpetic encephalitis and that, in turn, make this type of activity close to that observed in focal supratentorial brain processes. Regarding its origin, a single case precludes any formal hypothesis.
