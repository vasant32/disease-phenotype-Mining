HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 32-year-old man developed acute right-sided sore throat, a thick voice and epistaxis. 13 years previously he had erythema nodosum, 12 and 10 year ago deep vein thrombosis. On admission he had Horner's syndrome, bulging of the gums and swelling of the paratracheal space. He had been on anticoagulation therapy with phenprocoumon since the leg vein thrombosis. INVESTIGATIONS: Computed tomography demonstrated a false aneurysm of the right internal carotid artery. 9 months later a right radial artery aneurysm occurred, which was treated surgically. An arterial cannula had previously been placed at this site for pressure monitoring. 2 months later a false aneurysm of the right femoral artery was diagnosed: it had previously been used for an intravascular intervention. As embolization to the popliteal artery occurred after sonographically controlled compression had failed and reduction of anticoagulation treatment, this aneurysm, too, was treated surgically. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Because of the tendency to aneurysm formation after arterial puncture and the history of venous thromboses the diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome was considered, confirmed by subsequently elucidated history of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and folliculitis. There were no other manifestations of the syndrome. Immunosuppressive treatment was instituted after another two aneurysm recurrences were noted in the right common femoral artery. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that the diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome may be made more difficult if its manifestation is primarily vascular with minimal mucocutaneous involvement. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent arterial aneurysms in a young person.
