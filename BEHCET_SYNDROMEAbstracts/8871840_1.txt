OBJECTIVE: To characterize the systemic manifestations and joint disease in patents with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). METHODS: The presence and features of extra-oral manifestations were determined by a rheumatologist, who examined and interviewed 64 patients, referred during 1993 to the oral medicine clinic for treatment of RAS. Controls were 65 medical staff members of a military clinic associated with the hospital. RESULTS: Based on the rheumatologist's findings and published criteria, the patients were diagnosed as suffering from RAS alone (24 patients), Reiter's syndrome (8), Beh√ßet disease (8), familial Mediterranean fever (1), or RAS with undiagnosable extra oral manifestations (23). Thirteen patients in the last group had joint disease (p < 0.01 compared to the controls), characterized by recurrent mono- or oligoarthritis/arthralgia of short duration, affecting mostly the large joints. Conjunctivitis, pustular rash, lower back pain and urethritis/cervicitis were also common in RAS patients, but only the latter was significantly more frequent in RAS patients than in controls (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that patients with RAS have an increased frequency of a palindromic type joint disease.
