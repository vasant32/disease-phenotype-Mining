Chylothorax and chylopericardium secondary to thrombosis of the superior vena cava and the innominate and subclavian veins were diagnosed in a patient with Beh√ßet's syndrome. Immunosuppressive treatment, diet, and underwater seal drainage led to a diminished volume of pleural fluid and pericardial fluid and to a diminished concentration of triglyceride in them; pleurodesis with tetracycline was then performed.
