BACKGROUND: Expression of bcl-2 protein has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of some inflammatory as well as neoplastic disorders. In this study we have investigated the presence of bcl-2 protein in active skin lesions of Behçet's disease and compared these results with normal skin samples of Behçet's disease (BD) patients and BD unrelated leukocytoclastic vasculitis. METHODS: Active skin lesions of 23 Behçet's disease patients, normal skin samples of seven Behçet's disease patients, and archival biopsy specimens of 23 cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis were investigated for the presence of bcl-2 protein by immunohistochemical methods. Results of staining were assessed semiquantitatively. Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Expression of bcl-2 protein were demonstrated in 16 of 23 (69.5%) and 8 of 23 (34.7%) patients with Behçet's disease and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, respectively. There were statistically significant difference between two groups (x2 = 4.27, P < 0.05). None of the normal skin samples of Behçet's disease patients showed bcl-2 expression. CONCLUSION: Expression of bcl-2 protein may play a particular role in the development of skin lesions in Behçet's disease by causing prolonged survival of infiltrating lymphocytes.
