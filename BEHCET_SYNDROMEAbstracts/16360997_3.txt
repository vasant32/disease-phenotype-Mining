Coronary artery aneurysm is a rare coronary abnormality nearly half of which originates from atherosclerotic lesions. The major causes of non-atherosclerotic coronary aneurysms include coronary ectasia, Kawasaki disease, Takayasu aortitis, thoracic trauma and complicated angioplasty; however, it has been rarely reported associated with Behcet's disease.
