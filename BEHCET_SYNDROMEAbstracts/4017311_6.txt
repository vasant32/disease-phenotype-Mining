The effects of patient's sex and age at onset on the pathergy reaction (cutaneous hypersensitivity to a needle prick) and its correlation with disease activity in Behcet's syndrome was investigated by two independent observers in a blind protocol. Among 92 male patients the pathergy reaction was more strongly positive (p less than 0.025) than among 67 female patients of similar age and disease duration. The age at onset did not affect the severity of the pathergy reaction, although, the early onset females (age at onset 24 years or less) had the lowest prevalence of pathergy positivity (52%), compared to early onset males and late onset (age at onset 25 years or more) males and females (73-75%). As previously reported the disease was more severe among males and among those with early onset of either gender. On the other hand, no correlation between the strength of the pathergy reaction and clinical severity could be discerned.
