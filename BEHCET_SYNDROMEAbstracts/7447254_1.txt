35 cases of Behçet disease are presented including 16 vascular manifestations: 14 veinous thrombosis with 9 vena cava obstruction; 1 femoral aneurysm; 2 pulmonar arteries thrombosis; 3 pericarditis; 2 myocardial infarction. In all these cases corticosteroids and anti-coagulation therapy were instituted. With a follow-up from 5 to 36 months, only 5 relapsed in the five first months of therapy. The authors suggest systematic anticoagulation or anti-agregant therapy in Behçet disease.
