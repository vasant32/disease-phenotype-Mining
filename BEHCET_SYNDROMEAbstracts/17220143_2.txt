 OBJECTIVE: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is an immunoin-flammatory vasculitis with an unknown etiopathogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a cytokine-stimulating angiogenesis. It has been suggested to play a role in inflammation and pathogenesis of vasculitic processes. STUDY DESIGN: VEGF and CD34 expressions were assessed in samples taken from oral aphthous lesions. The patients were evaluated for disease activity, duration of lesions, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included. Fourteen (53.9%) had increased CRP levels and 12 (46.1%) had increased ESR levels. Positive VEGF and CD34 staining were detected in 46.2% and 69.2% of biopsy samples, respectively. There was good positive correlation between them. The frequency of positive VEGF and CD34 staining was statistically higher in lesions with a duration of more than 6 days. No correlation was found between positive VEGF staining and serum CRP level, ESR and disease activity. CONCLUSION: Increased VEGF expression in correlation with CD34 positivity in oral aphthous lesions may show the role of VEGF in pathogenesis of these vasculitic lesions. We have concluded that VEGF may play a role during the course of oral aphthous lesions in BD.
