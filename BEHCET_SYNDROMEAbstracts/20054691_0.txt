We describe a flare of Behçet's syndrome in a 42-year-old man who presented with florid mucocutaneous manifestations, headache and vomiting, but without meningeal or neurologic signs. A single, non-enhancing cortical lesion was found in the frontal lobe by computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies. Diffusion-weighted analysis and MR spectroscopy were consistent with focal inflammation. The patient improved with colchicine, and after 5 months, a repeat MR scan demonstrated resolution of the inflammatory changes suggesting that involvement of the cerebral cortex may be a self-limiting phenomenon, distinct from other more frequent and destructive parenchymal manifestations of neuro-Behçet's disease.
