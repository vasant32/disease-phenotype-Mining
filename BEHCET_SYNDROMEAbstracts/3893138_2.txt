Mizoribine, an immunosuppressive agent developed and marketed in Japan, was tested in experimental keratoplasty and in Behçet's disease. The drug, 2 to 4 mg/kg of body weight, administered systemically or as 10% eyedrops five times daily, suppressed immune reaction after keratoplasty in rabbits. It seemed effective in 18 cases including 12 regrafted eyes. In 29 cases of Behçet's disease, the average recurrence rate dropped from once per month to once every three months in one year. Mizoribine is safe, easy to use, and may be of some value by itself or in combination with other drugs in the treatment of uveitis and in the prevention of corneal graft reaction.
