HL-A antigens of 35 patients with Beh√ßet's disease and 36 normal Japanese were determined by a standard microlymphocytotoxicity test. The frequency of HL-A5 among patients was significantly higher than the controls. No significant differences were observed in the distribution of other HL-A antigens.
