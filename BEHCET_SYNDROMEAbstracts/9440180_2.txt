OBJECTIVE: To describe the fundus findings in Behcet's Disease with emphasis on characteristic small white patches of retinitis. METHODS: Case study, utilizing review of clinical charts and fundus photographic files. RESULTS: Search of the University of California San Francisco ophthalmic photography files revealed 6 patients coded as Behcet's Disease between 1989 and 1996. Examination of the patients and their clinical records indicated that all 6 met the International Diagnostic Criteria for Behcet's Disease. The single most common fundus finding in these cases was the presence of transient, white patches of retinitis often with a small adjacent hemorrhage. Retinal vasculitis and optic neuritis were also seen, but neither with the frequency of the white patches. CONCLUSION: The presence of small patches of retinal whitening is the most characteristic finding in Behcet's Disease. These lesions are different from cotton wool spots, and their recognition can aid in the diagnosis of Behcet's Disease and of episodes of reactivation.
