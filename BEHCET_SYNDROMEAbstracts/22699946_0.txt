The first ocular symptom in 50-87% of patients with Behçet's disease (BD) is unilateral anterior uveitis. As a characteristic sign of ocular BD the appearance of hypopyon iritis was originally described by Adamantiades and Behçet, but nowadays, probably due to an earlier and more aggressive treatment, this rarely occurs. In the further course of the disease up to 75% of BD patients develop a bilateral chronic relapsing form of posterior uveitis or panuveitis. In addition occlusive retinal vasculitis, which involves arteries as well as veins, is frequently present. A typical complication consists of a cystoid macular edema, which is, besides the retinal vasculitis, responsible for the limited prognosis of visual acuity.
