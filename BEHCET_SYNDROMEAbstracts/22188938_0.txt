 BACKGROUND: Vascular involvement in Behcet's disease is rare, but may be at the forefront of the clinical picture with possible life-threatening scenarios. We reviewed our preliminary results with endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic pathologies in Behçet's disease. METHODS: Data regarding seven patients with abdominal aortic pathologies (aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and aortoenteric fistula) and Behçet's disease were treated with endovascular stent-grafting between 2002 and 2006. RESULTS: Seven patients (aged, 39.1 ± 9; range, 27-52 years) with a mean aortic diameter of 58.4 ± 6.3 mm received endovascular stent-grafts, two patients being in emergency settings. Two patients were in active disease state. Four tube-shaped, two aorto-bi-iliac, and one aorto-uni-iliac stents were implanted. One patient expired on day 28 with multiorgan failure after emergency stent-grafting owing to enlarging periprosthetic hematoma following open surgery for ruptured aneurysm. Another patient was declined for endovascular therapy owing to hypoplastic aortoiliac vasculature. CONCLUSION: Endovascular approach provides a reasonable alternative to open repair for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms in select cases; however, in emergency settings, endovascular repair may well have an important, but limited, role in select patients with aortoenteric fistulae, it may yet require a surgical intervention.
