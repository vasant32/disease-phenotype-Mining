To evaluate the prevalence of clinical findings in Beh√ßet's disease (BD) in Chinese population. The clinical data of 170 consecutive BD patients were, retrospectively, analyzed and compared with previous reports. The mean age at onset was 34.4 years (range 6-72) and the mean age of diagnosis was 39.1 years (range 8-72). Mean delay in diagnosis was 5.7 years. The male to female ratio was 1.3:1. Recurrent aphthous ulceration (64.7%), skin lesion (18.2%), and genital ulceration (8.2%) were the commonest onset-presentations of the disease. During the disease course, the commonest presenting features were oral ulcer (100%), cutaneous involvement (68.2%), genital ulcer (63.5%), arthritis (37.1%), and ocular lesion (14.1%). As for the minor clinical manifestations, gastrointestinal lesion (10.0%), vascular lesion (8.8%), and cardiac lesion (4.7%) occurred occasionally. The pathergy skin test showed positive in 63.5% of the patients and revealed a higher positive rate in the females (76.7%) than in the males (53.6%). Less ocular lesion and genital ulcer were present in Chinese BD patients.
