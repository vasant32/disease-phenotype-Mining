Behçet disease is known to be a multisystem condition. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in patients with Behçet disease and to identify any associations between audiologic findings and other clinical manifestations and treatment. Our study group was made up of 41 adults with Behçet disease and 41 healthy sex- and age-matched controls. All patients and controls underwent a complete clinical otolaryngologic examination, which included pure-tone audiometry, acoustic impedance testing, and otoacoustic emissions testing. Audiology revealed that the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) was significantly higher in the Behçet patients than in the controls-68.3 vs. 22.0% (p < 0.002). The duration of Behçet disease had no significant impact on whether patients did or did not experience hearing loss. Hearing loss was the fourth most common clinical finding in the Behçet group, after oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and skin lesions. We conclude that SNHL is present in a significant number of Behçet patients, and we suggest the need for an adequate investigation of hearing in the routine follow-up of these patients.
