Five patients with Beh√ßet's syndrome of varying duration were treated with colchicine (500 micrograms b.i.d.). All improved clinically and one has remained clear for 1 year after cessation of therapy, although in one patient who had neurological symptoms, paraesthesiae have persisted throughout treatment.
