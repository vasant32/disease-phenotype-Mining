A 33-year-old man with a 4-year history of Behçet's disease was hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treated 99% stenosis of the right coronary artery but follow-up coronary arteriography clearly revealed a coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) at the lesion proximal to the PCI site and intravascular ultrasound confirmed that it was a true aneurysm. We speculated that Behçet's disease might be involved in coronary lesion, especially in CAA formation. We decided to increase the dose of prednisolone and to add warfarin. The size of the CAA was not altered after 6 months.
