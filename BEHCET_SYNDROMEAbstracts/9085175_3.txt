A 45-year-old man with intestinal Behçet's disease noticed an enlarged right cervical lymph node, and was diagnosed with diffuse large cell type, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The intrapelvic lymph tract was markedly deformed because of recurrent ileocecal ulceration, and conventional lymphoscintigraphy with a common tracer did not abolish the suspicion that lymphoma cells may have invaded the lymph nodes. Dynamic lymphoscintigraphy with a new tracer, 99mtechnetium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid-human serum albumin, because of its high detection sensitivity, was very useful for excluding this suspicion, and for determining the clinical stage of lymphoma. Combination induction chemotherapy led to complete remission without any adverse effects, but subsequent supportive therapy with same protocol could not be completed because of progression of the intestinal lesions. Special management for the intestinal lesions, such as bowel rest, may be essential with chemotherapy for patients with intestinal Behçet's disease.
