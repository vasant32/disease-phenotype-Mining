 PURPOSE: To determine urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) concentrations in Behcet patients with and without ocular involvement; and to investigate the associations between uPAR levels and clinical manifestations of Behcet's disease. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with Behcet's disease (31 patients with and 33 patients without ocular involvement) and 23 healthy control subjects were included in this study. A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed. Venous blood was collected from all patients and control subjects. Serum uPAR levels were determined by using human uPAR immunoassay (Quantikine) kits. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in serum uPAR levels between the patients and the control subjects (p>0.05). There were no statistically significant correlations between uPAR levels and age, gender, duration of the disease, clinical manifestations (genital ulcer, arthritis, skin lesions, ocular and vascular involvements) and activity of the disease. CONCLUSION: This finding is important since this is the first study regarding uPAR levels in Behcet's disease.
