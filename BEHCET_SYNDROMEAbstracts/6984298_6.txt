Auditory and vestibular function tests were conducted in 16 patients with Behcet's disease. Vestibular lesions included spontaneous nystagmus in 5 cases, and a bilateral vestibular syndrome after provoked tests in 13 cases (7 of the deficiency type and 6 irritative in nature). Findings after auditory tests were bilateral symmetric deafness in 2 cases; one of the perception type and the other showing mixed features. Various etiopathogenic theories are discussed. The possibility of a bilateral central lesion of the VIIIth nerve was also considered, 8 patients in the series having cerebral manifestations, particularly as the results of visual fixation tests in these cases were in favor of this hypothesis.
