 PURPOSE: To study antigen HLA class I association with different clinical forms of Behçet's disease in South Tunisian population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 129 clinical case patients. All of the patients fulfilled the criteria of the international study group for Behçet's disease, and were followed at the department of internal medicine of the university hospital of Sfax. HLA class I phenotyping was performed by microlymphocytotoxicity complement dependent for our 129 patients and for 123 healthy controls. We used the program SPSS 11.0 to analyse clinical data and to compare HLA class I antigen distribution between these two populations. RESULTS: The study group concerned a total of 129 patients (81 males and 48 females). The mean age at disease onset was of 32 years. HLA-B51 antigen was the only antigen significantly more frequent among patients (24.81%) than controls (9.76%, p=0.002). HLA-B44 was significantly more frequent among patients having familial history of recurrent buccal aphthosis or Behçet disease. HLA-A11 antigen was associated with early disease onset, and HLA-A1 was negatively associated with severe form of the disease (neurological, vascular or ocular manifestations). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the HLA-B51 association with Behçet disease. Nevertheless, B51 frequency in South Tunisian patients was lower than that found in other studies regardless of the clinical manifestation.
