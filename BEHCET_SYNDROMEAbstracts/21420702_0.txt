 INTRODUCTION: Beh√ßet's disease is a multi-system vascular-inflammatory disease with possible involvement of the central nervous system. Lesions of the corpus callosum on MRI have been rarely reported in this disease. CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old woman was admitted for a sudden right hemiplegia and confusion revealing a Behcet's disease. MRI showed a pedonculo-thalamic lesion and a white matter hypersignals, which was suggestive of the disease. Besides, involvement of the corpus callosum was observed. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that Behcet's disease should be considered among diseases with corpus callosum involvement.
