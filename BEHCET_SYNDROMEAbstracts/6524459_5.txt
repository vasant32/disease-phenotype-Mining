Six male patients out of seven with Behçet's disease were found to have a very similar and close contact with pigs and pork. These six cases are reported and we ask the question whether the contacts with pigs are just coincidental findings or whether an external agent, e.g. a virus, could be forwarded to man from pigs and pork. Immune complex associated vasculitis is described e.g. in patients with hepatitis B and the same mechanisms might be operating in patients with Behçet's disease.
