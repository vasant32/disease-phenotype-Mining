A case of Beh√ßet's disease characterized by anterior uveitis, arthritis, oral, genital, and cutaneous lesions, as well as gastrointestinal involvement, all documented over a 10-month period, is presented. Less commonly appreciated complications, such as pyoderma gangrenosum, hidradenitis suppurativa, perianal fistula, and persisting leukocytosis, were among striking clinical features of the patient's history. Remission of cutaneous lesions and no recurrence of ocular or gastrointestinal manifestations occurred with 0.6 mg oral colchicine twice daily in a period of 5 weeks.
