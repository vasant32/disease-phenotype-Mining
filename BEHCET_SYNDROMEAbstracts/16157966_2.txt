Arterial aneurysms represent a severe complication of Behcet's disease. A 42-year-old woman with Behcet's disease had a recurrence of an aneurysm after two surgical repair attempts using grafts. A covered stent-graft was implanted in her iliac external artery to occlude the neck of the aneurysm at the anastomosis of the bypass graft to her external iliac artery. The procedure reduced the size of the aneurysm by allowing the formation of a thrombus within its cavity. The implantation of an endovascular stent-graft may be a sound alternative to surgical repair for aneurysms associated with Behcet's disease.
