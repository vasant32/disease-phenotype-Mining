Four patients with palatal myoclonus were examined electromyographically. Surface EMG was recorded simultaneously from several myoclonic muscles and the correlation between their rhythmic discharges was shown. The possible existence of a remote influence of palatal myoclonus was tested by recording soleus and anterior tibial H-reflexes and seeking a correlation of their amplitudes with the rhythm of palatal myoclonus. Two cases, both with additional severe spasticity in the legs, showed rhythmic variation of the soleus H-reflex amplitude corresponding with that of their palatal myoclonus. This suggests that the neural mechanism generating the visible myoclonus has much more extensive effects.
