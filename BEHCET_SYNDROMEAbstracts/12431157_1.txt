 PURPOSE: To report the endovascular repair of dual aneurysms along a femorodistal venous bypass graft in a patient with Behçet's disease. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old man of middle European ancestry with Behçet's disease had dual aneurysms evolve along the proximal segment of a femorodistal venous bypass that had been implanted 2.5 years earlier for recurrent false aneurysm formation. Owing to the lack of suitable venous conduits and the active nature of the disease, the aneurysms were successfully excluded with overlapping Hemobahn and Jostent endografts; the immunosuppressive therapy was intensified. Rupture of the aneurysms was successfully prevented, but the stent-grafts thrombosed 6 weeks later owing to exacerbation of the underlying disease. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular exclusion of aneurysm in venous bypass grafts in Behçet's disease is feasible. Although the stent-grafts thrombosed, they did prevent rupture of the aneurysms.
