A 33-year-old woman with a three-year history of aphthous ulceration of the mouth, vaginal ulceration, and erythema nodosum, also had a subretinal neovascular membrane in the left eye.

Thus, Beh√ßet's disease must also be considered in the differential diagnosis of subretinal neovascular membrane in young patients, especially when antibodies to oral mucosa can be shown.
