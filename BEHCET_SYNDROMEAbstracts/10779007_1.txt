Behçet's syndrome is a multisystem disorder with unknown etiology. Clinically it is mostly seen as a systemic vasculitis; almost 30% of the patients have vascular involvements, and most of these are venous thrombosis and arterial aneurysms. Obstructions of the femoral and tibial arteries have also been reported in the literature. The authors present here a patient with Behçet's syndrome who had pseudoaneurysms on both femoral arteries after aortobifemoral bypass surgery.
