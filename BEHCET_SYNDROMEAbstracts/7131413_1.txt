Three patients with Behcet's disease developed arterial thromboses affecting the external iliac, middle superficial femoral, and radial arteries respectively. Arterial thrombosis occurs mainly in affected males, is predominant in the upper limbs, and usually appears several years after the onset of the disease: it is probably more frequent in the familial forms.
