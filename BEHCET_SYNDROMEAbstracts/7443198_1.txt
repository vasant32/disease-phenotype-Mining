Report of an unusual case of Behçet's disease with bilateral obliterating retinal panarteritis and ischemic optic atrophy. The rarity of the primary optic nerve involvement and chiefly the exceptional full acute bilateral occlusion of the retinal arteries are emphasized. This ophthalmoscopic picture is further clinical evidence for the major importance of the vascular involvement in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease.
