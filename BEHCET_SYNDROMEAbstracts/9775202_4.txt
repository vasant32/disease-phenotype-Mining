INTRODUCTION: Cardiac thromboses are unusual in the course of Behçet's disease and are frequently associated with endomyocardial fibrosis of the right heart. Vascular pulmonary involvement with either pulmonary aneurysm or parenchyma alterations is also often observed. However, pathogenesis of thromboses occurring in the course of Behçet's disease is still unclear. CASE REPORT: The authors report the case of a 28-year-old man who presented with Behçet's disease accompanied by pulmonary aneurysm, multiple thrombi of the right heart and antiphospholipid antibodies. CONCLUSION: The choice of therapeutical strategies for curative treatment of this association as well as the interpretation of the role of antiphospholipid antibodies in this polyvascular disease raises questions.
