The authors report the case of a 29 year old North African patient with Behçet's disease presenting with sudden thrombosis of the superior vena cava. Venous disorders are the fourth major sign of this disease. Although superficial thrombophlebitis is a common presenting sign, caval thrombosis is rare and usually occurs after several years' evolution. Superior vena caval thrombosis may be life threatening due to complications such as pulmonary embolism and haemoptysis. The anatomical substrate of this form of vascular disease is the same as that of the other visceral lesions of Behçet's disease: predominantly venous vasculitis with perivascularitis and secondary thrombosis. The pathogenesis of this thrombotic diathesis is discussed.
