Behçet's disease is a chronic relapsing multisystem vasculitis with 49% of cases involving the CNS. Recently there have been two reports of neuro-Behçet's disease (NB) successfully treated with the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) monoclonal antibody infliximab. We describe a patient with longstanding NB who was poorly responsive to azathioprine, cyclosporin, thalidomide and methotrexate. She showed a remarkable response when treated with the recombinant human TNFalpha receptor protein, etanercept. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of NB successfully treated with etanercept.
