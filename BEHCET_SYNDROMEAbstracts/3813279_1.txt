Sixty-five patients presenting with a vena cava syndrome have been examined over a 7 years period; incidence of systemic diseases as an etiologic factor has thus been studied. A systemic disease was diagnosed in 17 cases, that is 25 p. 100 of cases. This incidence is higher in inferior vena cava syndromes (15 cases out of 45). Two diseases appear as the main factors: on one hand, Behçet disease, liable for 8 vena cava thrombosis, 7 inferior and 8 superior thrombosis; on the other hand, severe disseminated erythematous lupus liable for 5 cases of inferior vena cava thrombosis. Other etiologies are mentioned such as: Churg and Strauss disease (1 case), Horton disease (1 case) and hemorrhagic rectocolitis (1 case). In the patients presenting with lupus, two died from various pulmonary embolisms; a vena cava clip was required in 3 cases. As for lupus, the immuno-hepatologic exploration did demonstrate a thrombopenia in 5 cases, an hemolytic anemia with a positive Coombs test in 2 cases, and a circulating anti-coagulant (antiprothrombinase type) in one case. Though high frequency of systemic diseases in this series may depend on the patients' recruitment, systemic lupus as well as Behçet diseases are to be researched in case of vena cava thrombosis, above all if diagnosed in a young patient and failing to be explained by a congenital abnormality of hemostasis.
