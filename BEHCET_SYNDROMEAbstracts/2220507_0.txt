The titer of serum immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) was determined by the method of single radial immunodiffusion (Matsuda et al) in Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, etiology-unknown anterior uveitis (granulomatous, non-granulomatous), allergic conjunctivitis and scleritis. The titer of IAP in these diseases except allergic conjunctivitis was significantly higher than in normal controls. In all the diseases studied, the titer during the active stage was significantly higher than that during the inactive stage. The titer in Behçet's disease was significantly higher than that in sarcoidosis, particularly during the active stage. In three cases of Behcet's disease, the titer was increased markedly a few days before the ocular attacks. There was no difference in the titer between etiology-unknown granulomatous and non-granulomatous anterior uveitis. IAP may be useful as a clinical index in inflammatory ocular diseases.
