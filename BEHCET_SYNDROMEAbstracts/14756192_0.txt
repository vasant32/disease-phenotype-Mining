The aim of this study was to evaluate microvascular assessment in patients with Behcet disease (BD) by means of an intravital videocapillaroscopic study. Sixteen BD patients were compared with an equivalent group of healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Videocapillaroscopy (VCP) was performed in peripheral areas and in conjunctiva, and morphological and quantitative parameters were assessed. In both areas VCP showed several morphological alterations (microaneurysms, megacapillaries, desertification areas) detectable in a high percentage of patients; quantitatively we found significant changes of incisuring and sludging score, of capillary loop intermediate branch length (in peripheral areas) and of arteriole/venule diameter (in conjunctiva). Therefore, vessel involvement included both the number and the whole vessel structure and was seen both in peripheral and conjunctival areas when the two different vascular beds of micro- and paramicrocirculation were examined. We conclude that an important rearrangement of microcirculation is detectable in BD and that VCP may have diagnostic and prognostic value, providing qualitative and quantitative information able to define the systemic extension of vascular damage and the degree of vessel wall alteration.
