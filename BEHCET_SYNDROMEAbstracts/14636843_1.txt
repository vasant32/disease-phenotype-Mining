 BACKGROUND: Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is believed to be involved in the progression of intraocular inflammation. We sought the source of IL-8 in the enucleated eye of the present patient. CASE: A 40-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having Beh√ßet's disease. His vision deteriorated due to persistent uveitis and secondary glaucoma. His left eye had lens-induced endophthalmitis. OBSERVATIONS: The left eye had to be enucleated, and it was investigated by an immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies for CD 1a (dendritic cells), CD 3 (T cells), CD 68 (monocytes/macrophages), interferon-gamma, or IL-8. Fibrovascular tissue had formed on and beneath the lens where inflammatory cells had infiltrated. Most of the mononuclear inflammatory cells were T cells. A large number of macrophages were observed especially around the lens. Interferon-gamma-positive cells were scattered, while IL-8 was observed only in the accumulated granulocytes, but not in either mononuclear cells or macrophages. CONCLUSION: IL-8 is thus considered to play a role in the progression of intraocular inflammation, and granulocytes are thought to be a possible source of IL-8 in endophthalmitis.
