Multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms associated with pulmonary artery thromboses and infarctions are uncommon and occur almost exclusively in Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Because of the rarity of the disease outside endemic areas, sporadic cases may go unrecognized. We report two African-American men with thoracic vascular manifestations of BD. In one patient the diagnosis of BD was made solely on the basis of the characteristic intrathoracic involvement.
