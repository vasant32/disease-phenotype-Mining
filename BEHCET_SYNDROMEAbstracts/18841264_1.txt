Behçet's disease is an autoimmune, multisystem disease presenting with recurrent oral and genital ulceration as well as ocular involvement. Aneurysmal degeneration of coronary arteries remains a rare phenomenon in Behçet's disease. The case of a patient with Behçet's disease who presented with severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery associated with a giant aneurysm of the proximal segment is described. Surgical revascularization was proposed, followed by percutaneous embolization of the aneurysm.
