Magic syndrome is a very uncommon disease, and vascular involvement is exceptional; only one case has been reported in the literature associated to a true aortic aneurysm. The treatment of aneurysms recommended in these patients is based on isolated cases and includes corticosteroids, other immunosuppressant drugs, and surgery. We report a case of a patient with Magic syndrome who developed aneurysm at the end of the aorta during treatment with infliximab, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine and who needed endovascular prosthesis implantation. After 12 months, she suffered an aneurysm of the ascending aorta, dilatation of the sinotubular junction, and severe aortic insufficiency, which forced surgery. During this time, the patient finally died.
