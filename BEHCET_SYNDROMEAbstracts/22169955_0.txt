Type and frequency of systemic and neurologic manifestations of Behçet's disease (BD) vary with ethnicity. In Brazil, BD occurs as sporadic cases. We describe clinical and radiological features of 36 Brazilian patients of mixed ethnicity with neuro-Behçet's disease (NBD). Medical records of 178 BD patients were reviewed and 36 (20%) NBD patients were identified. Twenty-one NBD patients (58.3%) were female and 27 (75%) presented with parenchymal manifestations. Brainstem involvement was the most common neurologic syndrome (41.7%). Seizures (27.8%), isolated aseptic meningitis (16.7%), optic neuropathy (ON) (16.7%), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) (8.3%), peripheral neuropathy (2.8%), and spinal cord involvement (5.6%) were other neurologic manifestations observed among Brazilian NBD patients. Eighteen (50%) had at least one relapse, and isolated aseptic meningitis was the most common relapsing manifestation. No significant differences concerning the number of relapses between parenchymal and non-parenchymal groups were found. A multivariate model including disease duration, cell count in spinal fluid, cyclosporine use, immunosuppressive use at disease onset, age at NBD onset, and ON did not reveal any significant associations with NBD relapse. There was a low frequency of CVT and an unexpected higher number of isolated aseptic meningitis. Brazilian NBD patients present more parenchymal and atypical manifestations, and relapse more often than NBD patients from other populations.
