Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing vasculitis of unknown etiology. Its association with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is extremely rare, and typical manifestations of BD were observed in a very few patients with CML, mainly under interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment. Skin pathergy test, being positive in about 50% of patients with BD, is also positive in some IFN-alpha-treated patients with CML without any evidence of BD symptoms. We describe a 62-year-old woman with CML who developed characteristic features of BD, including a positive skin hyperactivity test, during treatment with hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea has been implicated in the appearance of skin vasculitic ulceration, but this is the first case, according to our knowledge, where the development of BD was observed during hydroxyurea maintenance in the chronic phase of CML.
