Infections with Nocardia species are generally seen in immunocompromised subjects. In this report, we present a case of pleuropulmonary and skin Nocardia cyriacigeorgici infection in a male patient with Behcet's disease who used corticosteroids and immunosupressives for a long period of time. He died before the diagnosis of Nocardia infection was made.
