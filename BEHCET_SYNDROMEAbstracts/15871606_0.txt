Few reports have appeared in the literature concerning vestibular findings in Behçet's disease. In the present study, extensive vestibular testing, performed in 14 patients (8 male, 6 female; mean age: 32 years; range: 12-51) presenting definite Behçet's disease, revealed a high prevalence of central vestibular dysfunctions (78%). Data reported here suggest that an otoneurological evaluation of Behçet's disease patients may be helpful in identifying unexpected vestibular dysfunctions and central nervous system involvement different from the classical manifestations of the neuro-Behçet's syndrome.
