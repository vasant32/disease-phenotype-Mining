The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of cyclosporin in Behçet's disease. Sixteen subjects (10 males and 6 females; mean age 25.2 years) affected by the complete type of Behçet's syndrome received 5 mg/kg/day of cyclosporin for 24 months. A marked improvement of the symptoms was observed after three months of therapy. Within 6 to 12 months of treatment 14 of the 16 patients obtained a complete clinical remission. Biochemical and immunological parameters were controlled periodically to evaluate the clinical response and the possible side-effects. Two patients dropped out of the study because of anaemia and renal dysfunction, which returned to normal when cyclosporin was withdrawn. Our results confirm the efficacy of cyclosporin in the treatment of Behçet's disease.
