Behçet's disease is a chronic relapsing form of vasculitis affecting multiple organs. Central nervous system involvement is a common presentation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is considered to play a major role in the disease pathogenesis. We describe a patient with a long history of neuro-Behçet's disease who showed a remarkable response to infliximab therapy. Given the variable and limited success of other interventions, the use of anti-TNF-alpha therapy seems to be effective for patients with refractory disease.
