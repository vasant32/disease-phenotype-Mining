Our purpose was to characterise specific MRI findings and to determine their value in neuro-Behçet's disease. We examined 17 patients (14 men, 3 women) with neuro-Behçet's disease using T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images and contrast-enhanced images at 0.5 T. There were 13 patients (76.5%) who had single or multiple lesions. Most of these were in the basal ganglia, brain stem or deep white matter region, giving high signal on T2-weighted images and isointense or low signal on T1-weighted images. In 3 cases (17.6%) there was linear high signal along the posterior limb of the internal capsule on T2-weighted images. This was considered as a potential differentiating feature of neuro-Behçet's disease. Contrast-enhancement was seen in 17 lesions in 7 patients.
