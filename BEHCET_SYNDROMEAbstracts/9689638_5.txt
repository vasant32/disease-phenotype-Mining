BACKGROUND: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) may lead to blindness in up to 25% of eyes. Soluble (s)ICAM-1 but not sVCAM-1 is associated with relapse in idiopathic uveoretinitis and is reported to be raised in BD patients. We have investigated the levels of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 in Palestinian patients with BD and related them to both ocular and systemic disease activity and to immunosuppressive treatment. METHODS: A total of 51 patients (43 male, 8 female; mean ages 29.8 & 31.9 yr) were examined at the St John Ophthalmic Hospital during a one year period (135 consultations). Disease activity was determined from history and standard ocular examination. Anterior uveitis, vitritis and retinal vasculitis acted as markers of ocular inflammation. Peripheral venous sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 levels were determined by standard ELISA. A total of 53 healthy age- and sex-matched clinic staff members acted as controls. RESULTS: sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were both significantly lower in patients on systemic immunosuppression than in those off treatment (p < 0.001). Among patients off systemic treatment, sICAM was higher in the group with active systemic disease but quiet eyes (p = 0.003), but not in those with active ocular disease (p = 0.09), compared to controls. sVCAM was not raised in either group. CONCLUSION: Systemic immunosuppression was associated with reduced sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, supporting a role for adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of BD. sICAM-1 levels were raised in association with inflammatory features implicating endothelial activation in active BD. The mean sICAM-1 was higher in active ocular patients than controls.
