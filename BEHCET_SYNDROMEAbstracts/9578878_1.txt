A case is reported in which a Nucleus 22 channel intracochlear device was implanted a deaf/blind Hungarian adult with discharging ears suffering from Beh√ßet's disease. Preconditioning surgery was employed three months prior to the implantation procedure to ensure a sterile, dry protected environment for the electrodes. One month after implantation, the patient exhibited excellent auditory discrimination capability at the time of the first switch on. We suggest that some deaf/blind individuals may serve as very good candidates for intracochlear implantation.
