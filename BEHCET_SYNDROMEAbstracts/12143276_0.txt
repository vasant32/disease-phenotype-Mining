Beh√ßet disease is characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcerations as well as ocular involvement. We report five patients (three women) with this condition. All had oral or genital ulcerations, nodules or pustules. Three patients had an uveitis, two had vestibular involvement and one had a meningoencephalitis. One patient died after a massive hemoptysis.
