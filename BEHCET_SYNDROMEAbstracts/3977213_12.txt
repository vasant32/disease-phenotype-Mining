A retrospective clinical study made to determine the course and prognosis of the disease in 51 cases of Beh√ßet's disease, with a follow-up of at least one year (average five years, range 1 to 15 years), showed that 45% of the eyes kept visual acuities of 1/10 or less, and 44% 8/10 or better, four years after the onset of the ocular symptoms. Ten years later, some 50% of the eyes had visual acuities of 1/10 or less and 32% had acuities of 8/10 or better. In the group of patients who were treated early with chlorambucil, the eye prognosis was significantly improved.
