 PURPOSE: To review the etiologic factors and complications of uveitis in patients younger than 16 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1989 and December 1999 in the Department of Ophthalmology of Hacettepe University School of Medicine, 219 patients were diagnosed or observed as having pediatric uveitis. After complete ocular and physical examinations, routine and specific laboratory and radiologic investigations were performed. Medical or surgical treatment was employed when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 219 patients, 112 were girls, with a mean age of 7.4 +/- 4.2 years, and 107 were boys, with a mean age of 8.3 +/- 3.4 years. In 24.2% of the cases, no etiologic factor could be ascertained; these cases comprised the idiopathic group. Among the remaining cases, the most common etiologies were toxoplasmosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), pars planitis, Behçet's disease, and Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis. Anatomically, anterior uveitis was the most common form. The mean follow-up time was 37 +/- 6.2 months. Complications for which surgical treatment was employed were identified in 71 eyes (20.9%), most of which were due to JRA, pars planitis, or Behçet's disease. CONCLUSION: Uveitis in childhood may be idiopathic or most commonly due to toxoplasmosis, JRA, and pars planitis. Due to inflammation itself or to prolonged therapy especially with corticosteroids, pediatric uveitis entities (mostly JRA, pars planitis, or Behçet's disease) may result in complications necessitating a surgical approach.
