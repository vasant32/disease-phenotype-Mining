This paper reports a rare case of Hodgkin's disease with Sjögren syndrome in the course of Behçet's disease. A 43-year-old man developed arthralgia of bilateral knees, ankles, elbows and wrists in May, 1988. He had hazy vision and was diagnosed as having iridocyclitis and chorioretinitis in February, 1989. Gingival ulcer, penile ulcer, erythema nodosum on the right lower leg and superficial thrombophlebitis on the bilateral arms appeared in June, 1989. Therefore, he was diagnosed as Behçet's disease. He responded well to prednisolone. In November, 1989, he developed fever with positive CRP and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Multiple mass lesions in the liver and spleen with retrocrural lymphadenopathy were noticed on the abdominal CT and echogram. A cervical lymph node biopsy revealed Hodgkin's disease of the mixed cellularity type. At the same time, the patient had dry eyes and a dry mouth. Salivary gland biopsy revealed chronic sialoadenitis with lymphocytic infiltration compatible with Sjögren syndrome. The patient responded well to ABVD regimen. He is still free of disease as of May, 1991.
