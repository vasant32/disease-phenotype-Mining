Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder, and the underlying histophatological lesion is vasculitis of unknown cause. Some case reports of BD with positive C-ANCA titers have been reported, but only 2 case reports have documented the association of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (GN) and BD, and no renal transplantation cases have been described. We report such a case. A 27-year-old male was referred for consultation due to acute renal failure. Seven years before, BD was diagnosed. At the time of consultation he suffered from uveitis and generalized arthralgias. The serum creatinine was 14 mg/dl and urinalysis showed 4+ protein and microscopic hematuria. Results of serological tests were normal. The ANCA PR 3 titer was 1:100 of cytoplasmic pattern. A renal biopsy showed a rapidly progressive type III glomerulonephritis. In spite of immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide and high steroid doses, renal function did not recover and hemodialysis therapy was initiated. One year later, the patient underwent a renal transplantation. Follow-up was absolutely normal, and 5 years after transplantation, renal function persisted to be normal, without urinary abnormalities and signs of reactivation of original disease, except for occasional arthralgias. C-ANCA titer was decreased and remained stable (<1:30). He is now receiving maintenance immunosupression with cyclosporin and prednisone. This report shows the long-term successful renal transplantation in a patient with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis and BD. The success of renal transplant in BD with renal involvement is encouraging and should be pursued.
