A celiac artery aneurysm associated with Behçet's disease is extremely rare. We herein present the case of successful surgical treatment for an impending rupture of a large celiac artery aneurysm with a wide proximal neck in a patient associated with Behçet's disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a procedure involving extra-anatomic aorto-common hepatic artery (CHA) bypass through the retroperitoneal space implanting a 6-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft. An 18-month postoperative magnetic resonance angiography scan showed a good patency of the aorto-CHA graft without an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm in a closure of aorta and anastomoses.
