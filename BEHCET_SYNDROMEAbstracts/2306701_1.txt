In a patient with neuro-Beh√ßet (N-B) syndrome, MRI images obtained with TR 2000 msec, and TE 80 msec showed an increased signal intensity in the brain stem corresponding to the neurological symptoms. In N-B syndrome, the brain stem has been documented as a main site of the lesion, and MRI shows promise as a useful technique in the diagnosis of this disease.
