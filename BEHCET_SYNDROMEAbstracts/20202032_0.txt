Endocardial fibroelastosis is characterized by massive proliferation of collagenous and elastic tissue, in which the pathological process is restricted to the endocardium. In this report, we present the case of a 20-year-old man with Behcet's disease and endocardial fibroelastosis of the right ventricle involving tricuspid valve resulting in a tumor mass that was resected along with tricuspid valve replacement. The clinical and pathological features of this rare entity are reviewed.
