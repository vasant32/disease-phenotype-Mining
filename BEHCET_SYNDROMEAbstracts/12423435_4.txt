St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne cautiously prescribes thalidomide as a treatment for recalcitrant dermatoses. The guidelines used for prescribing and monitoring thalidomide for dermatological conditions at this institution are presented. Fourteen patients were treated with thalidomide (11 women, three men) over a 5-year period. The diagnoses of patients treated were actinic prurigo, prurigo nodularis, lupus erythematosus and Beh√ßet's syndrome. A clinical improvement was noted in 10 patients (71.4%) prescribed thalidomide. Cessation of thalidomide treatment occurred in seven patients (50%) because of adverse effects. Of the patients with adverse effects, four developed abnormal nerve conduction studies and three developed intolerable adverse events (such as dizziness and vomiting). Adverse effects from thalidomide treatment are common but, through vigilant treatment planning, patient education and regular monitoring, the risk of permanent peripheral neuropathy and teratogenicity from thalidomide toxicity can be minimized.
