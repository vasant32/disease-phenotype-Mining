Having considered the impact of the function of TLR2 in the recognition of several microorganisms that are thought to have an association with Beh√ßet's disease (BD), we aimed to determine a possible association between the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism and susceptibility to BD. We genotyped 83 patients with BD, 95 ethnically matched healthy controls, 12 patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) and 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by restriction fragment length polymorphism after PCR amplification of the genomic region encompassing the polymorphic site. Comparison of the TLR2 Arg753Gln A allele and A/G genotype frequencies did not show a significant difference between patients with BD and healthy controls (1.2% vs. 0.6%, and 2.1% vs. 1.1%, respectively). None of the patients from the RAS and RA groups had the A allele or A/G genotype. Our results indicate that the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism does not play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of BD.
