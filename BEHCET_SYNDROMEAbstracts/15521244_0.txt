Behcet's disease ( BD ) is a systemic inflammatory vascular disease with variable clinical manifestations and numerous clinical masquerades. The venous involvement may affect veins of different size with tendency for thrombosis. BD is the commonest cause of cerebral venous thrombosis in some Middle Eastern countries. However, in Thailand, this clinical entity has been rarely described as a cause of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A 38 year-old man presented with recurrent attacks of transient ischemic attack (TIA) for 9 months. Two months after the TIA, he developed right hemiparesis and persistent diffuse headache. He had a 10 year history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers. Physical examination revealed bilateral uveitis, right hemiparesis, bilateral sixth cranial nerve paresis and bilateral papilloedema. Pathergy skin test showed positive result. Neuroimaging demonstrated empty delta sign on CT-scan and thrombosis of the posterior part of superior saggital sinus, transverse sinus, straight sinus and internal jugular vein on magnetic resonance venography (MRV). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed increased intracranial pressure and aseptic CSF profiles. Prednisolone, chlorambucil and anticoagulant had been prescribed. The clinical course improved gradually.
