Cataract is one of the most common complications of ocular inflammation due to Behçet's disease. A retrospective clinical trial was performed to review the management and discuss the outcome of cataract extraction in patients with Behçet's disease in order to find the best method of treatment. Fifty-five eyes of 40 patients were included into the study group. The surgical methods used were intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), extracapsular cataract extraction+intraocular lens (ECCE+IOL), and extracapsular cataract extraction+trabeculectomy (ECCE+T). The postoperative visual prognosis was not satisfactory with any of the surgical methods because of the severe posterior segment complications of ocular Behçet's disease, particularly optic atrophy.
