Surgical treatment for aortic regurgitation (AR) caused by Behcet's disease is difficult due to the need to manipulate fragile, inflamed tissue. Valve detachment following aortic valve replacement (AVR) and suture detachment are serious postoperative complications. We investigated the surgical results in 11 patients. Between 1981 and July 1999, 11 patients, 9 males and 2 females, with AR caused by Behcet's disease underwent surgery. The age of these patients ranged from 33 to 60 years (mean, 45+/-8 years). The surgical procedures for AR were AVR in six patients and valved conduit operation in five patients. No patient died during the hospital stay. In a follow-up period ranging from 3 to 204 months (mean, 93+/-64 months) two patients died. Prosthetic valve detachment or suture detachment necessitating redo-operation occurred in four patients (36%) who then underwent a valved conduit procedure as a reoperation. Prosthetic valve detachment was higher in patients with AVR than in patients with a valved conduit operation. Valved conduit reconstruction is indicated in patients with AR caused by Behcet's disease in whom prevention of valve detachment is difficult even by current valve fixation methods.
