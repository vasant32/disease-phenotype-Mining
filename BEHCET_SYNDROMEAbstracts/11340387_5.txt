PURPOSE: To elucidate factors related to ocular inflammatory attacks after cataract surgery, limited to a single procedure of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, in patients with Behçet disease. METHODS: This retrospective study included 12 consecutive patients (16 eyes) with Behçet disease, who underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation during 4 years from January 1995 to December 1998 at three institutions. Their medical records were reviewed, and factors related to the ocular attacks were analyzed. RESULTS: Four eyes of 3 patients experienced ocular attacks during 1 year before cataract surgery, while 4 eyes of 4 patients developed ocular attacks during 1 year after the surgery. The development of ocular attacks after cataract surgery was significantly related with the presence of ocular attacks during 1 year before the surgery (p = 0.0286, chi(2) test). The patients' age or gender, the duration of Behçet disease or oral medications for Behçet disease did not show any relationship with the presence or absence of ocular attacks after cataract surgery. The visual acuity improved in all patients after the surgery, including those who developed ocular attacks. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of ocular attacks during 1 year before cataract surgery is related to postoperative ocular attacks. Despite postoperative ocular attacks, phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation is a safe procedure to expect a good visual outcome in patients with Behçet disease.
