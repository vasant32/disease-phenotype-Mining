OBJECTIVE: We report our surgical treatment results of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in Behçet's disease patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and June 2006, the authors have performed 21 procedures for AAA in 12 patients with Behçet's disease. Male to female sex ratio was 3:1 and mean age was 34 years old. Behçet's disease was diagnosed clinically using criteria of International Study Group for Behçet's Disease (1990). Retrospective analysis was made. RESULTS: There were six infrarenal, five suprarenal, and one double (suprarenal and infrarenal)AAA. Six graft interposition, six patch closure, and one stent-graft insertion were performed (one graft interposition and one patch closure were simultaneously performed for double AAA). Eight recurrent aneurysms were noted in six (50%) patients. Four stent-graft insertion, two patch closures, one graft interposition and one explothoracotomy only were performed for recurrent aneurysms. Overall recurrence rate of 21 procedures was 38.1%; 14.3% for graft interposition, 62.5% for patch closure, and 40% for stent-graft insertion. CONCLUSION: Though the resection and graft interposition is technically difficult in many occasions, it should be considered as the procedure of choice for abdominal aortic aneurysm in Behçet's disease. Endovascular interventions may be one of the treatment modality but the result needs further long-term follow-up.
