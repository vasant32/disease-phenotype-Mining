Systemic administration of steroids to patients with Behçet's disease in Japan is often followed by a worsening in ocular symptoms. The sensitivity of 7 patients with Behçet's disease to steroids which were administered during and after intraocular surgery was therefore measured, and their postoperative course was reviewed. Three of the 7 showed a low steroid sensitivity, and the frequency of postoperative inflammatory episodes and the intraocular pressure were both higher for this group than for the 4 who showed high steroid sensitivity.
