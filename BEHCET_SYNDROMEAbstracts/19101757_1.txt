Sympathetic storms (SyS) are characterized by hyperactivity of autonomic functions, resulting in episodes of hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperhidrosis. We show here a patient with neuro-Beh√ßet's disease (NBD) complicated by SyS. Although SyS is well known to occur with brain tumors, trauma, and hydrocephalus, this is the first report to show that SyS is a manifestation of central nervous system involvement in a patient with NBD. High concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and IL-8 in cerebrospinal fluid reflected the activity of SyS. The patient's symptoms showed almost complete improvement after treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide. Also, the concentrations of NE and IL-8 were decreased to normal levels. An awareness of the potential for SyS and adequate immunosuppressant therapy are of importance when dealing with patients with NBD.
