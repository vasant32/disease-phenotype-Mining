BACKGROUND: Behçet's aortitis is one of the most severe manifestations of Behçet's disease. However, there have been few reports of this rare entity. This article we describe our experience with surgical treatment of Behçet's aortitis in 8 patients. METHODS: From May 1978 to February 1995, we operated on 8 patients with Behçet's aortitis. All patients were followed up for a total of 54.4 patient-years (mean, 6.8 years). RESULTS: There were no operative deaths, but 1 patient died in the hospital of ventricular fibrillation. Another death occurred as a result of pseudoaneurysm rupture 10 months after operation. Fourteen operations were performed on eight patients: a second operation was performed on four patients, and a third operation was performed on two patients. The translocated Bentall procedure, a modified Bentall procedure, was performed six times. One patient required a second operation for graft detachment, but the others have done well without further surgical intervention. Aortic valve replacement was performed six times, and three reoperations were needed after aortic valve replacement. CONCLUSIONS: The translocated Bentall procedure may be effective for Behçet's aortitis, but further investigation is necessary.
