Twenty-four different antigens from 6 strains of streptococcus were prepared for skin testing and delayed hypersensitivity testing. The induction of Behçet's disease symptoms by these antigens was studied. Delayed skin reactions to whole cells and cell walls of streptococci were frequently observed in Behçet's disease, but only a few skin reactions were observed in other diseases and healthy controls. The skin reactions to the other bacteria were also strong in Behçet's disease, but the differences between Behçet's disease and the other diseases were not significant. Interestingly, the induction of systemic Behçet's disease symptoms was observed after the streptococcus skin test in 15 of 85 cases tested, but no case of induction by the other bacteria was observed. Our study supports the possible pathogenetic role of certain streptococcal antigens in Behçet's disease.
