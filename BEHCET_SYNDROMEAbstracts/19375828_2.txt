 INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to analyse the incidence and the main characteristics of optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease. METHODS: A retrospective review of a well-documented population of 376 Tunisian patients with Behçet's disease was performed. All patients fulfilled three or more criteria defined by the International Study Group for Behçet's Disease. The diagnosis of optic neuropathy was based on the clinical examination, visual field, visual evoked potentials and retinal angiography. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (4.7 %) presented an optic nerve involvement. The mean age at presentation of these patients (10 men and nine women) was 39.11+/-12.9 years (range 17 to 73). The mean vision at presentation was 4.2/10+/-2.9, the vision was less than 1/10 in 34.5 % of eyes. The optic neuropathy was anterior in 89 % cases (26 eyes, 90 %), posterior in one case (2 eyes, 7 %); one patient (1 eye, 3 %) presented an optic atrophy. The optic neuropathy was associated with other ocular lesions in 13 cases (72.2 %). It was an inflammatory neuropathy in four cases (22.3 %) and a stasis papilledema complicating a benign intracranial hypertension in five cases (27.8 %). Corticosteroids were administrated in 17 cases (94.4 %), cyclophosphamide in six cases (33.3 %) and anticoagulant therapy in one patient (5.6 %). After a mean duration of 79 months (range: three months to 12 years), a third of the patients (8 eyes, 27.5 %) have a visual loss. CONCLUSION: Optic neuropathy is a rare ocular involvement in Behçet's disease. It can be related to an inflammatory neuropathy, a stasis papilledema complicating a benign intracranial hypertension or an ischemic neuropathy. The association of optic neuropathy with other ocular lesions could be responsible for a diagnostic delay. Its treatment relies on systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. The prognosis remained poor, with a third of the patients having lost their sight.
