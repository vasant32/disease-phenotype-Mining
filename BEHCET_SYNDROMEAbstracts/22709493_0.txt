 AIM:   In Behcet's disease (BD), it is customary to believe that men are more affected than women, major organs are more involved in men, and they have worse outcomes. The male-to-female ratio is reported from 5.37 to 1 (Egypt), to 0.38 to 1 (US). If in the majority of reports BD was seen more frequently in men, in some others it was more frequent in women. The aim of this study was to examine a large cohort of patients, in whom manifestations were gender related, and to examine the strength of associations and their clinical relevance. PATIENTS AND METHODS:   All patients of the BD registry, Rheumatology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, entered the study (6702 patients). The percentage of 95 items was calculated in both genders (with their 95% confidence intervals), and were compared together by the chi-squared test. Odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) were also calculated. RESULTS:   Forty-three out of 95 items were gender-related (29 for males, 14 for females) with a statistically significant difference by chi-squared. Significant OR (confidence interval not reaching 1) was found for 79 items. However, clinically significant OR (2 or more for men and 0.5 or less for women) showed an association only with 16 items; five with females and 11 with males. The most important was vascular involvement. CONCLUSION:   No strong association (OR of 2 or more) was found between the male gender and major organ involvement, except for vascular lesions.
