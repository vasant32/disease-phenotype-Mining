A case of Behçet's disease with Budd-Chiari's syndrome in 31-year-old japanese is reported. In the Annuals of Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1974 to 1983, 122 autopsy cases of Behçet's disease were recorded. Among them, 4 cases showed Budd-Chiari's syndrome including our case. This manifestation in Behçet's disease will not be incidental but a disease process of vascular type, itself. Although the autopsy rate of all the death in Japan is 4.4%, in the last 10 years (1974-1983), that of Behçet's disease is 14.2% (1976-1983). So our data from the autopsy series of all over Japan will show the pathologic lesions of the fatal cases and statistically be significant.
