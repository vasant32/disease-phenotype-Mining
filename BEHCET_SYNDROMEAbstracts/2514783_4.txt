We report our studies on the cutaneous and plasma fibrinolytic activities (FA) in nine patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) as compared with nine normal controls. The euglobulin lysis time of the plasma and cutaneous fibrinolytic activity were determined in these patients. The studies showed that the plasma fibrinolytic activity was reduced in the patients with BD and there was impaired cutaneous fibrinolytic potential, tPA dependent, in those patients with venous and arterial thromboses.
