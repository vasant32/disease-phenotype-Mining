BACKGROUND: Micturitional disturbance is known to occur in neuro-Beh√ßet's syndrome (NBS). However, its pathophysiology is uncertain and few data are available concerning urodynamic findings. We describe our findings on micturitional histories and urodynamic studies in patients with NBS. METHODS: A history of urinary symptoms was obtained from nine patients with NBS [seven male, two female, aged 26 to 54 years; mean, 41 years]. Neurological and CT/MRI findings indicated that their lesions were located mainly in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem and the spinal cord. Symptomatic patients underwent urodynamic studies, including measurement of post-micturition residuals, urethral pressure profilometry and EMG cystometry. RESULTS: Six of the nine patients (67%) had urinary symptoms that included diurnal urinary frequency in five, sensation of urgency in five, urge urinary incontinence in five, voiding difficulty in five and nocturnal urinary frequency in four. None had urinary retention. Urodynamic studies performed in six patients showed post-micturition residuals in five (50-180 ml), increased maximum urethral closure pressure in two, decrease in four and increase in one of bladder capacities, detrusor hyperreflexia in five, decreased bladder sensation in one, brisk bulbocavernosus reflex in four, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in two and neurogenic sphincter EMG in one. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that micturitional disturbance is not rare in patients with NBS. Supranuclear pelvic nerve dysfunction seems to be mainly responsible for the disturbance.
