 OBJECTIVE: Behçet's disease is one of the major aetiologies of uveitis causing blindness in Asian countries. A genome-wide association study identified six microsatellite markers as disease susceptibility loci for Japanese patients with Behçet's disease. To confirm our recent results, these microsatellite markers were examined in a Korean population as a replication study. METHODS: Study participants included 119 Behçet's disease patients and 141 controls. All were enrolled in Korea. Association between the six reported microsatellite markers (D3S0186i, D6S0014i, D6S0032i, 536G12A, D12S0645i and D22S0104i) and Behçet's disease was analysed. HLA-B was genotyped by sequence-based typing methods. RESULTS: A microsatellite marker located near the HLA-B region demonstrated significant association with Behçet's disease (P = 0.028). The genotype and phenotype frequencies of the HLA-B*51 gene were significantly increased in patients (23.1 and 39.5%, respectively) compared with healthy controls (11.2 and 20.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Microsatellite analysis revealed that the HLA-B*51 gene was strongly associated with Behçet's disease in a Korean population.
