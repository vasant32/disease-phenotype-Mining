We report a 32-year-old woman diagnosed with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and Behcet's Syndrome. Suspicion of SIH was based on cervical MRI findings, and magnetic resonance (MR)-cisternography revealed dural leaks bilaterally at lumbar region. MR-cisternography is a recently performed technique and gaining importance in demonstration of CSF fistula.
