The etiology and treatment of Beh√ßet's diseases are still undecided. There are three principal etiological hypotheses: viral, autoimmune and defective fibrinolytic activity. Accordingly, antiviral, immunosuppressive and fibrinolytic enhancing agents have been tried. Corticosteroids, however, still consitute conventional therapy. Follow-up of cases has so far revealed that none of the above therapeutic measures fundamentally alters the course of the disease, and serious complications may occur and progress during their administration.
