A 64-year-old woman with severe intestinal Behçet's disease who was unresponsive to conventional therapies, including intensive intravenous steroid injections, underwent intraarterial steroid injection therapy. After the infusion of prednisolone into the mesenteric arteries, her colon ulcers improved markedly, and the frequency of bloody stools decreased immediately. The present case suggests that intraarterial steroid injection therapy may be potentially useful in severe intestinal Behçet's disease.
