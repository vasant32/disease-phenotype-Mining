A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with Beh√ßet disease (BD) on the basis of an 8-year history of episodes of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, papulopustular lesions on physical examination, and a positive pathergy test. Two years prior to diagnosis of BD, vitiligo had also been diagnosed on the basis of hypopigmented lesions on the scrotum following genital ulceration. To our knowledge, this is the first case of incidental coexistence of BD and vitiligo, and, furthermore, the first case of koebnerization of genital ulceration of BD.
