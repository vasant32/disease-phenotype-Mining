Beh√ßet disease is a systemic disease with diverse clinical symptoms which include, but not limited to, patients having oral and genital ulcers and eye involvement. We here report an 18-year-old male presenting with massive hemoptysis and cardiac arrest, having history of ulcers in the oral cavity and genitalia as well as having recent episode of uveitis. A pulmonary CT angiography revealed bilateral arterial aneurysms of pulmonary vessels. On receiving Immunosuppressive treatment for Behcet disease with prednisone and azathioprine over one year the pulmonary arterial aneurysms were completely resolved and the patient was discharged from the hospital albeit with persistent hypoxic brain injury from cardiac arrest.
