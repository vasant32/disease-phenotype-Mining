A 45-year-old woman complained of fever, arthralgia and left hemiparesis. She had suffered from recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis and erythema nodosum. Laboratory examination demonstrated pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. MRI showed foci of high signal intensity on the T2-weighted images in the right pontine base, surrounded by a rim of low signal intensity suggestive of small hemorrhages. Following steroid therapy, these symptoms diminished and abnormal findings in brain MRI improved. This MRI findings may be due to hemosiderin deposition at recent stage resulting hemorrhages in foci of acute inflammation stage. We would like to emphasize that MRI are useful to evaluate the lesion of neuro-Beh√ßet's disease and some lesions may behave like hemorrhages.
