Unusual radiological manifestations of rare complications of cardiovascular Behcet disease (BD) are the following: (a) aneurysm and (b) occlusion in the aorta and its major branches, (c) pseudoaneurysms on the aortic root and coronary artery, and recurrent valvular dehiscence in the heart, (d) venous thrombosis in the deep and superficial venous system and vena cava. The initial exact diagnosis of cardiovascular BD has been extremely difficult for these rare complicated findings, especially in the absence of the florid clinical manifestations of BD. Radiologist should be aware of possibility of cardiovascular BD via familiarity with its rare imaging features, including computed tomographic angiography (and its 3-dimensional reconstructed images), conventional angiography, and with the clinical characteristics of BD because of high mortality of cardiovascular BD.
