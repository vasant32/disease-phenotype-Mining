Hulusi Behçet (1889-1948) was an internationally oriented Turkish dermatologist. He was closely involved in establishing the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, where he later became a professor. In addition, Behçet was a scientist and an editor of the German professional journal, Dermatologische Wochenschrift. In articles published in this journal, he had written about 3 patients who suffered from an inexplicable triad of symptoms: eye problems, oral en genital ulcers. This oculo-urogenital syndrome now bears his name: 'Behçet's disease'.
