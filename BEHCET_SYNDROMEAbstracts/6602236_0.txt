The levels of circulating immune complexes (CICs) were investigated in the patients with Behçet's disease by Clq solid-phase enzyme immunoassay. A significantly higher level of CICs was observed in the patients than in the control group. Concerning the correlation between the levels of CICs and the stages of the ocular attack, the levels were significantly higher in the preattack stage and the early stage of the attack than in the late stage and the remission phase. A high level of CICs was associated with the patients of the fulminant form of ocular attacks. These results suggest that immune complexes may play a role in the development of the ocular attack of Behçet's disease.
