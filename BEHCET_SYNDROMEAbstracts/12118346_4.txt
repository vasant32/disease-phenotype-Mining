Behçet's disease is characterized by recurrent ulcers of the mouth and genitalia and relapsing iritis. It is recognized as a chronic multisystem disease affecting the skin, mucous membranes, eye, joints, central nervous system, and blood vessels. About 8% of the patients with Behçet's disease have severe vascular complications such as arterial aneurysm and occlusion. In our patient, there was a massive, painful, pulsatile mass on the clavicle on the right side of neck. A left subclavian artery aneurysm mass was observed on the left apex on a chest X-ray. Through angiography, a lobular giant saccular aneurysm on the proximal side of the right subclavian artery, giant aneurysm on the left subclavian artery, and occlusion on the left subclavian-axillary artery were observed. We treated first the right and then the left subclavian arterial aneurysm with a two-stage operation. The aneurysms were resected and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft interposition was performed. Control angiography was performed 6 months postoperatively. Both grafts were open and there was no anastomotic aneurysm. The patient was reoperated on for a ruptured abdominal aorta pseudoaneurysm 13 months after the first operation. The aortic defect was repaired using a Dacron patch.
