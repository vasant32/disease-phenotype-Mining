BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease (BD) shows great regional differences in clinical manifestations and prognosis, including eye involvement. Thus, it is hard to predict in which patient the eyes will be involved and what the outcome will be. In this study we assessed various risk factors for eye involvement and attempted to predict the visual outcome in our patient population in Turkey. METHODS: Data from a total of 224 patients with BD, diagnosed between 1982 and 1996, were analyzed retrospectively. A detailed physical examination and ophthalmologic work up were performed on each patient. Factors that might contribute to eye involvement were investigated, after which prognostic factors for vision were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients had eye involvement during a median follow-up of 32 months. The risk of involvement was highest within the first year of diagnosis. Young age was the most significant factor for eye involvement (P < 0.0001), but vascular thrombosis, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and male gender were other risk factors (P < 0.001; P < 0.01; and P < 0.05, respectively). The most important determinant for the prognosis of vision was CNS involvement (P < 0.0001). Vascular thrombosis and an age of < or = 32 were other risk factors for visual impairment (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). The risk of eye involvement and prognosis for vision were similar with different treatment regimens (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the first 2 years after diagnosis is the most critical period for eye involvement, and conventional forms of therapy generally are unsuccessful in preventing such involvement. It seems reasonable to treat patients who are at increased risk for eye involvement more aggressively, especially within the first 2 years of disease onset.
