Behcet's disease is a multisystemic vasculitis of unknown origin whose classical triad is oral and genital ulcers and uveitis. Deep venous thrombosis may sometimes be the first manifestation of this disease but is very rare in children. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy with deep venous thrombosis of the leg and a history of severe aphthous gingivostomatitis, perianal ulcers, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, ecchymotic lesions on the lower limbs and intermittent swelling of the left ankle. Complementary tests ruled out the main causes of thrombosis in children. HLA-B5 and B-51 study proved positive, which, together with the patient's history, suggested a diagnosis of Behcet's disease. This disease usually presents around the third decade of life and is very unusual in children. This case is exceptional because thrombosis as an early manifestation of Behcet's disease is very rare in children and because it led to the diagnosis of Behcet's disease in our patient.
