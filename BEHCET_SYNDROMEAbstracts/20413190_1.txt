Eye involvement in Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is frequent and an important cause of morbidity. The mean age at onset of uveitis is between 20 and 30 years in male and 30 years in female patients. Ocular involvement includes anterior, posterior or panuveitis. Uveitis may be the presenting manifestation of the disease in 20% of cases or may appear 2 or 3 years after the disease onset. The estimated risk of blindness at 5 years ranges from 15 to 25%. The main goals in the management of patients with BD uveitis are the rapid control of intraocular inflammation, the prevention of recurrent attacks, the achievement of complete remission, and preservation of vision. The medical treatment of patients with severe uveitis relies on the use of systemically administered drugs, including corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents. Anti-TNF agents and interferon-alpha seem to be efficient and well-tolerated alternative therapeutic options. Controlled clinical trials are mandatory to define the place of these new immunomodulatory agents in the therapeutic strategy, and especially their use as first-line therapy.
