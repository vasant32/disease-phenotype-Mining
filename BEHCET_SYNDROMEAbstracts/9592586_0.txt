Although retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a rather seldom complication of Behçet's syndrome it is in no way unusual. Younger patients in particular those from the eastern Mediterranean or east Asian regions in whom a retroperitoneal hemorrhage or an aneurysm in the aorto-iliaco-femoral flow region has be diagnosed must be considered for the differential diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome. The consequences for the surgeon are resection deep into healthy tissue and in general an appropriately close follow-up with strict avoidance of arterial angiography.
