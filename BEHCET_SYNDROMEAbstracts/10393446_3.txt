BACKGROUND: The nosologic field of aphthosis is not well defined. While criteria for Beh√ßet's disease (BD) are lacking in severe unipolar or bipolar aphthosis, these disorders however lead to an important impairment of quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between severe aphthosis and BD. METHODS: Records of all patients hospitalized for aphthosis or BD during a 20-year period were reviewed. RESULTS: According to clinical data, cases (n = 104) were classified as unipolar aphthosis (group I, n = 53), bipolar aphthosis (group II, n = 30) or BD (group III, n = 21). The characteristics of aphthae (number, localization, recurrences, presence of scars) were similar in all groups. Specific cutaneous manifestations (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, papulonodules) were present in 15, 17 and 95% of patients of groups I, II and III. Cutaneous puncture hypersensitivity was present in 14 out of 18 patients of group III and no patient of the two other groups. At least one extramucous specific manifestation (cutaneous, ophthalmologic, neurologic, articular, vascular) was present in 43% of patients of group I and II, and 100% in group III. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis of a continuous spectrum linking severe aphthosis to BD.
