After presenting two personal observations, the authors underline the fact that the neurological manifestations of Behçet's disease are more frequent than they were supposed to be. Their symptoms are overly manifold but have in common constant abnormality in the cerebrospinal fluid when an attack occurs. The affection is a very serious one demanding an early and well established diagnosis only to be obtained thanks to a clinical examination. Corticosteroïd therapy (1 mg/kg per day) either alone or associated with immuno-suppressive therapy may check the attack. Preventing relapses implies a non-stop treatment. Immuno-suppressive therapy seems to be the most efficient one.
