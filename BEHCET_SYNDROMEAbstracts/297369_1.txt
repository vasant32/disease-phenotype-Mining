Some preliminary results are given on human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing of nine patients with sympathetic ophthalmitis, two with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and nine with Behçet's disease and uveitis. In the sympathetic ophthalmitis patients the relative risk for B40 was 7.2, which would indicate that a more extensive study might be valuable. In Behçet's disease B5 and B27 both carried increased risks of 9.4 and 11.1 respectively.
