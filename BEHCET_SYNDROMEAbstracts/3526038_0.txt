With the object to clarify the different aphthous syndromes, their clinical manifestations, histopathological and radiological patterns and their evolution, the authors report three patients (26 year old woman with a bipolar aphthosis, Neumann type; 47 year old man with a Behcet's syndrome, and a 53 year old woman with a recurrent necrotic mucous periadenitis), pointing out that these entities are as important for dermatologists as for the other specialists.
