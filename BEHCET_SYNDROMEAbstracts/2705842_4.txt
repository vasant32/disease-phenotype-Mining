We describe the case of a young European woman with Beh√ßet's disease, hemoptysis, and multiple, large aneurysms of pulmonary arteries as confirmed by computed tomographic scan and angiography. Complete resolution of hemoptysis and radiologic signs of pulmonary artery aneurysms was observed three months after prednisone treatment, and a persisting remission was noted after ten months. We reviewed the literature on this rare complication and described the therapeutic approaches.
