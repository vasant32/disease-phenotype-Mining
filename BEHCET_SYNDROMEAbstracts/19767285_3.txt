We present the case of an 18-year-old male patient with Beh√ßet's disease who presented with dyspnoea, fever and haemoptysis. A diagnosis of right ventricular thrombosis associated with endomyocardial fibrosis, a pulmonary artery aneurysm, and cerebral vein thrombosis was made. Considering the absence of haemodynamic compromise and the risk of recurrence after surgical treatment for cardiac thrombus, we preferred medical management, which consisted of immunosuppression and anticoagulation. During a follow-up period of 9 months we observed complete dissolution of the thrombus and dramatic improvement of the patient's clinical status.
