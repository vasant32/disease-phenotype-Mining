We examined 21 cases of Neuro-Behçet's syndrome in detail, and present here their clinicoradiological characteristics. Clinically, signs of pyramidal tract and meningeal irritation were frequently observed. In contrast to previous reports, our study demonstrated a near equal frequency in the occurrence of focal cerebral lesions and that of focal brain stem lesions. Notably, our results showed that the atrophy of both the cerebrum and the brain stem was often observed, indicating the presence of continuous disease activity in the central nervous system (CNS). In accordance with the high frequency of meningeal irritation signs, all of our cases exhibited pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These results indicated the possibility that chemical mediators secreted from infiltrating cells in the CSF may somehow inflict damage to the CNS in Neuro-Behçet's syndrome.
