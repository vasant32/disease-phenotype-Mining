 PURPOSE: To investigate the frequency and phenotypic and functional characteristics of S-antigen (S-Ag) specific T cells in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). METHODS: Blood was taken from 23 active BD patients, 12 inactive BD patients, and 14 healthy controls. The clinical features of the patients were summarized. T cell response against 40 mixed S-Ag peptides was identified by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT). CD69 and CD45RO were used to characterize the phenotype of S-Ag specific T cells. The functional property of S-Ag specific T cells was investigated by measuring the production of cytokines. RESULTS: Response to the mixed S-Ag peptides was found in 56.5% and 25% of active and inactive BD patients, respectively. The responsiveness to S-Ag peptides was unrelated to the clinical features of the patients. About 65.8% of IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) T cells in active BD patients expressed CD69 and CD45RO concomitantly. S-Ag peptides significantly induced a production of IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha but not interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-17 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in active BD patients with a response to S-Ag. CONCLUSIONS: S-Ag specific T cells are present in certain active BD patients, and most of them are activated memory CD4(+) T cells. These T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of BD via producing Th1-dominant cytokines.
