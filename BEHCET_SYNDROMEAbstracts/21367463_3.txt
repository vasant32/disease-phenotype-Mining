Neurological manifestations are present in 5% to 30% of patients with Behçet's disease (BD). Neuro-Behçet's Disease (NBD) is hypothetically caused by T helper (Th) cells, which development is dependent on the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mRNA expression of TBX21, GATA3, RORC, FOXP3 and EBI3 were assessed in 18 NBD patients and 26 controls disease [16 noninflammatory neurological disease (NIND) and 10 headache attributed to Behçet's disease (HaBD)]. Expression of TBX21 (Th1), RORC (Th17) and Foxp3 (Treg) were increased in NBD patients compared to HaBD and NIND patients. EBI3 and Th2-associated GATA3 expressions were found to be decreased (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001) in NBD patients. Analysis of transcription factor ratios, revealed an increase in the RORC/FOXP3 and TBX21/GATA3 ratios in NBD patients (P<0.0001; P<0.0003). Our findings indicate that both Th1 and Th17 mRNA expressions involving a possible impairment of Treg cells. This might play a role in CSF-NBD inflammation, permitting activation of harmful T cell subpopulations. The TBX21/GATA3 and RORC/FOXP3 ratios dysregulations in NBD are consistent with those reported in other inflammatory diseases and indicating the plasticity existing between Th1, Th17 and Treg cells during inflammation.
