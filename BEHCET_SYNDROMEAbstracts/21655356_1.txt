 PURPOSE: To investigate the profile of T-helper type 17 (Th17) cell-related cytokines (interleukin-23 [IL-23], IL-27, IL-17 and interferon-γ [IFN-γ]) in postoperative inflammation in patients with Behcet disease (BD) after cataract surgery. METHODS: Serum was collected from seven BD patients with complicated cataract, and from nine controls with uncomplicated cataract, before cataract surgery, and again 1, 7, 30, and 90 days after surgery. In addition, aqueous humor was collected at commencement of surgery. The protein levels of IL-23, IL-27, IL-17, and IFN-γ in the serum and in the aqueous humor were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A laser flare-cell photometer was used to quantify intraocular inflammation. RESULTS: Serum IL-23, IL-27, and IFN-γ levels were significantly increased after cataract surgery in the BD versus the control patients. In the BD patients, serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-27 correlated strongly with aqueous flare values and cell counts. Remarkably, the levels of serum IL-27 were significantly associated with serum IFN-γ levels in BD patients (r=0.796; p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that serum IFN-γ and IL-27 levels are significantly elevated in BD versus control patients and are strongly associated with post-operative intraocular inflammation.
