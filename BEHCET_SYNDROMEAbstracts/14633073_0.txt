We present here a case of invasive bladder carcinoma in a 51-year-old man with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). A radical cystoprostatectomy was performed and postoperative chemotherapy was administered to treat lymph node metastasis. However, the patient died 6 months after the operation. Malignancies associated with BD are very uncommon. The incidence, diagnosis and management of our case is discussed in the present paper.
