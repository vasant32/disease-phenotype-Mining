This is the case report of a woman who for many years was a diagnostic puzzle. Her various problems were eventually identified as features of Beh√ßet's syndrome, which is uncommon in this country. Besides the known clinical symptoms of the disease, this patient has suffered intermittently from dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia, which may well be features of this disorder which have not previously been documented. There is no sign of remission for this patient, but awareness of her condition should lead to more sympathetic management of these cases.
