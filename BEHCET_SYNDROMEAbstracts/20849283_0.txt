Laser flare photometry (LFP) is a method used to detect flare in the anterior chamber (AC). Until now several laser flare photometers have been developed and are in use. LFP is not yet used in all major uveitis centres and, in order to understand this reluctance and know whether use of LFP is justified and should be recommended, an expert meeting was deemed necessary leading to this publication. Besides others results included the following: There is variation between users with regard to how many readings are necessary varying from 3 to 10. It appears appropriate to use at least 6-10 readings. LFP is most useful in patients with anterior uveitis. In patients with posterior and intermediate uveitis, at least 15 photons in the anterior chamber is considered the necessary threshold to be reliable to monitor evolution of inflammation. Factors influencing the measurement of LFP are cataract, corneal opacity, pupil size, intraocular lens and shallow anterior chamber but this is mostly irrelevant in pathological situation. LFP can be used to adjust the management of patients with uveitis, but not necessarily influence treatment. Exceptions may be patients with JIA and Behcet's Disease. LFP results should always be interpreted in conjunction with the usually clinical observations. There is some evidence that worsening of the flare on two consecutive visits is predictive of a relapse, especially in patients with Behcet's disease. LFP maybe also useful for predicting rejection of corneal transplant when the cornea is not thickened.
