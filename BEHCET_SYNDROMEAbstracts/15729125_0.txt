We report an extremely rare case of Beh√ßet disease complicated by diffuse alveolar damage, which was fatal in this patient. It manifested as progressive diffuse ground-glass attenuation in both lungs on chest radiographs and high-resolution CT. Ground-glass attenuation was confirmed histopathologically as diffuse alveolar damage without identified etiology by open lung biopsy.
