Macroscopic, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features of eight 1- to 7-day-old minor (Mikulicz) aphthae, one herpetiform ulcer, and one ulcer from a patient with Behcet's syndrome were studied. In addition to light and electron microscopy, methods included the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique to disclose binding of IgA, IgG, IgM, Clq, and C3. Observations revealed the presence and distribution of extravasates of erythrocytes at and around the ulcers, extravascular neutrophilic granulocytes undermining the oral epithelium of the ulcer margin, the presence of numerous macrophages loaded with phagolysosomes containing debris of neutrophilic granulocytes, particular pathomorphologic features of a Behcet lesion and a herpetiform lesion, and the occurrence in diseased and normal oral mucosa of particular stratum spinosum cells binding nonselectively all immune components tested in this study, probably by leakage and passive diffusion of serum proteins. The observations fit the concept of immune complex vasculitis being essential in the pathogenesis of oral aphthous ulcerations.
