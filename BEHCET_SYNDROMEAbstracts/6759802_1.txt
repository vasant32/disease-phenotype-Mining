The authors summarize their experience in the treatment of recurrent, necrotic and giant mucocutaneous aphthosis (9 cases) and Behçet's disease (9 cases) with Thalidomide during four years. In recurrent mucocutaneous aphthosis the results were very good, with fast disappearance of pain, healing of the ahthae and disappearance or delay of recurrence. The result in Behçet's disease is similar, possibly less, in mucocutaneous lesions. Uveitis also reacts favorably but we can not say that the results were superior to those obtained by other drugs (corticoids, cytostatics immunosuppressives), although its side effects are less. On the other hand it does not appear to have any effect on other symptoms such as arthritis (in which colchicine is active), thromboflebitis or fever. There is not sufficient experience to judge its action on neurological symptoms. The recommended dose is 100 mgr./day for 10 days, a higher dose does not appear to give better results. Patients who have received treatment several times appear to have the same results, but slower. Neurotoxicity has not been observed and the only side effect which has been noted is digestive intolerance in two cases, after which the medication was stopped. The authors consider that Thalidomide, with due precaution, which must be scrupulously determined, is the most active medicament in particularly severe cases with profusion of necrotic aphthae, mutilating and recurring mucocutaneous aphthosis, also being useful in controlling some symptoms of Behçet's disease.
