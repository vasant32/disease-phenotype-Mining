Pulmonary manifestations of Behcet's disease are not very common and usually include pulmonary artery aneurysms, central venous thrombosis, pneumonia and pleurisy. Chylothorax secondary to superior vena caval obstruction is a rare complication and has been reported in only a few cases. We report a case of a 24-year-old man presenting with massive chylothorax as the initial presentation of Behcet's disease that was successfully treated conservatively.
