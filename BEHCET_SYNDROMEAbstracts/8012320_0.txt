Differentiation of Behçet's disease from the cryptogenic enteropathies can raise diagnostic and nosological problems. The segments of the digestive tract most commonly involved in Behçet's disease are the ileum and colon; rectal manifestations are exceedingly rare. We report six Behçet's disease patients who had rectitis with clinical and histological features reminiscent of ulcerative colitis. However the colon was normal. Immunopathological differences between the two diseases have been reported by other investigators.
