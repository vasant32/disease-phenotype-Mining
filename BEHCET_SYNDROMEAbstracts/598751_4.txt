Suppression of the fibrinolytic system is a well-known phenomenon in patients with Behçet's disease. It is generally explained by an increase in the inhibitory potential. In order to prove this theory, the fibrinolytic system was investigated in 5 male patients with severe chronic Behçet's disease. By the venous occlusion test, a marked suppression of the activatability of the system could be demonstrated (euglobulin lysis time, various fibrin plate assays). Results of analysis of the known inhibitors could not explain the phenomenon: antithrombin III, alpha2-macroglobulin, fast-reacting alpha2-antiplasmin, C1 inactivator, and the plasmin-antiplasmin complex were normal. The only change was an elevation of alpha1-antitrypsin and fibrinogen in 4 patients possibly due to an acute phase reaction. In addition to the possibility of a hitherto unidentified inhibitor, therefore, a decrease in production or in release of vessel wall activators must also be considered in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
