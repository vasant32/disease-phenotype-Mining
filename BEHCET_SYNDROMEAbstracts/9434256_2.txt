Excessive superoxide radical production and an impaired antioxidant mechanism in both the neutrophils and plasma of patients with Behçet's disease (BD) have been reported. To provide clinical support for the earlier data, erythrocyte membrane integrity was investigated by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation) levels in the erythrocytes of BD patients. In addition, the antioxidant effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) at 25 and 250 microg/ml concentrations on lipoperoxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in erythrocyte obtained from BD patients was examined in in vitro conditions. When compared to healthy controls, basal erythrocyte MDA levels were found to be higher in BD patients. In the in vitro study, there was also a significant increase in H2O2-induced MDA production in the medium containing no EGb 761 in the patient group, whereas significant decreases in MDA levels were observed in the mediums containing EGb 761 both in the patient and control groups. The decrease in MDA production was found to be related to EGb 761 concentration. These data indicate that an oxidative damage is present in erythrocytes obtained from Behçet's patients, and EGb 761, which may strengthen the antioxidant defense system, may contribute to the treatment of BD.
