We describe a case of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) which showed the ileocecal ulcer and cecocecal fistula. This 38-year-old man had appendectomy six years ago because of colicky pain in the right lower abdomen (RLA). There are some reports on fistula formation in BD. In those, some are related to surgery and others are not. BD with cecocecal fistula, possibly associated with a past operation, has not been reported in the literature.
