Great achievements have been obtained in the studies on the pathogenesis of uveitis during recent years. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the anterior chamber associated immune deviation, the development of autoimmune response and uveitis following infections are still not completely understood. The reason as to why there is a big difference concerning the clinical process between human uveitis and its counterpart, uveitis induced in animal, is expected to be investigated. Gene susceptibility to uveitis is not well understood. Behcet disease and Vogt-Kayanagi-Harada syndrome are the two most common uveitis entities in China. Therefore, studies should be focused on both diseases to clarify the aforementioned issues, which will greatly contribute to the development of strategy in the treatment and prevention of uveitis.
