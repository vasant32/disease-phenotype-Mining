We report here an autopsy case of neuro-Behçet's disease. The patient was a 28-year-old man, who developed a slight fever, right uveitis, and right sensory neural hearing loss at the age of 25. These symptoms relapsed repeatedly despite treatment. Eventually he was admitted to hospital because of progressing neurological deficits such as pyramidal symptoms, somatic sensorial and autonomic disorders, and bulbar palsy. The patient's condition deteriorated and he died of heart failure. Total clinical course was about three years. In postmortem examination, various-sized necrotic foci, often accompanied by gliosis and foamy macrophage infiltration, were scattered in the diencephalic region and brain stem. Meningitis was observed on the ventral side of the brain stem as well as inferior cerebral surface. Nonbacterial or non-fungal acute perivascular inflammatory foci were also present in the brain stem and cerebellar parenchyma. These histopathological findings suggest that a destructive multifocal neutrophilic inflammation might have caused the neurological deficits. Perivascular inflammation might be important to understanding the pathogenesis of neuro-Behçet's disease.
