Seven cases of Behçet's disease involving the intestines are reported. The terminal ileum and the ileocecal area was involved in all seven cases, with complications requiring surgical treatment. Primary right hemicolectomy and ileal resection was performed in six, and ileal resection in one patient who required a secondary right hemicolectomy because of leakage from the small bowel anastomosis. In two patients the disease was classified as complete and in five patients as incomplete. The results of this experience with seven cases of intestinal Behçet's disease have demonstrated that the complications may be serious, and that surgical treatment should be considered more readily.
