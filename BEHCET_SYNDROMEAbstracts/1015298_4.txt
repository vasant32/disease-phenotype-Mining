An autopsy case of Behçet disease which was considered to be typical both clinically and histopathologically was reported. Cerebral abscess was also noted. Consequently it was presumed that some of the findings which had been called softening, demyelination, cavitation among others as the lesions of Neuro-Behçet might be closely related to abscess. Besides suppurative endoaortitis which was thought to be of interest as the lesions of Vascular-Behçet was observed. In order to substantiate the above, a general review of the literature of Behçet disease was made.
