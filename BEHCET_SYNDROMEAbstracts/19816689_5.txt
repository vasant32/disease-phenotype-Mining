Infliximab has demonstrated remarkable effects on controlling uveitis in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). However, there is no way except for discontinuation of infliximab treatment in patients who are intolerant to the agent due to hypersensitivity reactions. We here report successful switching from infliximab to adalimumab in a BD patient. Treatment with infliximab had maintained clinical remission in the patient having refractory ocular lesions to cyclosporine until the patient had experienced repeated infliximab-related infusion reactions. Discontinuation of the therapy led to another ocular attacks immediately. Switching to adalimumab induced clinical remission again. Our experience suggest adalimumab is a safe and effective option for patients having hypersensitivity to infliximab.
