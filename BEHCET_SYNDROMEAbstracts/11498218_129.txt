Permanent loss of vision resulting from relapsing ocular inflammation occurs frequently in patients with Behçet's disease, despite intensive, chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Since tumour necrosis factor (TNF) might have an important pathogenetic role in Behçet's disease, we decided to give a single infusion of infliximab-a monoclonal antibody against TNF-to five patients with relapsing panuveitis, at the immediate onset of last relapse. Remission of ocular inflammation was evident within the first 24 h, and complete suppression was seen 7 days after treatment in all patients. No side-effects were noted. We suggest that infliximab is a rapid and effective new therapy for sight-threatening ocular inflammation in Behçet's disease.
