 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diagnosis and surgical treatment results of angio-Behçet syndrome. METHODS: The clinical data of pre-operation diagnosis, surgical treatment methods and prospective efficacy of 26 patients who were diagnosed as Behçet syndrome between January 2003 and April 2011 was analyzed retrospectively. There were 23 male and 3 female patients, aging from 20 to 76 years with a mean of (37 ± 6) years. Among them, 3 patients showed the clinical symptoms as arterial stenosis or occlusion, 9 patients had aneurysm, 13 patients had phlebitis or phlebothrombosis. One patient had both aneurysm and venous thrombosis. Totally 11 patients had experienced 22 cases surgical treatment including interventional therapy for 8 cases, open operation for 13 cases and hybrid operation for 1 case. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (84.6%) were followed up from 3 months to 96 months after various surgical treatment methods. The average follow-up periond was 39.3 months. Totally, perioperative mortality was 1/11 after surgical treatment. Healing rates were 7/8 and 8/13, recurrence rates were 5/8 and 7/8 in patients with interventional therapy compared with that of experiencing open surgery respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Behçet syndrome patients combined with various vascular lesions should be thought of angio-Behçet syndrome. Choosing correct surgical treatment according to patient's condition and timing of pathological changes are the keys of gaining satisfactory results.
