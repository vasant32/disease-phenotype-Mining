 OBJECTIVE: Relapsing ocular involvement is one of the major manifestations in Adamantiades-Beh√ßet's disease (ABD). Combining systemic corticosteroids with cyclosporin A is currently the treatment of choice. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has proven to be effective in mucocutaneous ABD and has been reported to improve ocular lesions. We examined the longterm effects of IFN-alpha-2a in a case series of 45 patients with ocular involvement. METHODS: Since 1988, 45 patients (79 eyes of 90 eyes) with ocular involvement in ABD have been treated with IFN-alpha (3 x 6-9 Mio IU per wk). In the initial acute phase of the disease, patients additionally received short-term corticosteroids (oral prednisolone 100 mg/day), tapered to a maintenance dose of 10 mg/day within 2 weeks. IFN-alpha-2a was administered as longterm therapy with a mean duration of 30 months (range 1.1-101 mo). RESULTS: IFN-alpha-2a/prednisolone treatment was effective against vasculitis, optic nerve neuropathy, and iritis. Sixty-four eyes had no recurrence under therapy. To date, recurrences have been seen in 26 eyes under IFN-alpha treatment. Flu-like symptoms were recorded in nearly all patients (n = 43). Further side effects were dose-dependent reversible thrombocytopenia (n = 1), psychosis (n = 3), depression (n = 13), thyroiditis (n = 1), and reversible diffuse alopecia (n = 7). In our series, 92% of all eyes showed stable or improved visual acuity in longterm followup. CONCLUSION: Longterm remission of ocular inflammation can be achieved with the combination of IFN-alpha and low-dose corticosteroids.
