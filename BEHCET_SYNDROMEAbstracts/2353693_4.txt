A 43-yr-old man with a diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome since 1977 developed esophageal aphthous ulcerations, duodenal ulcer, and pyloric stenosis. The pyloric stenosis was due to edematous hypertrophy of the pyloric ring. The evidence strongly suggested that these findings were complications of Behçet's syndrome.
