PURPOSE: Extraction of cataracts with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) implantation has been attempted with some encouraging results in uveitis having minor intensity. However, the number of operated patients is very limited. We present the results in patients having more important intensity of uveitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors studied 28 eyes in 20 patients who underwent cataract extraction as a complication of uveitis. RESULTS: All the operations were accomplished by phacoemulsification and aspiration (PER) with posterior chamber lens implanted in 23 eyes. Etiologic diagnosis included 8 sarcoidosis, 5 Beh√ßet, 3 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and 12 other aetiologies. Eighty percent of patients obtained visual acuity better than 0.6 postoperatively. Postoperative complications were not severe. CONCLUSIONS: The indication of PC-IOL could be given to cataracts in chronic uveitis if the patients are older than 35 years and there are no uveal inflammatory signs at least 3 months prior to considered implantation.
