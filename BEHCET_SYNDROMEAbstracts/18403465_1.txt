Behçet's disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by vasculitis, which affects all types and sizes of blood vessels. A thrombotic tendency with a predilection for the venous side of the vasculature is well known for Behçet's disease. However, central vein involvement is a rare complication. The authors report an unusual case of complete thrombosis of the supraazygos superior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, as well as right internal jugular vein in a patient who is a young woman with Behçet's disease.
