Behçet's disease is a systemic disease characterized by oral aphta, genital ulcer, and ocular lesion. Arterial involvement is an uncommon complication of Behçet's disease, and it most frequently affects the abdominal aorta followed by the femoral artery and the pulmonary artery. Coronary lesions in Behçet's disease have been little reported in the literature. In this communication, we present a case with coronary artery stenosis and with subsequently developed supra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The coronary lesions were revasculized with gastroepiploic artery, right internal mammary artery, and saphenous vein graft. Abdominal aortic repair was performed with partial cardiopulmonary stand by, because of the risk of coronary ischemia during the cross clamp including the celiac artery. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful repair of combined lesions of the coronary and the abdominal aorta in a patient with Behçet's disease.
