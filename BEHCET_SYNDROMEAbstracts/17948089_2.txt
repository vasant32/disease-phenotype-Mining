Aortic arch aneurysm, pseudocoarctation, and coronary artery stenosis are extremely rare in Behçet's syndrome. We present the case of a 25-year-old man with Behçet's syndrome who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting for severe stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and concomitant surgical correction of a saccular aneurysm that was causing pseudocoarctation of the aortic arch. The surgery was successful.
