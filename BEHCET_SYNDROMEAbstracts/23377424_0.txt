 OBJECTIVE: To study the neuroimaging findings of neuro-Behcet`s disease (NBD) in Saudi patients and to discuss the radiological differential diagnosis. METHODS: The clinical data and radiological findings on CT, MRI and cerebral angiography of 16 patients with NBD attending King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, from January 1990 to February 2003 were reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 16 patients with NBD, 11 patients (68.75%) had cerebral venous thrombosis predominantly involving superior sagittal sinus causing intracranial hypertension, while 5 patients (31.25%) had symptoms and signs related to brain parenchymal involvement predominantly affecting brainstem. CONCLUSION: Pattern of distribution of brain parenchymal lesions in NBD might help to differentiate it from other vasculitides as well as from demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis.  Cerebral venous thrombosis is a common manifestation of NBD.
