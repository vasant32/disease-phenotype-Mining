 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The highest prevalence of Behçet's disease (BD) has been reported in Turkey, and therefore research of relations between BD and other disorders have become important in the Turkish population. Since oral aphthous ulcers impair tooth brushing, reducing complaints about aphthous ulcers will motivate the patient to maintain better oral hygiene performance and will thus reduce plaque accumulation and periodontal scores. The purpose of this controlled case study was to evaluate the relationship between the severity of periodontal scores and Behçet's disease, and to compare the treatment modalities with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser and medication on the recurrent aphthous ulcers in BD patients by considering the degree of pre- and post-treatment pain, discomfort and functional complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The periodontal status of 28 BD patients was evaluated according to periodontal indices. The BD patients were also assessed for clinical severity score as described previously. Levels of pre- and post-treatment pain and functional complications were assessed at patient visits on days 1, 4 and 7. RESULTS: Periodontal indices, the number of oral ulcers and the daily frequency of tooth brushing were related to the severity scores of BD (p < 0.001). The results indicated that BD patients treated with the Nd:YAG laser had less post-treatment pain and fewer functional complications and reported immediate relief of pain and faster healing (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that periodontal status is worse in BD patients and is associated with disease severity; also, the Nd:YAG laser has better patient acceptance, shorter treatment time and lower rates of pain and post-treatment adverse events among BD patients with oral recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
