We report the case of a 32-year-old man with new diagnosed Behcet's disease (BD) with cardiac, central nervous system and vascular involvement. Transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a thrombus in the right ventricle and another thrombus in the inferior vena cava (IVC). The color Doppler imaging was compatible with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed atrophy of brain stem and right hemisphere and a milimmetric lacunar infarct. Although therapy with urokinase, pulse methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide was administered immediately, the patient died due to hepatic failure. BD should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of thromboses in the young and thrombotic events should be evaluated during the clinical course of BD.
