This study aimed to determine plasma and neutrophil oxidase activities that may contribute to vascular inflammation in Beh√ßet's disease (BD) patients. Cyclooxygenase (COX), NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was determined in neutrophils isolated from BD patients and healthy controls. Functional assay of NADPH oxidase was significantly increased in BD patients, both at basal conditions and in response to fMLP stimulation. There was a significant increase in plasma MPO activity in the disease group as compared to controls. Total COX activity was significantly increased in BD neutrophils. The increase in total COX activity was accompanied with enhanced activity of COX-2, differentiated by using the COX-1 isoform-specific inhibitor SC-560. Neutrophil nitrate/nitrite levels showed no significant difference in BD; however, plasma nitrate/nitrite contents in BD patients were significantly greater compared to controls. In conclusion, increased plasma MPO, neutrophil NADPH and COX activities may contribute to intravascular inflammation documented in BD patients.
