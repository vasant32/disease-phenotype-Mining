The result of pars plana vitrectomy in Behçet's syndrome has been investigated in patients with vitreous hemorrhage and condensation. Surgery was performed in seven cases. All of the patients became more hypotonic after surgery, and phthisis developed in less than two years. It is suggested that pars plana vitrectomy should not be performed in Behçet's patients.
