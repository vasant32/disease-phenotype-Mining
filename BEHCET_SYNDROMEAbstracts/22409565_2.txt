 PURPOSE: To evaluate demographic, clinical, and ocular features of patients with late-onset Beh√ßet disease (BD). METHODS: The study included 26 patients with late-onset BD. Onset of their first symptoms was before age 40. They fulfilled the diagnostic criteria after age 40. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 had uveitis and group 2 had no uveitis. Clinical and demographic features of the groups were compared. Ocular manifestations in group 1 were also evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (53.8%) had uveitis and 12 patients (46.2%) had no ocular involvement. The incidence of genital ulcer was higher in group 1. Twelve patients (18 eyes) had anterior uveitis and 2 patients (4 eyes) had panuveitis. The incidence of anterior uveitis was higher in females. The incidence of panuveitis was higher in males. CONCLUSIONS: As compared to potentially devastating posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis is more often encountered in patients with late-onset BD. Hence, with respect to ocular involvement, the prognosis is better.
