Behcet syndrome is a systemic disease with venous tropism, generally expressed by thrombosis and phlebitis. Arterial involvement is more exceptional but can lead to aneurysm of the pulmonary artery, generally not more than three. We report a patient with Behcet syndrome who developed multiple aneurysms of the pulmonary artery and discuss the clinical, radiological aspects as well as the disease course and therapeutic management.
