Behçet's disease is a multisystem disorder in which urogenital involvement mainly consists of genital aphthous ulcers, epididymitis, urethritis and recurrent cystitis. Colchicine is commonly used in these patients for the prevention of arthritic episodes. In this prospective study, 62 male patients under colchicine therapy for Behçet's disease underwent a complete urogenital evaluation. 33 (53.2%) had no urologic complaints. Physical examination revealed genital aphthous ulcers in 42 patients (67.7%) and epididymitis in 5 (8.1%). Analysis of urine specimens demonstrated proteinuria in 54.8% and hematuria in 30.6%. To establish any possible adverse effects of colchicine administration on male fertility, sperm analysis was performed: 23 patients (37.1%) had oligonecrospermia, 2 patients (3.2%) had azoospermia. Penile color flow Doppler sonography revealed arterial insufficiency in 17 patients (27.4%). Other urological findings were interpreted as coincidental. Our results indicate that urologic manifestations of Behçet's disease, and especially the possible adverse effects of colchicine administration on the reproductive potential of the treated patients should be carefully monitored.
