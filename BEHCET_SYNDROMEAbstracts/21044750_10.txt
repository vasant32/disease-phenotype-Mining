 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The risks of insulin resistance and accelerated atherosclerosis are increased in chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Adipo-(cyto)kines are associated with insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and inflammation. This study aimed to determine serum adiponectin and vaspin levels and their associations with the predictors of atherosclerosis in RA and Behcet's disease (BD). METHODS: The study involved 56 patients with RA, 37 patients with BD, and 29 healthy controls (HC). Serum adiponectin and vaspin levels, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, and common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were determined. RESULTS: Serum adiponectin levels in both patient groups and serum vaspin level in only the RA group were higher, whereas serum vaspin level was lower in the active BD subgroup, compared to the HC group. However, adiponectin and vaspin levels were correlated with neither HOMA-IR index nor IMT in the RA group. Adiponectin level was correlated with DAS-28 and IL-6 level in the RA group, and it was higher in the active BD subgroup than in the inactive BD subgroup and the HC group. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin and vaspin levels are higher in RA but associated with neither HOMA-IR index nor IMT. Adiponectin is related with disease activity remarks in RA and BD. Therefore, it may be suggested that adiponectin may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses in inflammatory diseases. Moreover, in contrast to in RA, vaspin level declines in active BD, and these results suggest that different chronic inflammatory diseases exert different influences on either adipokines.
