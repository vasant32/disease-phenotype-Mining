AIMS/BACKGROUND: To assess the outcome and complications of cataract extraction in patients with Behçet's disease. METHODS: Thirty-six Behçet's disease patients underwent cataract surgery without intraocular lens implantation. Twenty-six patients had phacoemulsification or extracapsular cataract extraction, and ten patients had pars plana lensectomy/vitrectomy. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 84 months (mean, 38 months). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the follow-up period of patients who underwent phacoemulsification, extracapsular cataract extraction, or pars plana lensectomy/vitrectomy. Sixteen (62%) of 26 patients who had extracapsular cataract extraction or phacoemulsification had a visual acuity of 20/200 or better compared with none of the 10 patients who had pars plana lensectomy/vitrectomy. Three (30%) of ten eyes which underwent pars plana lensectomy/vitrectomy eventuated in phthisis bulbi while none of the eyes that underwent extracapsular cataract extraction or phacoemulsification developed phthisis bulbi. CONCLUSION: Extracapsular cataract extraction or phacoemulsification had a better visual outcome and fewer postoperative complications than pars plana lensectomy/vitrectomy in patients with Behçet's disease.
