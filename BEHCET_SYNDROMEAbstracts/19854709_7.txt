 OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel serum biomarker of disease activity in inflammatory autoimmune disorders. METHODS: Sera obtained from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients before and after anti-TNF therapy were analysed by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) quantitative proteomic analysis and further validated by ELISA. RESULTS: Of 326 proteins identified by proteomic analysis, increased serum levels of leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) was identified in RA patients before therapy. Serum LRG concentrations were significantly elevated in RA patients compared with healthy controls and decreased after anti-TNF therapy. Furthermore, serum LRG concentrations correlated with disease activity in RA and Crohn's disease (CD). Interestingly, in a subpopulation of patients with active CD and normal C-reactive protein levels, serum LRG concentrations were elevated. CONCLUSIONS: LRG represents a novel serum biomarker for monitoring disease activity during therapy in autoimmune patients, particularly useful in patients with active disease but normal CRP levels.
