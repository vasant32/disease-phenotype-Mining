A 29-year-old man and a 36-year-old man developed attacks of acute neuro-Beh√ßet's disease (NB) (right Horner's syndrome and right hemiplegia and dysarthria, respectively) during the course of chronic progressive NB (acute on chronic). Although both patients recovered from acute NB after treatment with infliximab or corticosteroids, they continued to show manifestations of chronic progressive NB. It is suggested that acute NB and chronic progressive NB are different in their pathogenesis.
