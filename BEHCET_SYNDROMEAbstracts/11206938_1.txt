Dermographism is the appearance of whealing and erythema within minutes in a site where skin has been exposed to pressure or mechanical irritation. In our clinical observations, dermographism seems to be frequent in patients with Behçet's disease. Since the prevalence of allergic responses is reportedly increased in vasculitic syndromes, we aimed to assess dermographism and atopy in a group of Behçet's patients. The study group comprised 30 consecutive patients with Behçet's disease. The study was carried out in two parts: elicited dermographism and atopy tests. In the first part, dermographism was investigated in the study group (Behçet's patients) and 230 healthy controls. In the second part, the study group, 30 healthy controls and 17 patients with allergic bronchial asthma were evaluated for specific and nonspecific atopy. Dermographism was found to be increased in patients with Behçet's disease. Peripheral blood eosinophil count, serum total IgE and nasal eosinophil scores were similar in patients with Behçet's disease and healthy controls. Although blood eosinophil count and serum total IgE levels were higher in allergic bronchial asthma patients than in Behçet's patients, the difference was significant only in the former. Skin prick test was positive in three of the patients with Behçet's disease and in six healthy controls. The difference was statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). None of the Behçet's disease patients had pathergy or a pathergy-like reaction at the site of the skin prick test after 48 h. In conclusion, our results confirm the general impression that dermographism is common in patients suffering from Behçet's disease.
