A case of neuro-Behcet's syndrome is presented with sequential positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and oxygen consumption (rCMRO2) were decreased in the brain lesion; however, on follow-up studies 3 months after steroid therapy rCBF and rCMRO2 had increased in the lesion, which demonstrated the reversibility of this disease. Such monitored improvement may accurately reflect the early stage of the disease and its response to steroid therapy.
