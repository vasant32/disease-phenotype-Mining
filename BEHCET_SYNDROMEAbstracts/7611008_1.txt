The early phase reaction of neutrophil chemotaxis (polarization) was studied in 47 cases with Behçet's disease and 24 cases with sarcoidosis by polarization assay. 53 normal subjects served as controls. The titer of polarization in Behçet's disease was significantly higher than in the controls (p < 0.05, t-test). The titer of the active stage was significantly higher than in the controls (p < 0.05), but there was no difference in the titers between the inactive stage and the controls. The age, the sex, type of disease, and colchicine did not influence the titers. The titer of polarization in sarcoidosis, however, was significantly lower in both the active and inactive stages than in the controls and the inactive stage of Behçet's disease (p < 0.05). There was no difference in the titers between each stage. In Behçet's disease, neutrophil chemotaxis may be activated, whereas it may be suppressed or disturbed in sarcoidosis. Polarization assay is an excellent method for detecting neutrophil polarization in Behçet's disease and is useful to make a differential diagnosis between Behçet's disease and sarcoidosis. In the etiology and pathology of these diseases, neutrophils may play an opposite role.
