A thirty-six year old male with a sixteen month history of a progressive neurological disorder had Behcet's disease. His initial electroencephalogram showed periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). The electroencephalographic changes in this disorder have not been described in detail in the American literature. The review of world publications in this matter disclosed that there is no specific EEG pattern in this condition, and that electroencephalographic changes are mainly related to the side of the lesion and have no prognostic value.
