Forty-six cases of Behcet's disease were randomly divided into two groups. The 26 cases in the treatment group were treated by acupuncture and the 20 cases in the control group with the drugs. The level of L-chain (kappa) of IgM and the level of the trace element Zn were determined before and after treatment in the treatment group. The results showed that the recurrence rate in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01), and the differences in the level of L-chain (kappa) of IgM and level of Zn in the treatment group before and after treatment were very significant (P < 0.01). These two indexes tended to become normal after treatment.
