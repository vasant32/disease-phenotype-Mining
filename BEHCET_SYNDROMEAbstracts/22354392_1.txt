 OBJECTIVE: To investigate and describe the long-term outcome of venous thrombosis in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 807 BD patients, a reported 296 patients (36.7%) (73.3% male, median age 30 years [interquartile range 24-36 years]) met the international classification criteria for BD and had venous thrombosis. We assessed factors associated with thrombosis relapse and mortality. RESULTS: There were a total of 586 venous thrombosis events, including 560 cases of deep thrombosis and 26 cases of superficial thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosis events included 323 cases of limb thrombosis (55.1%), 77 cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (13.1%), 57 cases of pulmonary embolism (9.7%), 63 cases of vena cava lesions (10.7%), 14 cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome (2.4%), and 13 cases of cervical vein thrombosis (2.2%). One hundred of 296 patients (33.8%) experienced at least 1 venous thrombosis relapse. The mortality rate was 6.4% (19 of 296 patients) after a median followup of 4.75 years (interquartile range 2-7 years). In univariate analysis, death was associated with cardiac involvement (P = 0.026) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, the use of immunosuppressive agents was found to prevent relapse of venous thrombosis (hazard ratio 0.27 [95% confidence interval 0.14-0.52], P = 0.00021), and there was a trend toward prevention of relapse with the use of glucocorticoids (hazard ratio 0.62 [95% confidence interval 0.40-0.97], P = 0.058). CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressive agents significantly reduce venous thrombosis relapse in BD.
