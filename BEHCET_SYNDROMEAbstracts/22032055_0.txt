 BACKGROUND: The impact of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) on the vascular bed is highly important, as this condition may lead to heart failure from asymptomatic systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Our aim was to evaluate diastolic functions using new echocardiographic parameters and the correlation of these parameters with atrial electrocardiographic (ECG) indices in patients with BD. METHODS: 31 patients with BD and 31 healthy control subjects were enrolled to this study. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic functions were examined with conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography. P-wave dispersion (PD) was calculated by measuring minimum and maximum P-wave duration values on the 12-lead surface ECG. The relationship between PD and echocardiographic parameters of diastolic dysfunction were investigated. RESULTS: The mitral inflow E/A ratio and diastolic myocardial velocity ratio (Em/Am) were lower in the BD group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The E/Em ratio and left atrial volume index (LAVi) were higher in the BD group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.014, respectively) compared to healthy control subjects. P max and PD were significantly higher in the BD group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). PD correlated positively with the duration of BD. Also, PD correlated positively with LAVi and E/Em ratio, but negatively with E/A and Em/Am ratios. CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated that LV diastolic functions are impaired in BD patients. Furthermore, P-wave abnormalities were demonstrated in BD patients and there was a significant correlation between PD and diastolic dysfunction.
