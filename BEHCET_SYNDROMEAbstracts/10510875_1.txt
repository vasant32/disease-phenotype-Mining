To evaluate the value of nuclear medicine procedures in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal involvement of Behcet's disease in asymptomatic patients, Tc-99m human immunoglobulin (HIG) and Tc-99m leucocyte (LC) whole body scintigraphies were performed on 30 patients with major symptoms of the disease. Comparison of the results with other diagnostic techniques showed that Tc-99m HIG whole body scanning can be a useful diagnostic aid before the disease becomes clinically active in the gastrointestinal system.
