Among 16 cases clinicaly diagnosed as Adamantiadès-Behçet syndrome coming from various areas of Northern Greece, antigen HLA-B5 was found on 12, i.e. 75% instead of 18,5% in the normal population of the same areas (200 subjects were examined by Dr. Z. Polymenidis in this thesis). On 3 other cases the antigen found was HLA-BW35 (belonging to group C4), while on the last one the antigen was HLA-B27. 4 cases, suspicious for atypical Adamantiadès-Behçet syndrome, are reported in which the discovery of antigen HLA-B5 inhanced the clinical diagnosis of the syndrome and made possible the early application of suitable treatment (steroids, immunosupressors).
