BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a chronic multisystem condition of unknown origin. Genitourinary tract involvement with genital apthous ulcers, epididymitis, urethritis and recurrent cystitis is encountered commonly. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to neural involvement of the syndrome, has been reported extremely rarely. METHODS: A case of neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to Behcet's disease is presented. The patient was 17-year-old young male with a long history of the disease and neurological affection, but with neglected lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary incontinence. The patient was diagnosed urodynamically to have hyperreflexic detrusor. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: After failure of medical treatment (oxybutynin chloride) the patient submitted to augmentation clam-type sigmoidocystoplasty. Four years postoperatively, the patient is dry, on clean intermittent self catheterization twice daily and he is practically asymptomatic from lower urinary tract symptoms.
