We report a case of a 27-year-old man who presented with an acute myocardial infarction. When he was hospitalized one month later to evaluate this recent event, he developed clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of Adamantiadis-Beh√ßet's syndrome. We believe that the myocardial infarction was due to coronary arteritis, because there were no risk factors for coronary disease present.
