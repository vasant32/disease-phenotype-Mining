Ten patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy, six with isolated retinal vasculitis and eight with Beh√ßet's disease were treated with cyclosporine for one to three years. Autoantibodies to several retinal proteins, circulating lymphocyte subsets and cellular reactivity to S-antigen were evaluated repeatedly during this period. Autoantibody titers were similar in patients and in controls. However the serum content of antibodies to IRBP or S-antigen was lessened during inflammatory periods in some patients. In some sera, antibodies reacted with enzyme digested S-antigen preparations by immunoblot, whereas the same sera were negative for the native protein. A decrease of the CD4+ subpopulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes was associated with relapses of ocular inflammation in birdshot retinochoroidopathy. In this disease and in idiopathic retinal vasculitis, the positive lymphocyte stimulation test and basophil degranulation test with S-antigen were significantly most frequent in the period preceding a relapse of ocular inflammation. These tests could therefore be of predictive value for relapses occurring within the next few months.
