Behçet's syndrome is described on the basis of historical facts taken exclusively from original papers, and considering especially those symptoms which are usually neglected. The differentiation of certain symptom-oriented subforms such as angio-Behçet, arthro-Behçet, entero-Behçet, neuro-Behçet, pneumo-Behçet, and uro-Behçet gives a better understanding of this syndrome and also stresses the fact that many fields of medical activity are concerned with it. The historical facts show that ophthalmology and dermatology share the credit for having identified this syndrome.
