 PURPOSE: To determine the outcome of initial trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) in the management of secondary glaucoma associated with Beh√ßet disease (BD) in a 1-year follow-up period. METHODS: Twenty-three eyes of 13 cases with secondary glaucoma associated with BD, were evaluated prospectively. They underwent primary trabeculectomy with MMC. The operative success was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) < or =20 mm Hg (+/- medical therapy) in the absence of phthisis and without the necessity of further surgery for glaucoma and success rates at the postoperative first day, first month, sixth month, and first year were determined. RESULTS: Success was achieved in all of the eyes (100%) at the postoperative first day and month, in 21 eyes (91.3%) at the postoperative sixth month and in 19 eyes (82.6%) at the postoperative first year. The mean preoperative IOP was 30.9+/-5.3 mm Hg under the mean 3.3+/-0.7 antiglaucoma medications but it reduced to 16.8+/-3.1 mm Hg under the mean 1.7+/-0.8 medications at the postoperative sixth month and 18.5+/-3.2 mm Hg under the mean 2.6+/-1.1 medications at the postoperative first year. CONCLUSIONS: Trabeculectomy with MMC provides reduction of IOP and the number of antiglaucoma medications in cases with secondary glaucoma associated with BD in a 1-year follow-up period.
