We report the case of a 62-year-old man with Behçet's disease revealed by double aneurysmal involvement of the posterior tibial and popliteal arteries. The diagnosis was suggested because of repeated phlebitis, buccal aphthous ulcerations, and results of human leukocyte antigen gene typing. The different arguments leading to the diagnosis of Behçet's disease and appropriate treatment are presented.
