A 46-year-old black female with a history of Behçet's Disease was admitted with a diagnosis of abdominal pain. She had complained of palpitations, diaphoresis, anxiety, and fatigue for years which had been variously attributed to the perimenopause and her Behçet's. During her hospital evaluation, she had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia associated with severely elevated blood pressure. Subsequent evaluation revealed a large pararenal mass which was found to be a pheochromocytoma. Search of six databases revealed this to be only the second case report in the English literature of a pheochromocytoma in association with Behçet's Disease.
