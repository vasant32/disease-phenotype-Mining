 PURPOSE: To report our experience with a rare and interesting subset of Behcet's disease (BD) patients with the aneurysm formation type of angio BD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1988 to 2003, five cases of the aneurysm formation type of BD were found amongst patients in Queen Alia Cardiac Center and Queen Alia Hospital Vascular Surgery Unit, Amman, Jordan. A retrospective study of the case notes and imaging was carried out. The clinical features, management modes and outcomes are elucidated. RESULTS: All five male patients had diagnostic features of BD. Two patients (40%) presented with acute aneurysm rupture and underwent operative procedures which lead to the death of both in the perioperative period. Three patients (60%) underwent elective aneurysm repair complicated by graft thrombosis in one and recurrent aneurysm formation in another. CONCLUSION: Our data confirms previous reports of the high mortality and morbidity of the aneurysm type of angio BD and the poor outcome of surgical interventions. Careful postoperative follow up for recurrent aneurysm formation and thrombosis is mandatory.
