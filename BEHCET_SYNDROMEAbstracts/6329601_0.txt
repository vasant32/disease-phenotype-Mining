Studies were made on neutrophil dysfunction in Beh√ßet disease by examining collagenolytic activity in neutrophils. The collagenolytic activity of neutrophil was found to be significantly higher in patients during the attack phase of this disease than in patients during the remission phase, in patients with other forms of uveitis and in normal controls. Collagenase was present in the collagenolytic enzyme, which showed high activity in the attack phase. The molecular weight of this enzyme was similar to that of mammalian neutrophil collagenase.
