Thalidomide alone (200-300 mg daily) or associated with colchicine (2-3 mg daily) was given orally to 25 patients with aphthosis: 8 patients with recurrent oral aphthae; 4 patients with recurrent mucocutaneous aphthosis, without visceral involvement, and 13 patients with Behçet's disease (Touraine's aphthosis). A major improvement was noted in all groups, with a rapid healing of mucous lesions and a rapid reduction of pain and burning as compared to prior spontaneous regressions. No new outbreaks were noted at a dose of 50-100 mg thalidomide and 1 mg colchicine daily. Under oral administration of the drugs, thrombophlebitis was noted in 1 case (third group) only. In the other patients with Behçet's disease, skin aphthae, ocular symptoms, arthritis, superficial nodular phlebitis quickly disappeared with treatment. The efficiency of the drugs is only temporary, since new lesions usually appeared a few weeks after the end of treatment. Due to the relatively small number of cases studied in each group, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the efficiency of thalidomide alone compared to the association of the two drugs. However, this open trial does support the usefulness of thalidomide, or thalidomide and colchicine, in recurrent mucocutaneous aphthae, aphthosis and Behçet's disease.
