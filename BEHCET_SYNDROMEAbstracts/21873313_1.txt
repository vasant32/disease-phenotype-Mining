 BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) genes have recently been reported to be associated with the susceptibility to several immune-related diseases. This study was conducted to examine the association of CCR6 with Behçet's disease (BD) in two Chinese Han populations. METHODS: A total of 473 patients with BD and 725 healthy controls from two Chinese Han populations were genotyped by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the χ(2) test. Genotype frequencies were estimated by direct counting. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using the χ(2) test. RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequencies of rs3093024, rs6902119, rs3093023 and rs2301436 were not different between patients with BD and healthy controls. Analysis according to gender and clinical findings including oral ulcer, genital ulcer, skin lesions and arthritis did not show any association of the four tested polymorphisms with these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The tested CCR6 gene polymorphisms are not associated with the susceptibility to BD in the tested Chinese Han populations.
