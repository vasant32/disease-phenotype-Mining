The aim of the current study is to situate CDs expression (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) and their relationship with IFNγ and NO production in Algerian patients with Behçet disease (n = 34 ). Our results revealed an elevated expression of T cells markers tested in patients in active stage of the disease in relation to IFNγ and NO increase levels. Most interestingly, we noted that CD4+/CD8+ expression correlated with IFNγ and NO production in active stage. In contrast, we observed a decrease of these mediators in inactive stage. Collectively, our results indicate a dependent relation between these parameters and inflammatory response associated with the evolutionary stage of the disease.
