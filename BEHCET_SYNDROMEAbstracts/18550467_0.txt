Adhesion molecules have a role in many vasculitic disorders. Our aim was to evaluate the status of adhesion molecules in nodular lesions of Beh√ßet syndrome (BS) and compare them with results for the 2 most common types of panniculitis, erythema nodosum (EN) and nodular vasculitis (NV). We included the data for 28 patients with nodular lesions of BS, 24 with EN, and 22 with NV. A panel of monoclonal antibodies against E-selectin, P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 were applied. The distribution and intensity of adhesion molecules were assessed. There were no statistically significant differences between the BS and control groups in regard to these adhesion molecules except for ICAM-1. The percentage of strongly ICAM-1-stained endothelial cells in subcutaneous fat tissue in relation to the total number of endothelial cells was the lowest in BS (P= .0208). Because many lesions of BS were related to an enhanced inflammatory response, the lower percentage of ICAM-1 expression seems counterintuitive.
