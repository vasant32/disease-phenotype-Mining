Epidemiological studies demonstrate a prevalence of Adamantiades-Beh√ßets disease (MAB) in the range of 0.12-420 per 100,000 inhabitants with the highest rates in Istanbul, Turkey and the lowest rates in the USA. Ophthalmological data on the prevalence of ocular involvement are limited for MAB in Germany because most epidemiological studies are based on rheumatological or dermatological data. Berlin is the city with the highest number of non-native German inhabitants and its multiethnic character renders it uniquely appropriate for epidemiological studies on MAB. This article summarizes the most important epidemiological data of 140 patients (63 female and 77 male) with a mean follow-up of 6.4 years (range 0.5-22 years) which we have recently published. The mean age was 23 years at the first manifestation and 32 years when the fully developed disease was recorded. The mean age at onset of ocular involvement was 30 years, 56% of patients developed ocular involvement, which was the first manifestation in 8.6% and the second manifestation in 19.3%. More than half the patients developed ocular involvement. The calculated prevalence of ocular involvement in MAB is 1.77/100,000 inhabitants for the population of Berlin.
