 PURPOSE: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology with complicated and diversified clinical features predominantly involving oral and genital ulcers, and ocular and cutaneous lesions. The clinical features of this disease have been described to be different according to geographical areas and gender. We investigated the specific clinical features of BD patients in Northeastern China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 116 patients involved in this study fulfilled the classification criteria of the International Study Group for BD. The clinical manifestations and results of laboratory tests of BD were recorded in each patient. RESULTS: The onset was typically between 20-39 years with a slight female predominance. Oral ulcers were the most common manifestation, followed by skin lesions, positive pathergy reaction/genital ulcers, and ocular lesions. Vascular lesion and epididymitis were rare in patients with BD. The frequency of erythema nodosum-like lesion and articular involvement were significantly higher in females, while gastrointestinal involvement was significantly higher in males. The results of laboratory tests showed that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 alleles were positive in 30.9% of patients and the immunological abnormities were present in some patients. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of BD showed geographical and gender difference. Genetic and immune factors might participate in aetiopathogenesis of BD.
