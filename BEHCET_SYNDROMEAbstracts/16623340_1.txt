A 25-year-old woman was admitted after having had a fever for one month, headache, nausea, vomiting, dysarthria and right-sided hemiparesis. A 35-year-old man was admitted because of severe loss of vision and a history of focal retinochoroiditis. Both were suffering from Behçet's disease. Behçet's disease can present with systemic symptoms that might be related to aberrant T-cell functions. It is treated with a variety of immunoregulatory drugs. Recently, treatment with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-inhibiting molecular designed drugs such as infliximab or etanercept has improved the therapeutic prospective of Behçet patients. Both of the patients described above developed refractory disease and responded to treatment with these new drugs.
