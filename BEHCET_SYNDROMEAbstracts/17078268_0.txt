Arterial involvement in Behçet's disease is rare. It represents one of the fashions of expression of this pathology. We report an observation of a 32-year-old man who was hospitalised for an intense abdominal pain. Doppler ultrasound and computed angiography showed a superior mesenteric artery aneurysm. The patient was operated in urgency and operating suites were simple. The etiologic inquiry of this aneurysm ended in the diagnosis of Behçet disease. The result underline the need to search for Behçet's disease in all cases of arterial involvement in young patient. The treatment of the aneurysm should not be delayed.
