Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction may be dynamic, most commonly associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and, uncommonly, by congenital anomalies such as discrete subaortic stenosis. We describe a patient with Beh√ßet's disease, presenting with a systolic murmur, fever, and syncope, in whom a diagnosis of subaortic obstruction caused by a pseudo-aneurysm dissecting the interventricular septum and associated with a complete atrioventricular block was made.
