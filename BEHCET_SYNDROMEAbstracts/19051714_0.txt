Behçet's disease (BD) is a multi-system inflammatory disorder which presents with recurrent orogenital ulceration, uveitis, and erythema nodosum. Medium vessel vasculitis of upper limb is extremely rare and it is only reported in patients with Behçet's disease on long follow up. Mean duration from diagnosis of disease to development of vasculitis is 5.8 years. We present a patient who presented with gangrene of fingers with absent radial pulse and during course of his illness he developed features of Behçet's disease.
