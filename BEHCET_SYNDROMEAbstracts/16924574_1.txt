Intracardiac thrombus and pulmonary embolism is a very rare manifestation of Behçet's disease. A twenty-years-old man was admitted to hospital due to dyspnea, haemoptysis, fever and partially loss of vision. On dynamic thorax computed tomography (CT), there was aneurysmatic dilatation and thrombus in bilateral pulmonary artery segments and also findings of pulmonary thromboembolism. A diagnosis of Behçet's disease was made based on his clinical course and radiological findings. During treatment, the patient was admitted two times to the hospital because of recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. At the 10th months of follow up, partially dissolution of the thrombi and pulmonary defects were observed and right ventricular thrombus was revealed by dynamic thorax CT. On a follow up period of 16 months the patient is still under treatment and doing well. We present this case because Behçet's disease is a rarely considered cause of recurrent pulmonary embolism and intracardiac thrombus which is seen under treatment.
