Behçet's syndrome has to our knowledge not been described hitherto in Greenland Eskimos. A life-threatening case of Behçet's syndrome is described in a 22-year-old female Eskimo. Ulceration and scar formation in the oral and hypopharyngeal cavity were the main clinical manifestations. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and high-dose prednisone appeared effective.
