The HLA typing profile of 26 Israeli subjects with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) was examined and compared with that of 100 healthy control subjects. HLA-B51 was found in six subjects (23%) with RAS and in nine control subjects (9%) (p < 0.05). HLA-Cw7 was found in six subjects with RAS (23%) and in five control subjects (5%) (p < 0.01). Eleven subjects had first-degree relatives who had RAS. Because a high frequency of HLA-B51 has been found in Behcet's syndrome and aphthous stomatitis is part of this syndrome, it is suggested that in some subjects with RAS the entire syndrome may actually develop in the future.
