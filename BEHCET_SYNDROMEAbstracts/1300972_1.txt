BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is rare in children and is exceptionally revealed by thrombophlebitis at this age of life. CASE REPORT: A girl, aged 13 years, was admitted after having suffered from thrombophlebitis of the right leg for 6 weeks. Her medical history included frequent attacks of aphthous stomatitis and conjunctivitis and one episode of iritis. At admission, thrombophlebitis with venous thrombosis was confirmed by Doppler; it was associated with aphthous gingivitis and two similar erosive lesions in the genital area. Technetium 99 perfusion scintiphotography revealed a right pulmonary embolism. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated but there was no change in coagulation factors or immunologic abnormalities, except for the presence of immune complexes and increased complement C3 component. Biopsy of the skin lesions showed vascularitis. There was no involvement of the eyes. The condition progressively improved with anticoagulant treatment for 1 year, followed by low doses of acetylsalicylic acid. CONCLUSION: Phlebothrombosis, a classic complication of Behçet's disease in adults, revealed the disease in this girl. Its mechanism remains unclear and duration of anticoagulant treatment is still debated.
