Behçet's disease is recognised as a chronic multisystem disorder with vasculitis as its underlying pathological process. Cardiac involvement is rare and often associated with poor prognosis. A case of a 33 year old man with Behçet's disease, presenting with a large right ventricle and right atrial thrombus, is reported. Two dimensional (cross sectional), colour Doppler, and transoesophageal echocardiography, angiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to diagnose the disease. With cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone treatment, the cardiac lesions progressively resolved.
