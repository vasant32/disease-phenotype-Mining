The positivity of pathergy's test in Behçet disease varies throughout the world. We tried to evaluate its diagnostic significance in known Behçet patients in the region of North Jordan. Twenty-two patients were tested, readings were taken after 48 hours. The patients were not tested previously and a comparison between the subcutaneous injection of 0.1 ml normal saline and skin puncture was recorded. The development of a skin eruption (papule, nodule, pustule) were observed and described. The percentage of positivity was 20% in the studied population. The patients tested who were not taking medication at the time of the procedure are more likely to illustrate a positive Pathergy reaction.
