 INTRODUCTION: We present our experience with surgical treatment of arterial complications in Behcet disease (vasculo-Behcet disease), and the long-term results and pitfalls of surgical treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1990 and January 2003, 20 consecutive patients underwent surgery to treat vasculo-Behcet disease. Most patients (17 of 20) were men, with mean age of 38.4 years. RESULTS: Thirty-four operations were performed in 20 patients. The operative mortality rate was 5.8% (2 patients). There were 17 emergency operations, 6 because of ruptured primary abdominal aneurysms. There were five others with critical limb ischemia, resulting in 3 amputations. All patients were followed up postoperatively on average for 44 months (range, 6 months-14 years). Two additional patients were lost to follow-up. After the initial operation 10-year survival rate was 30%, 10-year complication-free survival rate was 13%, and 5-year repeat operation-free survival rate was 26%. CONCLUSION: Although surgical intervention should be postponed until active inflammation has subsided, often this is not possible, because of the emergent nature of these problems. Most arterial complications of vasculo-Behcet disease present with a pseudoaneurysm rupture or with impending rupture. An aggressive surgical approach can be life-saving in such instances, and should be undertaken regardless of long-term complications, which are more common when the operation is performed in the presence of active inflammation. Early and late results can be improved by individualizing, selecting a disease-free area for reconstruction, and eliminating use of autologous graft material.
