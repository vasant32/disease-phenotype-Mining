OBJECTIVE: Antikinectin autoantibody has recently been identified as a potential biomarker in Behçet's disease (BD). Here, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) for detecting this antibody. The clinical significance of antikinectin was investigated. METHODS: Partial or full-length cloning for human kinectin in prokaryotic or eukaryotic system was carried out. Three fragments covered kinectin coding sequence were used to establish ELISA. Full-length kinectin overexpressed HepG2 cells were used as a substrate for IFA. Serum samples from BD (n = 46), systemic lupus erythematosus SLE, n = 16), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 160, ankylosing spondylitis (AS, n = 14), primary Sjörgen syndrome (pSS, n = 12), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, n = 8), and healthy donors (n = 51) were examined. RESULTS: Good measurement consistency between IFA and ELISA (p < 0.001) and previous immunoprecipitation assay (p = 0.011) was found. Antikinectin was found not only in 32.6% (IFA) to 41.3% (ELISA) BD patients but was also identified in pSS, SLE, MCTD, and RA with prevalence ranging from 12.5% to 25%. Nevertheless, the titer of antikinectin (ELISA) is statistically higher in BD compared to other autoimmune connective tissue diseases (p = 0.0286). Antikinectin was found exclusively among complete form of BD (p < 0.001), but there was no correlation with specific clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the previous observation that antikinectin is related to BD, especially in the complete form of disease. The specificity and predictive values are moderate.
