AIMS: The present report was aimed at finding out whether gammaglobulin could have a role in treating ocular Beh√ßet's disease (BD) refractory to accepted medical therapy. METHODS: Six eyes of four patients with ocular BD refractory to steroids and cyclosporin A were treated with a course of intravenous gammaglobulin and followed up for their response to treatment. RESULTS: All six eyes of all four patients showed good response to gammaglobulin therapy. CONCLUSION: Gamma globulin may have a role in treating refractory ocular BD. A wide range of controlled studies with longer follow up is needed to substantiate this impression.
