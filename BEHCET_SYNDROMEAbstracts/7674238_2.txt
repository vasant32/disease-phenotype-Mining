OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree and the frequency of the nailfold capillary abnormalities and to correlate these with clinicolaboratory variables of Beh√ßets disease. METHODS: A stereomicroscope was applied to study the nutritional skin capillaries of the nailfolds. Stages 0, A, B and C (Fagrell's classification) were distinguished. RESULTS: In 40 healthy subjects capillary abnormalities (stage A) were detected in 7%. In 33 of our patients abnormal nailfold capillary findings (stages A, B, C) were noted in 75%. The stage of capillary abnormalities was significantly correlated with skin manifestations (p = 0.03), arthritis/arthralgia (p = 0.04), and pathergy test (p = 0.04). The correlation between stages 0 and A and eye involvement was not significant (p = 0.08). Disease duration was longer in patients of stage C than in stage 0 but this difference was also not significant (p < 0.10). CONCLUSION: Using a noninvasive method we detected nailfold capillary abnormalities in the majority of our patients.
