In a prospective open trial, the effect of pulse cyclophosphamide or methylprednisolone in the treatment of Beh√ßet's disease uveitis was studied. The therapeutic effect was evaluated based on two scores: one evolutive, reflecting ocular inflammation and calculated for each eye before and after therapy; and the other, a measure of disease severity, which took into consideration the irreversible damage. Patients who received cyclophosphamide pulse therapy (n = 8) had significantly lower evolutive scores (16.12 +/- 3.95, vs 10.37 +/- 8.53, p < 0.01) than the patients receiving classical methylprednisolone pulse therapy (n = 20), who had no significant changes in their evolutive scores (12.95 +/- 8.55, vs 10.05 +/- 8.56, p > 0.05).
