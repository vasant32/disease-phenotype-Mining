Serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) production was measured in 43 Adamantiades-Beh√ßet's disease (A-BD) patients and in 46 healthy volunteers using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mean serum IL-8 level of the patients (14.6 +/- 3 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that of controls (10.8 +/- 3 pg/ml, P < 0.05). Since IL-8 is known to have proinflammatory properties, it may play some role in the pathogenesis of A-BD. We also investigated the activity of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the 43 patients with A-BD and in the 46 healthy volunteers. Serum SOD activity was markedly increased in the patients with A-BD (13.1 +/- 3%), especially in active A-BD, compared with that in the healthy volunteers (6.7 +/- 3%, P < 0.01). Our results suggest the involvement of IL-8 and SOD in the pathogenesis of A-BD as seen in other inflammatory diseases.
