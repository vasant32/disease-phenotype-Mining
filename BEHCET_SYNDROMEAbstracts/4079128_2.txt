Frequency and clinical manifestations of Behcet's disease were investigated in the Teaching Hospital of Tianjin Medical College, China. Diagnosis of Behcet's disease was made according to the diagnostic criteria proposed by the Japanese Research Committee on Behcet's disease. Forty-two patients, 14 men and 28 women, were found to have Behcet's disease. Fourteen patients belonged to the complete type and 28 to the incomplete type. Frequency of ocular lesions, especially in women patients, was lower and that of genital ulcers higher in China than those in Japan.
