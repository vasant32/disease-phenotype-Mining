Central nervous system involvement is rarely an initial presenting manifestation of Beh√ßet's disease (BD). We report the case of a 33-year-old man with recurrent attacks of fever, oral mucosal ulcers, deep venous thrombosis, diplopia, vertigo and headache. Sequential brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed fluctuating lesions of the brain stem, mesencephalon and thalamus. F-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed hypometabolism at the parieto-occipital cortex at both sides and the brain stem. Treatment with prednisone and cyclosporine A led to a complete remission and normalisation of MRI and FDG-PET lesions. The present case illustrates the difficulty in the differential diagnosis of early neuro-BD.
