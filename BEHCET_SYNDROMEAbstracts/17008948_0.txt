Gastrointestinal manifestations of both Behçet's disease and intestinal tuberculosis include the signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, vomiting, diarrhea and palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. We report the case of a male patient with Behçet's disease who had multiple ileal perforations due to miliary tuberculosis. It was suspected that the perforations were due to intestinal manifestation of Behçet's disease, but the final pathology report and chest X-ray one week after surgery demonstrated the presence of miliary tuberculosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Behçet's disease with intestinal perforation due to miliary tuberculosis.
