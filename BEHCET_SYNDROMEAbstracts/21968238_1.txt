 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term effect of infliximab on ocular and extraocular manifestations in patients with Behçet's disease. METHODS: Seven patients with active Behçet's disease and treated with infliximab at Aichi Medical University Hospital for more than 18 months were included in the study. We evaluated visual acuity, the average number of uveitis attacks involving the posterior segment, and general disease activity every 2 months. The Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) was used for an overall index of disease activity. Anti-infliximab antibody levels were examined in the patients' sera. RESULTS: The follow-up period after initial introduction of infliximab ranged from 19 to 40 months (mean ± SD, 32 ± 8.7 months). The number of infliximab infusions ranged from 12 to 24 (19 ± 4.4). By the 2-month follow-up, the frequency of uveitis attacks involving the posterior segment and the BDCAF scores were significantly improved compared to the 2 months before introducing infliximab. Anti-infliximab antibodies were detected in the sera of all examined patients. CONCLUSIONS: Significant long-term improvement in both the frequency of uveitis attacks involving the posterior segment and overall disease activity was provided by the administration of infliximab to patients suffering from Behçet's disease, despite the presence of anti-infliximab antibodies.
