Behçet's disease is a chronic vascularitis characterized by recurrent ulcers of the mouth and genitalia and iridocyclitis. Vascular complications involving venous thrombosis and arterial lesions are rare. We report a case of Behçet's disease in 30 year-old man revealed by a voluminous right femoral aneurysm and a thrombosed aneurysm of the left iliofemoral trunk. Disease exacerbation was marked by oral ulceration and ocular lesions that delayed surgical cure for 7 days. After surgical resection of the aneurysm, a femoro-femoral bypass was constructed with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The left iliofemoral aneurysm was left intact. After 4 years of regular follow-up, there have been no surgical complications. The timing of surgery in patients with a voluminous aneurysm is debated during phases of active disease.
