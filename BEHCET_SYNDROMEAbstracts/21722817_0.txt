 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is an inflammatory vasculitis, most common in the Mediterranean area and Asia. Evidence for accelerated atherosclerosis in BD has been observed. The relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with BD is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipid profile and to investigate the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) size and the distribution of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subpopulations in BD patients. METHODS: Thirty six BD patients were compared to 36 healthy controls. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were measured using standard techniques. HDL subclasses and LDL-C size were estimated using polyacrylamide linear gradient gel electrophoresis. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was also calculated. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level was measured by a turbidimetric method. Homocysteine (Hcy) level was determined using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). RESULTS: In BD patients, HDL-C levels as well as its subfraction levels were decreased (respectively, p <10(-6) and p <10(-3)). Percentage of HDL2 subpopulation was also decreased (p=0.02). HDL3 subfraction was significantly higher (p=0.02). The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and CRP level were increased (respectively, p=10(-4) and p=0.003). TC was correlated with CRP. HDL-C and its subfractions were correlated with CRP and TG levels. HDL subparticle percentages were also correlated with age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of a reduction of HDL-C and HDL2 subpopulation and an increase HDL3 subclass and a higher LDL-C/HDL-C ratio may be considered as important predictors of cardiovascular events in BD patients.
