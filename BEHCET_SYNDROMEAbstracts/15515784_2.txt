OBJECTIVE: Gramzyme A (GrA) is a serine proteinase with trypsin-like activity that is released extracellularly during the degranulation of cytotoxic cells. Among the cytotoxic cells, gamma/delta T cells participate in the early phases of the immune response and are known to express perforin and granzymes constitutively in agreement with their cytolytic pontential. METHODS: GrA activity was detected using the synthetic substrate N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester in the plasma and supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultured in the presence of Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate to obtain Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell expansion. RESULTS: Significantly high levels of GrA were found in the serum and supernatants of lymphocytes from patients with active Beh√ßet's disease cultured in the presence of DMAPP. Levels were found to be significantly lower after remission. A positive correlation was observed between GrA levels in the supernatants and the Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell expansion factor. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells are active participants in the pathogenesis of the disease through their degranulation and granzyme release.
