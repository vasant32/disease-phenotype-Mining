The F response parameters may provide a sensitive method for detection of mild neuropathy in patients with otherwise normal nerve conduction studies. We investigated conventional nerve conduction studies and F response parameters in patients with Behçet's disease (BD), but without neurologic involvement. The results indicate that ulnar motor and sensory, tibial motor and sural sensory nerve conduction studies failed to differentiate the patients with BD and controls. In the ulnar nerve, the F response parameters were not significantly different for the populations. In the tibial nerve, the F response latency and chronodispersion were increased while F amplitude, duration, and persistence were all decreased in patients with BD. The results suggests that, (1) peripheral nerve dysfunction occurred especially in lower extremities in patients with Behçet's disease. (2) The F response parameters were considered the most sensitive method for the detection of neuropathy in Behçet's disease.
