A 59-year-old woman was diagnosed with incomplete type Beh√ßet's syndrome in 1994. The patient was hospitalized with pharyngitis and fever in August 2000, and was treated using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Symptoms improved and she was discharged. After only 3 weeks, she reported swallowing disturbance due to retrosternal pain. Esophagoscopy revealed multiple shallow oval ulcerations in the middle esophagus. Colonoscopy revealed aphthous lesions in the rectum. Prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg) was initiated for treatment of esophageal involvement. Symptoms gradually improved and subsequent esophagoscopy revealed complete healing of esophageal ulcerations.
