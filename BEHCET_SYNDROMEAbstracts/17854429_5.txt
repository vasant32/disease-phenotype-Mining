Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the induction of defense mechanisms of the innate and adaptive immune responses to microbial pathogens. Genetic polymorphisms within the TLR9 gene have been reported to be associated with a variety of inflammatory and infectious diseases. Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory disease, and the etiology of BD has yet to be fully elucidated. We investigated the potential association of the TLR9 gene with susceptibility to BD by analyzing the frequency of nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a population of 200 Japanese BD patients and 102 randomized controls. Our results showed that SNPs in the TLR9 gene were not significantly associated with susceptibility to BD.
