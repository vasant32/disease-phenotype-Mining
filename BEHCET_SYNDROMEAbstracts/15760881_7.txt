Neuro-Behcet disease is one of the clinical forms of Behcet disease. We report a case of neuro-Behcet disease mimicked a brain tumor. This case was initially considered as a brain tumor from mass lesion with edema at left basal ganglia on radiologic images. The lesion, however, was not neoplasia by pathologic diagnosis. By using steroid therapy, the size had been markedly shrunken on the follow-up images. The clinical symptoms were also improved.
