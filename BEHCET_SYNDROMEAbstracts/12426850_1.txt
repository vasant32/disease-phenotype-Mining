The case of a 36-year old man with Beh√ßet's disease (BS) for 16 years had low back pain and stiffness in the cervical and lumbar spine. He was diagnosed as having ankylosing spondylitis (AS). In this report we wish to emphasize the clinically occult co-existence of AS in BS and revelation of AS after a long time of BS diagnose.
