Genetic factors that predispose individuals to Beh√ßet's disease (BD) are considered to play important roles in the development of the disease. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BD. Our aim was to determine a possible association of specific polymorphisms of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1 receptor antagonist genes with susceptibility for BD. We genotyped 72 patients with BD and 163 healthy controls for IL-1alpha-889, IL-1beta-511, and +3953 (nt5887) single-nucleotide polymorphisms besides IL-1 receptor antagonist variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism (for five different alleles). Comparison of the IL-1beta+3953 T allele and TT genotype frequencies showed a significant difference between patients with BD and controls (54.2 vs. 40.5%, OR = 1.74, P = 0.024, and 40.3 vs. 19.6%, OR = 2.76, P = 0.009, respectively). However, no difference was observed in the genotype or allele frequencies of IL-1alpha-889, IL-1beta-511, and IL-1 receptor antagonist between the patients with BD and the controls. Our results indicate that susceptibility to BD is increased in individuals carrying the IL-1beta+3953 T allele and TT genotype.
