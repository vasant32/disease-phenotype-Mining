Behçet disease is a multisystemic vasculitis of unknown origin. The vascular complications as a result of the disease are rare in the pediatric age group. We report a 13-year-old patient with vasculo-Behçet disease with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm without a formerly known history of Behçet disease. Urgent aortoiliac bypass with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft was performed with success, and the patient has also received corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drug therapy.
