The paroxysmal attacks which are frequently encountered in the course of multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterised by their sudden onset, short duration and frequent repetition. Such attacks have also been reported in some other diseases affecting the CNS, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. However, to our knowledge, they have not been reported in neuro-Beh√ßet's disease (NBD). A patient with NBD who developed paroxysmal dysarthriaataxia attacks is presented, and the similarity of some clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiological aspects of NBD and MS are discussed with special emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging findings.
