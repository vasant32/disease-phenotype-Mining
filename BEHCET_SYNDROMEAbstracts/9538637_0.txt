Behçet's syndrome is a multi-systemic and chronic disorder that affects many organs. It has been suggested that the diagnosis was based on the presence of the 'major' and 'minor' clinical criteria. When thromobophlebitis, arthritis, central nervous system or gastrointestinal lesions are also present. Behçet's syndrome will be thought to be present in the appropriate geographic area. We report a case of superior vena cava syndrome caused by Behçet's disease in a 40-year-old man with recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and skin rashes on the anterior chest wall. There were multiple thrombosis of the superior vena cava, innominate and subclavian veins. This patient also had a solitary cecal ulcer with an ileocecal fistula and downhill varix. The chest CT, veno-cavography, pulmonary angiography and colon study were taken and follow-up was performed.
