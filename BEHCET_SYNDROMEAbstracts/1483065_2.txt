The sera of 122 patients with uveitis were examined for the presence of various antinuclear autoantibodies. Overall 21.3% of the patients had antibodies to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and 18% to Ro (SSA). When subdividing the patients according to primary uveitis versus secondary uveitis, the autoantibodies were detected more frequently in the second group [anti-RNP 13.3 vs. 31.4%, anti-Ro (SSA) 11.8 vs. 27.7%, anti-Sm 10.3 vs. 24% and poly (G) 2.9 vs. 14.8%, respectively]. No differences could be asserted in autoantibody frequencies according to disease location within the uvea. Among uveitis patients afflicted with sarcoidosis a particular high incidence of autoantibodies was detected in comparison with all other subgroups of patients with uveitis. Although the presence of autoantibodies among patients with uveitis appears not to have a major diagnostic value, their assessment may aid to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis.
