Behcet's disease (BD) is characterized by a great geographic diversity of clinico-evolutive features. We identify the main clinical characteristics in our series as compared to other data in international literature. We studied 36 patients (16 women and 20 men) with BD fulfilling International Study Group for Behcet's Disease (ISGBD) criteria. We recorded the clinical features and compared the data with other recent statistics. The incidence of clinical manifestations in our group was the following: oral ulcerations -97.4%, genital ulcerations - 55.5%, vascular disease - 50%, antiphospholipid antibodies - 55%, digestive tract lesions - 28.5%, eye disease - 27.7%, pulmonary disease - 8.3%, arthritis - 5.4%, CNS lesions - 2.7%. The clinical course was generally mild. Our patients had a higher incidence of vasculo-thrombotic events, of APLAs and of oral aphthosis, as compared to other statistics. Eye disease, CNS, articular involvement and pathergy were encountered rarer than in other groups. Two cases had atypical onsets: one with a pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesion and the other with severe pulmonary hypertension. BD has protean clinical aspects, with important geographic particularities. Our patients ran a relatively mild course of the disease, more like the Western European than the Asian patients. Vasculothrombotic disease was an important feature, with a subsequent risk for mortality.
