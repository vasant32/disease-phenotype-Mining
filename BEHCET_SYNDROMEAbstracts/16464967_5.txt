BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chemokines are key molecules that initiate leucocyte infiltration to the inflammatory site. The involvement of chemokines in uveitis is well studied, yet the source of this molecule in the inflamed eye is not clearly identified. The possible sources of chemokines are ocular resident cells or the inflammatory cells infiltrated to the eye. Here the authors examined whether ocular infiltrating T cells of uveitis patients do produce chemokines. METHODS: T cell clones (TCCs) were established from ocular infiltrating cells of patients with non-infectious uveitis. TCCs were characterised using flow cytometry. Spontaneous production of chemokines by TCCs was evaluated by ELISA. RESULTS: TCCs from ocular infiltrating cells were revealed to be memory activated Th1 type CD4 positive cells. Those TCCs produced larger amounts of chemokines than TCCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of uveitis or healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that ocular infiltrating T cells of patients with non-infectious uveitis produce chemokines and recruit further infiltrating lymphoid cells. Such T cells may have roles in the prolonged/chronic state of non-infectious uveitis.
