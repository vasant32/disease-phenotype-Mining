A case of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) with occlusion of both caval veins and "downhill" esophageal varices is reported. A 59-year-old male patient had esophageal varices, established as the "downhill" type by endoscopy, venography, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) scan. Venography via both jugular veins did not lead to the visualization of the superior vena cava (SVC), but revealed numerous collateral veins, which formed esophageal varices en route. Venography via both femoral veins did not lead to the visualization of the inferior vena cava (IVC), but revealed numerous collateral veins, which flowed into the portal vein together with the jugular flow. CE-CT scan revealed the disappearance of the SVC and the lower part of the IVC, below the hepatic vein. The patient was diagnosed as having BD, based on his history of recurrent oral and skin lesions over the past 26 years.
