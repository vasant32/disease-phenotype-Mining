An Italian Olympic athlete with a severe form of Beh√ßet's disease was given infliximab. He had oral aphthosis, papulopustular and follicular lesions, and a bilateral cystoid macular edema. After the first 3 infusions, the mucocutaneous lesions disappeared and cystoid macular edema was much improved. Cyclosporine was stopped and the prednisone dose was progressively tapered until the cystoid macular edema disappeared.
