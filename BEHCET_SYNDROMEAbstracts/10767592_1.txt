Behçet's disease is a multisystem disorder characterized by recurrent aphtous ulcers of mucosal membranes, skin lesions, and vasculitis. The prevalence of vascular involvement is about 25% and this is the leading cause of death in Behçet's disease. Jugular vein involvement is an unusual manifestation of Behçet's disease. Medical insertion of needles into veins or arteries can induce thrombosis or aneurysms. Thus, diagnostic studies or therapy can aggravate the disease and even be fatal. We report a patient with Behçet's disease and rare internal jugular vein thrombosis. We also demonstrate the ability of noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography to aid in the diagnosis and evaluation of vascular involvement in Behçet's disease, without risking iatrogenic complications.
