 BACKGROUND: There are few published clinical trials concerning upper gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in BehÃ§et's disease (BD), and most have been performed on patients with upper GI tract symptoms. AIM: We sought to determine whether routine endoscopy is indicated in asymptomatic patients with BD and whether Helicobacter pylori plays a role in the pathogenesis of BD. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with BD and 40 age- and gender-matched controls with tinea pedis were studied. All patients underwent fiberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Urea breath test was used to identify H. pylori. RESULTS: Abnormalities were noted in 37 patients (93%): hiatal hernia (53%), antral gastritis (33%), pan-gastritis (23%), gastric ulceration (8%), and duodenal ulceration (8%). Helicobacter pylori was found in 26 patients (65%) with BD and in 28 controls (70%) (no significant difference by chi-squared test, P > 0.05). We found a high incidence of upper GI abnormalities in BD, but the abnormalities were not specific for the disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Routine endoscopy and screening for H. pylori infection may not be necessary in asymptomatic patients with BD.
