Beh√ßet's disease is a systemic disease most frequently presenting in the form of oro-genital ulcers. More rarely, other genital and bladder lesions, responsible for disorders of micturition, may also be observed. In these cases, urological management is necessary to prevent repercussions on the upper urinary tract. The authors report the case of a young patient who presented with epididymitis and severe urinary frequency in the context of this disease. The various clinical signs responded to simple medical treatment.
