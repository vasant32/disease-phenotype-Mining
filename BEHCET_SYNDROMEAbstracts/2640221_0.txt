Adamantiades-Beh√ßet disease is a well known clinical entity in the Mediterranean area. Signs and complications in these patients, arising from the macular area, are often overlooked for a prolonged period of time, because they are masked by the inflammatory signs of the anterior segment and/or the vitreous. Although blindness, in most cases, is the result of the optic disc atrophy, the macular alterations--as a sequelae of inflammation--are responsible for the low visual acuity. The authors in a retrospective clinical study of the last 100 consecutive cases of A-B disease, studied these macular alterations in detail. Their findings are also described in detail. Therapeutic modalities center around treatment with steroids, Cyclosporine A, and argon laser application. The results obtained from a long follow-up period are discussed.
