 PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of azathioprine as an immunosuppressive for steroid-resistant autoimmune uveitis (AIU). METHODS: Patients using oral prednisolone for active AIU without clinical response were recruited. A standard protocol of oral prednisolone and azathioprine was used. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients participated in the study: 3 with anterior uveitis, 1 pars planitis, 4 idiopatic panuveitis, 8 Vogt-Koyonagi-Harada syndrome, 3 Behcet disease, and 8 choroidoretinopathies. Complete response was observed in 92%. Eleven patients had well-tolerated minor side effects. CONCLUSION: Azathioprine is safe and effective in controlling steroid-resistant AIU.
