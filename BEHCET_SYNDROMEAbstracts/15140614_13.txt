We investigated the prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients with Behçet's disease (BD) without overt neurological involvement. The influence of disease duration, disease activity, prednisone dosage, and anxiety and depression levels was evaluated. Twenty-six consecutive BD outpatients and 26 healthy controls matched for age, education and sex completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including tests of memory, visuospatial and constructional abilities, language, attention and psychomotor speed, non-verbal reasoning and executive functioning. The Hamilton scales for anxiety and depression were administered. Disease activity was assessed using the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF). Compared to controls, BD patients were significantly impaired on tasks evaluating long-term verbal and non-verbal memory, and visuospatial skills. In addition, BD patients were significantly more anxious and depressed than controls. Cognitive impairment was evident in 46.1% of BD patients compared with none of control subjects (p<0.0001), with memory representing the cognitive domain most affected. Both high disease activity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.5, p<0.04) and high prednisone dosage (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7, p<0.03) were independently associated with cognitive impairment in BD after adjustment for demographic variables. Cognitive impairment, involving mainly memory functions, occurs frequently in BD patients. It may occur independently of clinically overt neurological involvement, and is more common in patients with an active disease and in those receiving prednisone.
