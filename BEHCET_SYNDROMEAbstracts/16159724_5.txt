 AIM: To report a 47-year-old Japanese woman with a one-year history of Behçet's disease who complained of sudden bilateral visual loss with concurrent anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). CASE REPORT: The patient's Snellen visual acuity was 0.1 (OD) and 0.3 (OS) of onset. There was bilateral mild anterior chamber inflammation. Bilateral optic disc pale swelling was observed without retinal exudates and edema. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated bilateral hypofluorescence of the optic disc in early frames but with no distinct retinal vasculitis. Visual field showed bilateral relative central scotoma and right altitudinal hemianopsia. Laboratory examination revealed an ESR of 26 mm in the first hour with a C-reactive protein level of < 0.3 mg/dl. Periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide in both eyes without systemic corticosteroid administration improved her visual acuity to 0.7 (OD) and 1.2 (OS) within 45 days of onset. Bilateral optic disc swelling gradually resolved. In the early stages, fluorescein angiography demonstrated normal optic disc filling in both eyes. There was a residual right central scotoma on visual field. CONCLUSION: We observed an extremely rare case of simultaneous bilateral AION with Behçet's disease with marked visual recovery within 45 days of onset.
