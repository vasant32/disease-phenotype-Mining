Beh√ßet's disease is a multi systemic vasculitis of unknown origin characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcerations, uveitis and skin lesions. Vascular involvement mainly interesting the venous system is present in about 7 to 38% of patients. Arterial involvement is present in 2 to 8% of patients and is associated with a high mortality. It may present as aneurysms, pseudo aneurysms or arterial occlusions. Pseudo aneurysm formation has been reported to be sometimes due to invasive imaging techniques, it may also follow arterial repair. We report two exceptional localizations of iatrogenic pseudo aneurysms due to accidental arterial puncture, involving respectively the internal carotid artery and the humeral artery. We discuss the clinical characteristics and therapeutic modalities of this complication.
