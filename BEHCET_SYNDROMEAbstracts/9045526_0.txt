Beh√ßet's disease is a chronic disorder of unclear pathogenesis defined by multiple genital and oral ulcers, as well as ophthalmic changes. The patient described in this case report presented clinically with recurrent genital discharge, recurrent mild genital pain and a cervical ulcer. The diagnosis of Bechet's disease was established by the presence of cervical ulceration, two minor aphthous lesions in the vestibulum oris and a positive pathergy test. Although rare, Behcet's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of genital ulceration of unknown etiology.
