Behcets disease is a multisystemic inflammatory disease characterized with recurrent oral ulcer, genital ulcer, and multiple organ involvement. Aplastic anemia is one of the rarest complications of Behcets disease. There were only several reports about Behcets disease associated myelodysplatic syndrome worldwide. Moreover, aplastic anemia in intestinal Behcets disease was rarely reported. Here, we present a case of aplastic anemia with trisomy 8 and trisomy 9 in intestinal Behcets disease and a review of the literatures. To the authors knowledge, this is the first case ever reported in Korea.
