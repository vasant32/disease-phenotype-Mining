Two patients diagnosed as Beh√ßet's disease (BD) were found to be neutropenic. Chronic benign neutropenia commonly presents with symptoms that mimic BD. Here, it is important to decide whether neutropenia is a complication of BD or if the symptoms should be attributed to neutropenia. In our patients, symptoms improved after the treatment of neutropenia with granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Both patients had high antistreptolysin O titers denoting a recent streptococcal infection.
