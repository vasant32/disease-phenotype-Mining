Twenty-six patients with Beh√ßet's disease were studied for serum levels of anticardiolipin (ACL) antibody isotypes IgG and IgM. The frequency of elevated levels of ACL antibody isotype IgM was found to be significantly increased in these patients. This increased frequency, however, did not correlate statistically with a thrombotic tendency, colchicine intake, antinuclear antibodies, or a positive VDRL test.
