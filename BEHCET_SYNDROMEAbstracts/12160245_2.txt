To study the involvement of the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD), PCR was used to detect HSV-1 DNA and RNA (LAT, TK, gB) in peripheral blood leukocytes and oral smears from patients with BD. Out of 32 patients with BD and 30 healthy volunteers, HSV-1 specific DNA was not detected in any case. Using a highly sensitive competitive RT-PCR method, HSV-1 specific mRNA was not detected either in peripheral blood leukocytes from any of the patients or volunteers. In contrast, serum levels of IgG anti HSV-1 antibody were higher in patients with BD; however, there were 70% sero-positives among the control subjects. Even though it has been reported that the highly frequent presence of the HSV-1 genome in peripheral blood is a characteristic feature of BD, our results show that the HSV-1 genome and its expression are not present in peripheral blood in patients with BD. We could not find any evidence that the lesions associated with BD were caused by the direct lytic effects of HSV-1.
