A 42-year-old man with Behçet's disease of the intestinal type and a chronic cholestatic profile is presented. He had oral aphthea, genital ulcer, erythema nodosum, thrombophlebitis and central retinitis during the clinical course. Deep ileal ulcers recurred with massive bleeding and perforation. Cholestatic laboratory findings were also noted in the clinical course. A biopsied liver specimen, taken at the second operation for the ileal ulcer, showed chronic portal inflammation associated with ductopenia and epithelial degeneration of the small interlobular bile ducts, but periductal concentric fibrosis was not found. The patient died of sepsis 7 months after the last laparotomy. Although there was no significant abnormality in the large biliary tract at autopsy, pericholangitis in the small portal tracts and cholestasis were pronounced. Sclerosing cholangitis is one of well-known complications of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. We report herein another rare association of small bile duct damage resembling sclerosing cholangitis with enteritis in Behçet's disease.
