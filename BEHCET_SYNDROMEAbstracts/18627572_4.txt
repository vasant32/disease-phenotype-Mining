Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 is a well-known genetic factor associated with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). To analyse the influence of HLA-B*51 and other HLA class I alleles in BD susceptibility in a Portuguese population and its association with disease severity, we studied 78 BD patients and 208 healthy controls. The patients were classified into two severity groups as described by Gul et al. As expected, a higher frequency of HLA-B*51 was found. The frequency of HLA-Cw*16 alleles was significantly higher in patients. Regarding severity, HLA-B*27 frequency was higher in the severe group compared with controls and with the mild group. Thus, HLA-B*51 and HLA-Cw*16 seem to confer susceptibility to BD in this patients. HLA-B*27 may be important as a prognostic factor.
