We present a case of a young man hospitalized for a fever and bipolar aphtous. The absence of typical ocular lesions, the delayed occurrence of thromboflebitis, arthritis, abnormal skin reactivity, as well as the presence of splenomegaly and limphoadenopathy, induced us to consider a large variety of infection disease before the diagnosis of Beh√ßet's Syndrome. The complete remission has been achieved with corticosteroids and Laevamisole (150 mg/weekly). No therapy has been necessary in the last twelve months.
