In order to investigate the sub-typing of the B5 antigen in Israeli (Jewish and Arabic) patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) allele-specific genotyping of B51 and B52 alleles was performed in Israeli BD patients and healthy controls. Among the HLA-B51-positive BD patients, B*5101 was found to be the predominant allele, identified in 62% of all BD patients and 78% of Jewish BD patients. HLA-B*5101 was also the predominant allele in HLA-B51-positive healthy controls. HLA-B*5108 and B*5104 alleles were identified in 23% and 15% of B51-positive BD patients, respectively. The HLA-B*5201 allele was identified in all HLA-B52-positive patients and controls. Our study suggests that both HLA-B*5101 and HLA-B*5201 are the dominant alleles of HLA-B5 in Israeli BD patients.
