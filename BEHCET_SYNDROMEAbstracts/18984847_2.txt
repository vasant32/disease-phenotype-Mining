Behçet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory vasculitic disorder with a chronic course for which the etiology is unknown. The central nervous system can be affected in 5% to 30% of all Behçet patients, yet it has been rarely reported in children or in Western countries. We describe a 14-year-old girl with Behçet's disease that presented initially as a cerebral infarct without venous sinus thrombosis.
