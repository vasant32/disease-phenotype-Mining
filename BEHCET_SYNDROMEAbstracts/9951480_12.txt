OBJECTIVE: To examine choroidopathy in patients with Behçet disease. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three patients (63 eyes) with Behçet disease. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent simultaneous indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescein angiography with a double detector of scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Angiographic findings recorded on videotapes were evaluated. The relation of angiographic findings with systemic activity and aqueous inflammation was also analyzed. RESULTS: Fluorescein angiography showed leakage in varying degrees from retinal vessels in 30 patients (53 eyes, 84%). The ICG angiographic findings were choroidal vascular wall staining in 16 eyes (25%), hyperfluorescent spots in 42 eyes (66%) and hypofluorescent plaques in 22 eyes (35%), both of which were not evident with fluorescein, leakage from choroidal vessels in 3 eyes (5%), and irregular filling of choriocapillaris in 11 eyes (17%). These findings did not have a statistically significant correlation with the presence or absence of aqueous inflammation or oral aphthous ulcerations. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with Behçet disease showed choroidal abnormalities, which could be revealed only by ICG angiography, but not with funduscopy or fluorescein angiography. Simultaneous ICG and fluorescein angiography would be useful for examining choroidal lesions in Behçet disease.
