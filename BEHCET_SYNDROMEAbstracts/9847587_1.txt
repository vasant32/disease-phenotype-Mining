Multiple aortic aneurysms in Beh√ßet's disease were repaired with transluminaly placed endovascular stent grafts. Before deploying the stent graft device for permanent implantation for the saccular aneurysm located in the descending thoracic aorta, from which feeding arteries for the spinal cord possibly branched, a retrievable stent graft was inserted and evoked spinal cord potential (ESP) were monitored in order to predict spinal cord ischemia. The original retrievable stent graft, constructed of a self-expandable Z-shaped stainless steel stent covered with e-PTFE, can be easily withdrawn into a 18 Fr. sheath after deployment. Blood flow into intercostal arteries branching from that part of the descending aorta where the permanent stent graft is planned to be implanted, is intercepted by the retrievable stent graft. A change of ESP during the temporary implantation of the device indicates that spinal cord ischemia would be caused by permanent implantation of the stent graft. In this case, no change of ESP was observed and the patient showed no postoperative paraplegia. The retrievable stent graft was useful for prediction of spinal cord ischemia before endoluminal stent graft repair of the descending aortic aneurysm. However, the device is not flexible enough to fit a severely tortuous aorta, therefore we are obliged to select patients to some extent. Further improvement of the device is required to make prediction of spinal cord ischemia with the retrievable stent graft possible in all cases.
