BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease can be aggravated by chronic infection. Our case illustrates how the disease can be disclosed during an acute activation of a chronic infectious focus. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old man had Behçet's syndrome associating fever, bipolar aphtosis, cutaneous pseudo folliculitis, anterior uveitis, and meningitis following an acute episode of a dental infection, with periapical granuloma. Antibiotic therapy was ineffective in calming this first flare-up of Behçet's disease. Corticosteroid and colchicine therapy were effective. DISCUSSION: Clinical and experimental work would implicat buccal streptococcal flora in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease. Antibiotics offer interesting perspectives but further studies are needed to define their role in the treatment of Behçet's disease.
