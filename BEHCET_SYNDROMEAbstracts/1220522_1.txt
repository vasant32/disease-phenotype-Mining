The authors describe a patient, suffering from recurring uveitis, buccal aphthous ulcers and meningo-myelitis. The diagnosis of Behcet's disease accounts for the whole clinical picture and has been confirmed by a cutaneous hypersensitivity to scratching. The authors stress the similarity between the neurological aspects of Behcet's disease and multiple sclerosis not only on the clinical side but also concerning the CSF composition (lympho-mono-plasmatocytic meningogram, increase and fractionation of gammaglobulins). The authors present a critical review of the evidence in favour of a viral aetiology. They put forward the clinical and experimental data in favour of an auto-immune aetiopathogeny. Treatment with corticosteroids associated with immunosuppressive drugs proved beneficial.
