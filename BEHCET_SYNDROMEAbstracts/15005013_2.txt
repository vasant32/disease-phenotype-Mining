Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multi-system inflammatory disorder which may involve the vascular system. Currently, it is general practice to use the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for the diagnosis of BD. However, even though vascular involvement may be seen in one-fourth to one-half of BD patients, and occasionally is the presenting and only manifestation of BD, large vessel disease is not included among the ISG criteria. In this report we describe a patient who had deep venous thrombosis and priapism, but who does not fulfill ISG criteria for the diagnosis of BD.
