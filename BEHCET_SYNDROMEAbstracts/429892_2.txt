A forty-two-year-old man known to have Behçet's disease (two major and two minor symptoms) (Mason and Baines, 1969) presented with dysphagia, hoarseness and regurgitation of food. This was subsequently found to be due to a tracheo-oesphageal fistula consequent upon an area of Behçet's ulceration in the oesophagus. The fistula was excised, the defects in the trachea and oesophagues repaired, and the patient's recovery was uneventful.
