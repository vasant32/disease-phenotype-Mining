Acyclovir is a potent antiviral drug, of proven efficacy in the treatment of herpes simplex virus infection. Since this virus has been implicated in the aetiology of Beh√ßet's syndrome, the effect of acyclovir on orogenital ulceration in this condition was determined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Eighteen of 22 patients entering the study completed the trial. Treatment with acyclovir failed to alleviate the frequency and severity of orogenital ulceration or other disease features.
