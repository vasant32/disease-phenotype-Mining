A 42-year-old man with Beh√ßet's disease developed a rapidly growing mass under his right lower eyelid a week after transconjunctival cryotherapy. He underwent surgical drainage of the mass following imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated the abscess, which did not violate the orbital septum. Cultures from drained material yielded Staphylococcus aureus. He recovered completely with systemic antibiotics. Preseptal abscess may occur as a complication of intense transconjunctival cryotherapy for intraocular disorders, and patients should be followed closely within the first few weeks postoperatively.
