OBJECTIVE: To investigate blood flow velocity changes, pulsatility and resistivity index values of orbital vessels in Behçet's disease with or without ocular involvement (groups I and II) and healthy volunteers (group III). METHODS: Twenty-five eyes in the first group, 24 eyes in the second group and 24 eyes in the third group were examined by using color Doppler imaging. Peak systolic and end-diastolic blood flow velocity measurements, pulsatility and resistivity index values were measured in ophthalmic, central retinal, nasal and temporal ciliary arteries and the central retinal vein. RESULTS: The end-diastolic blood flow velocity measurements in all arteries were significantly higher in groups II and III than in group I, but resistivity and pulsatility indexes of all arteries were higher in group I than the other two groups. There was no significant difference in blood flow velocity of the central retinal vein in the three groups. CONCLUSION: Detection of increased vascular resistance of orbital vessels may predict the diagnosis of ocular involvement in Behçet's disease.
