We present a case of nasal endometriosis, an uncommon extrapelvic implantation of endometriotic tissue. A woman with a history of pelvic endometriosis and Behcet's syndrome was diagnosed with nasal endometriosis after episodes of perimenstrual epistaxis and nasal pain. Despite being rare, the presence of catamenial symptoms and the possibility of performing endoscopic biopsy allowed us to make the diagnosis of nasal endometriosis. The simultaneous presence of Behcet's syndrome focused our attention on the pathogenesis and the therapeutic management of endometriosis.
