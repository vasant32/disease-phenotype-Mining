Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, and rarely complicated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In the present study, we investigated the morphological myelodysplasia and apoptotic rate of bone marrow cells in 15 patients with BD in comparison with MDS patients. Morphological myelodysplasia of bone marrow cells was detected in 53.3% of BD, but none showed chromosomal abnormalities. The apoptotic rate in BD patients (26.1 +/- 8.4%) was significantly higher in normal controls (11.3 +/- 2.4%; p < 0.005) and significantly lower in patients with MDS (50.8 +/- 14.0%; p < 0.0001). These findings suggest that myelodysplasia in patients with BD is more frequent than expected, and possibly due to excess induction of apoptosis of bone marrow cells in BD. However, the rate of apoptotic bone marrow cells is lower than MDS, which may explain the slight peripheral cytopenia in BD, distinct from that in MDS.
