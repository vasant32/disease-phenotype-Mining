Behçet disease is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease affecting many different organs. Ocular involvement is quite common in the course of Behçet disease and is frequently manifested by bilateral panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Medications such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are used to reduce inflammation in patients with posterior or panuveitis. Chronic immunosuppression is a risk factor for systemic infections. We report a case of choroidal tuberculoma associated with tuberculosis in a patient with ocular Behçet disease. A 25-year-old female with known ocular Behçet disease contracted tuberculosis 3 months earlier. She had been receiving methotrexate and oral steroids. Funduscopy of the left eye revealed a choroidal tuberculoma located superonasally to the optic disc. Fluorescein angiography showed a central area of hypofluorescence surrounded by a hyperfluorescent zone. Since she was already receiving antituberculosis treatment combined with oral steroids, the same treatment was continued. Diagnosis of the other diseases that may cause uveitis in patients with Behçet disease should not be missed. This is especially important since immunosuppressive drugs, that cause an increased incidence of systemic infections, are the common treatment of choice for patients with Behçet disease.
