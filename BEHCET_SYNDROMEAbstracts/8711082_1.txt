BACKGROUND: A single case of Beh√ßet's disease was studied throughout several consultations during a period of 15 years. METHODS: The evolution of the disease was related to important events in the subject's life, cognitive patterns, psychopathological features and, particularly, his relationships to women and to his family. RESULTS: Some interesting complex correlations between illness course and psychosocial events and states were highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: Future prospective studies could better elucidate this multiple feedback.
