Although the gastrointestinal and systemic features of Behcet's syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease overlap to a considerable extent, they are generally viewed as two distinct diseases. We evaluated three members of a family who have inflammatory bowel lesions, two of whom met criteria for Behcet's syndrome. The propositus had classic features of both Crohn's ileocolitis and Behcet's syndrome. A daughter, who never met criteria for Behcet's syndrome, had undergone colectomy for ulcerative colitis. A second daughter had classic features of Behcet's syndrome, including recurrent episodes of colitis with distinct aphthous ulcers in the colon. The findings in this family suggest that inflammatory bowel disease and Behcet's syndrome may be closely related and part of a spectrum of disease rather than distinct disease entities.
