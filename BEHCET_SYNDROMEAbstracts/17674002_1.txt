Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic relapsing systemic vasculitic disorder affecting the arteries, veins, and vessels of any size. Large vein thrombosis in BD is not commonly developed and most commonly observed in the veins in the lower extremities and inferior or superior vena cava. In this report, a 18-year-old male patient with large vein thrombosis involving superior vena cava was presented. He was treated due to chylothorax and chylopericardium with SVC syndrome before diagnosis of BD. SVC thrombosis complicated by chylothorax and chyolpericardium can be a rare presenting initial symptom of BD.
