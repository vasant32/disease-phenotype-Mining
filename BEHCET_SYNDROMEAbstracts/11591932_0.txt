The authors report the case of a 35 year old patient that presented acutely with a false aneurysm of the tibioperoneal trunk diagnosed at Doppler US and CT angiography. Beh√ßet's disease was considered because of a prior history of recurrent phlebitis, the presence of bipolar aphthae and a biological inflammatory syndrome. This case is of interest for two reasons: first, the atypical location of the false aneurysm, and second, the value of less invasive imaging techniques, namely Doppler US and CT angiography.
