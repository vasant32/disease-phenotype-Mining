The poor prognosis of vasculo Behcet's disease is often due to postoperative vascular complications (false aneurysm and graft occlusion). We report a case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with an aneurysm of the left common femoral artery in a 23-year-old Portuguese man. The primary treatment was surgical (aneurysmectomy and prosthetic revascularization). The early occlusion of the left femoral revascularized artery was treated surgically with a new bypass. The occlusion of the right limb of the aortoiliac graft was asymptomatic and was not treated. Two months after admission to our hospital, the stenosis of the infrarenal aorta successfully treated by angioplasty via the occluded right limb of the graft. The patient was followed up for 18 months. He could only walk a short distance and had rest pain in the left foot. Magnetic resonance angiography showed a false aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta, and an occlusion of the remaining left limb of the aortoiliac graft. The endovascular treatment performed does not avoid the need for surgical treatment, because occlusion and false aneurysm may occur after dilatation. The endovascular approach can also be used during a sudden inflammatory surge, and makes it possible to wait for a quiescent period when surgery can be performed.
