Raised serum alkaline phosphatase (Al-P) levels were found in 23 of 213 patients (10.8%) with Behcet's disease (BD). Al-P isoenzyme studies showed an increased liver fraction. Increased Al-P levels were well correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP). It is concluded that Al-P is a good indicator for the activity of BD.
