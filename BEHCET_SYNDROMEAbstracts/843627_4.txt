In 10 patients with Behcet's syndrome, various parameters of platelet function, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied. With varying frequency the following abnormalities were found: increased retention of platelets in glass bead column, reduced platelet aggregation to low concentrations of adenosine diphosphate, elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen concentration and factor VIII activity, increased plasma antiheparin activity and impairment of fibrinolytic activity. The above abnormalities were found long after the last thrombotic episode and were more frequent in patients with a history of thrombophlebitis. It is suggested that certain hemostatic abnormalities accompany or form part of Behcet's syndrome and that they are related to the thrombotic complications characteristic of this syndrome.
