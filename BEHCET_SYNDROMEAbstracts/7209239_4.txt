Two patients with Behcet's disease and angiographically demonstrated cerebral venous thrombosis are described. Dural sinuses were involved in one patient and an internal cerebral vein in the other. Cerebral venous thrombosis was the first manifestation of the disease and occurred in the absence of other signs of "Neuro-Beh√ßet". The outcome was favorable. The unusualness of such localisations, their unknown mechanism, and difficulties in their diagnostic and treatment are emphasized.
