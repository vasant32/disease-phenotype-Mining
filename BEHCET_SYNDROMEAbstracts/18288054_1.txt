Intracardiac thrombus is a rare manifestation of Behcet's disease. OBSERVATION: we report the case of a 60 year old male patient with Beh√ßet's disease who presented with dyspnea and haemoptysis. CT angiography and echocardiography was performed allowing the identification of right heart thrombus associated with pulmonary artery aneurysm. The outcome was favourable with medical management. CONCLUSION: Intracardiac thrombus is a rare complication of Behcet's disease, but the diagnosis should be sought early in order to allow medical management to be considered.
