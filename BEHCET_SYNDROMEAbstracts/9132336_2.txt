Only few cases of cardiac conduction disturbances and arrhythmias have been reported in Behçet's disease. We recently observed the case of a 16-year-old woman with Behçet's disease in whom cardiac arrhythmia became the main clinical symptom. This observation and a review of the literature led us to the conclusion that arrhythmia could represent the clinical manifestation of an underlying myocarditis due to Behçet's disease and can be regarded as a feature of cardiac involvement of the disease.
