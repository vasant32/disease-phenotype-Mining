Behçet disease is a systemic vasculitis that can cause vascular complications. We describe a 42-year-old woman with an aortic aneurysm and common right iliac aneurysm, both saccular and complicating Behçet disease. The patient was successfully treated by an endovascular method, which currently seems to be the best therapeutic choice given the frequent anastomotic complications of conventional surgical treatment.
