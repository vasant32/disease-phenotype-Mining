Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitic disease characterized mainly by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers, uveitis and skin findings. Central nervous system involvement is a serious manifestation. A case of acute meningeal syndrome secondary to Behçet's disease is presented. Behçet's disease should always be considered in differential diagnosis of acute meningeal syndrome without signs of viral infection, particularly in the context of multisystem manifestations.
