Behçet's disease is an inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers, ocular inflammation, and skin lesions of erythema nodosum and acneiform eruptions. Selenium (Se) affects all components of the immune system, i.e., the development and expression of nonspecific, humoral, and cell-mediated responses. In general, a deficiency in Se appears to result in immunosuppression, whereas supplementation with low doses of Se appears to result in augmentation and/or restoration of immunologic functions. In this study, the distribution of Se and IgG, IgM in serum were compared in samples from healthy adult control and Behçet's disease patients. The serum Se levels were measured by AA-30-40 Varian Spectra, and immunoglobulins were measured by immunodiffusion technique. The mean (SD) serum Se level of 54.24 +/- 8.06 ng/mL among Behçet's disease subjects was significantly different (P less than 0.01) from that in the control subjects (90.01 +/- 9.94 ng/mL). We also measured IgG and IgM as 10.01 +/- 2.74 mg/mL and 1.26 +/- 0.29 mg/mL, respectively for patients, and 15.08 +/- 4.73 mg/mL and 1.58 +/- 0.43 mg/mL for controls. The mean values of IgG and IgM for patients were significantly (P less than 0.05) different from the values of controls. It seems, therefore, that a deficiency in selenium impedes the humoral immune response.
