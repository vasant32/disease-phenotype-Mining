Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystem relapsing inflammatory disorder. Nervous system involvement is the most serious manifestation of BD. Neuro-Behcet's disease (n-BD) is classified into parenchymal meningoencephalitis pattern and non-parenchymal vascular patterns. Isolated meningitis is rarely the sole presenting feature of n-BD. We report a 19-year-old man with BD who presented with cranial polyneuropathy secondary to aseptic meningitis. He made a gradual though incomplete recovery with steroid therapy. Cranial polyneuropathy secondary to meningeal involvement can be a presentation of n-BD, and Behcet's disease should be a consideration in patients with idiopathic cranial polyneuropathy.
