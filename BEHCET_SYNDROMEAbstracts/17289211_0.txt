In this paper, the multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) with the error correcting output codes (ECOC) were presented for detecting variabilities of the multiclass Doppler ultrasound signals. The ophthalmic arterial (OA) Doppler signals were recorded from healthy subjects, subjects suffering from OA stenosis, subjects suffering from ocular Behcet disease. The internal carotid arterial (ICA) Doppler signals were recorded from healthy subjects, subjects suffering from ICA stenosis, subjects suffering from ICA occlusion. Methods of combining multiple classifiers with diverse features are viewed as a general problem in various application areas of pattern recognition. Because of the importance of making the right decision, better classification procedures for Doppler ultrasound signals are searched. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the SVMs trained on the extracted features. The research demonstrated that the multiclass SVMs trained on extracted features achieved high accuracy rates.
