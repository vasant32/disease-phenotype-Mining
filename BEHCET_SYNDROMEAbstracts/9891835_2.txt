Cardiac involvement is rare in Behçet's disease. The authors report the case of a young patient with Behçet's disease and multiple cardiac complications. The remarkable feature of this case was the presence of a coronary artery (first diagonal) aneurysm associated with multiple venous thromboses. Anticoagulant therapy was changed for a platelet aggregant. Surgery was not indicated because of the fragility of the vessels.
