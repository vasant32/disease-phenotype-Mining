During a period of more than 30 years, 34 patients suffering from the Adamantiades-Beh√ßet disease have been examined and followed between at least one year till 16 years. Different treatments have been administered and particularly the immunodepressors with good results, but about all patients became drug-dependents. Long-term observations concerning the ocular and general evolution of the disease are presented and discussed. Some patients have been operated for a cataract without any inconvenience.
