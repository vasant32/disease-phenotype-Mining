Intestinal ulcers in Behçet disease tend to cause perforation, and postoperative recurrence is common with a high mortality rate. The optimal therapeutic strategy has yet to be elucidated, particularly in cases of diffuse intestinal involvement. We herein present a case of diffuse intestinal Behçet disease with ileal perforation. A 57-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our institution with complaints of intractable oral ulcers and abdominal pain. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy for perforated peritonitis in spite of the intravenous administration of prednisolone (1.5 mg/kg) under total parenteral nutrition. Macroscopically, an inflamed ileum measuring 1.6 m in length was resected, including a 1-cm perforated ulceration. Innumerable small and deep ulcers were also observed, consisting of nonspecific inflammation. The patient has been free from any recurrence of intestinal ulcers while being treated with prednisolone, colchicine, and a low-residue diet for 1.5 years.
