Behçet's disease (BD), a systemic vasculitis of unknown cause, affects many organs and systems. Neurological involvement is seen in 5-15% of the patients, and the two major forms of neurological disease seen in BD are central nervous system (CNS) parenchymal involvement and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. We report a 14-year-old boy with BD who had neuro-parenchymal involvement. The diagnosis of the systemic disease was not made until the onset of the neurological manifestations, which led to an MRI study that revealed findings suggestive of CNS involvement of BD. We therefore emphasize the importance of the localization and appearance of other characteristics of the lesions on MRI in the differential diagnosis of parenchymal neuro-Behçet syndrome.
