OBJECTIVE: To study the presentation of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) in the Saudi population and to determine any differences in clinical manifestation and prognosis between men and women. METHODS: One hundred nineteen patients with BD attending the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH & RC) and the King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) between 1979 and 1992 were studied. RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 3.4:1. The mean age was 29.3; oral ulcer was present in all the patients (100%), genital ulcer 87%, ocular involvement 65%, skin manifestations 57%, and arthritis 37%. Central nervous system involvement was present in 52 patients (44%) of which 12 had benign intracranial hypertension (BICH), pleuropulmonary manifestation 16%, deep venous thrombosis 25%, arterial thrombosis and aneurysm 18%, gastrointestinal manifestations 4%, and epididymitis 4%. Significant proteinuria was present in 9 patients 7.5%, of whom 3 had renal biopsy. The pathergy test was positive in 15 of 85 (17.5%) patients. HLA-typing was performed for 85 patients and HLA B5(51) was positive in 61 (72%) patients compared with 26% general population. CONCLUSION: Using the Fisher exact test, there was no significant difference in clinical manifestation or prognosis comparing men to women.
