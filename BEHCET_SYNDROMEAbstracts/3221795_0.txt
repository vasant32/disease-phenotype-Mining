Plasma levels of FPA and FPB beta 15-42 in patients with Beh√ßet's disease were examined. In the patients, the mean levels of FPA and FPB beta 15-42 were significantly higher than controls (p less than 0.001). Fibrinolysis subsequent to coagulation may be activated in the patients. The levels of both FPA and FPB beta 15-42 were higher during attack than in remission. The caution should be taken these levels to understand the disease activity.
