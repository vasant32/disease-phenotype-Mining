There are several diseases which present with both ocular and thoracic disease (Table I). Beh√ßet's disease (BD) may be confused with sarcoidosis because they are both multisystem inflammatory disorders presenting with uveitis, polyarthritis, meningitis, cardiovascular disease, erythema nodosum and other cutaneous lesions, and abnormal chest radiographs. The aetiology of both disorders continues to elude us. Hopefully, a careful study of the one may shed light and knowledge on the other.
