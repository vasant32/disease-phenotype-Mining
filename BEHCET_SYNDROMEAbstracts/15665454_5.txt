Anti-oxidative enzymes protect living bodies from various oxidative stresses. In the systemic autoimmune diseases, autoantibodies to oxidized molecules and to anti-oxidative enzymes have been reported. To promote understanding of the relationships between autoimmunity and oxidative stress, we here investigate whether autoimmunity to the anti-oxidative peroxiredoxin (Prxs) enzymes exists in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Specifically, we detected autoantibodies to recombinant Prx I and Prx IV respectively by ELISA and western blotting. Next, clinical parameters were compared between the anti-Prx I or IV-positive and-negative patients. We found that 33% of the 92 patients with autoimmune diseases tested possessed autoantibodies to Prx I (57% in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 19% in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 5% in Beh√ßet disease, and 46% in primary vasculitis syndrome). In contrast, autoantibodies to Prx IV were detected in only 17% of the same patients. No significant correlation was found between occurrence of the two autoantibodies. Clinically, possession of anti-Prx I autoantibodies correlated with lower serum levels of CH50, C3, and C4. Taken together, our data demonstrate the existence of autoantibodies to Prxs for the first time. The autoantibodies to Prx I may be involved in the pathophysiology of systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE and vasculitis.
