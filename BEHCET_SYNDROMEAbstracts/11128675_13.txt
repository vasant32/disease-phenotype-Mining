OBJECTIVE: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by aphthous ulcerations and uveitis, that is common in the Turkish population. Venous involvement is observed in 25% of the cases. While superficial thrombophlebitis is the most common finding, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) follows it. Hyperactivity in the coagulation pathway, hypoactive anticoagulation mechanisms, or faulty fibrinolysis generate a tendency for thrombogenesis. Mutations of the genes involved in these pathways may cause predisposition to thrombosis. METHODS: Possible roles of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T, factor V (FV) gene G1691A (Leiden), and prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms in venous thrombogenesis were evaluated in patients with BD; 100 healthy people, 30 BD patients without DVT, 30 BD patients with DVT, and 30 patients with idiopathic DVT were studied with the restriction fragment length polymorphism method for these 3 polymorphisms. The frequencies of these mutations for each group, separately and in combinations, are described. RESULTS: Among the 3 mutations, FV Leiden mutation was found to be a risk factor for DVT. An association between FV Leiden mutation and BD was likely, but FV Leiden mutation did not increase the risk for deep venous thrombogenesis in BD patients. MTHFR gene C677T mutation does not increase risk of DVT in BD either alone or combined with FV Leiden mutation. CONCLUSION: Although a thrombotic tendency is one of the major characteristics of BD, we found no association between these 3 thrombogenetic mutations and BD patients with thromboses.
