A patient with Behçet's disease, accompanied by a large aneurysm of superior mesenteric artery, developed an ischemic enteritis with multiple perforated ulcers. The ischemic necrosis of the intestine preceded by recurrent abdominal pain was due to an aneurysmal occlusion of superior mesenteric artery, but not entero-Behçet's disease. This is the first case report of intestinal infarction that occurred in a patient with vasculo-Behçet's disease involving the superior mesenteric artery. Vasculo-Behçet's disease should be included in a differential diagnosis of acute mesenteric artery thrombosis.
