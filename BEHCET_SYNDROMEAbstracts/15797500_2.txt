We report a case of Behçet's disease that presented as protracted fever of unknown origin. The diagnosis was established when a thromboembolic event and ora3l aphthous ulcers occurred simultaneously. Antibiotics had no effect on the fever, which resolved when glucocorticoid and anticoagulant therapy was given. Among causes of protracted fever of unknown origin, Behçet's disease is exceedingly rare but should be considered together with the other vasculitides. Above all, the presence of a fever should prompt a search for a thromboembolic complication.
