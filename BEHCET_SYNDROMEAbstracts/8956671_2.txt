A sixteen-year-old boy presented with varied symptoms to the hospital. After he had been diagnosed as having Beh√ßet's disease, investigations revealed two carotid aneurysms in the right common carotid artery and one abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aneurysms were resected, medical therapy was started, and the patient recovered well. Although multiple aneurysms have been reported previously, the authors believe this is the first reported case involving both the carotid and the aorta.
