Behçet's disease, as initially described, is a triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcers and relapsing uveitis. The incomplete form, in which there is no ocular involvement, has been described in Japan and Korea, but this is not commonly recognized in the southern Chinese. We reported herein a rare case of repeated intestinal perforations caused by an incomplete form of Behçet's syndrome in a southern Chinese man.
