A variety of neurological complications may occur in the various connective tissue and "collagen-vascular" diseases. Most of these complications are due to vasculitis affecting various sites in the central or peripheral nervous system. While the evidence for definitive vasculitis in SLE is not strong, small vessel damage usually is present in anatomic sites which correlate well with clinical features. Although patients with rheumatoid arthritis also may have vasculitis, neurological complications are usually related to nerve compression by rheumatoid nodules or the arthritic process itself. Considerable controversy exists regarding the accuracy of various diagnostic tests. While corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for these conditions, there are no definitive studies proving their efficacy.
