Only few cases of Behçet's and hematological malignancies have been reported until now. We recently observed a 39-year-old female patient with Behçet's disease developing a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) FAB subtype refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation [RAEB-t] with a monosomy 7 after being treated with cyclosporin A and chlorambucil for several years. This case is reported and the occurrence of hematological malignancies and Behçet's disease is reviewed.
