We report a 24-year-old man with a known Behcet's disease who was lost to follow-up for a year. The patient was admitted for the association of scrotal ulceration and inguinal folliculitis, suggesting a Behcet's disease flare-up. Necrotizing course of the folliculitis led to the diagnosis of skin infection caused by a community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, carrying Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. Bacteriological analysis should be mandatory in the absence of specific criteria for the diagnosis of Behcet's disease.
