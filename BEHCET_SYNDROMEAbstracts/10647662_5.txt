PURPOSE: We study the clinical features of epididymo-orchitis in patients with Behçet's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 57 men with Behçet's disease 7 had epididymo-orchitis during the course of disease. A questionnaire was applied to all cases and the clinical features were recorded. HLA class 1 was determined and a pathergy test was performed. RESULTS: All 7 patients fulfilled the international study group criteria for Behçet's disease. All patients had recurrent oral ulcers, skin lesions (folliculitis, erythema nodosum-like lesions) and uveitis, and 6 had recurrent genital ulcers, 2 arthritis, 1 vasculitis and 4 central nervous system involvement. The pathergy test was positive in 4 patients and all had B5(51). The allele B5101 was present in 6 patients and 1 had B5102. Recurrences were observed in 5 patients. Concurrent symptoms with epididymo-orchitis consisted of oral ulcers, fever, uveitis, arthritis and penile ulcer. Colchicine, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclosporine were administered. CONCLUSIONS: Epididymo-orchitis in patients with Behçet's disease is not as infrequent as believed. It was not the first manifestation of the disease but developed during followup. In any patient with epididymo-orchitis Behçet's disease should be considered, particularly in regions with a high prevalence of the disease.
