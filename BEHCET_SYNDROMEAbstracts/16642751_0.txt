OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of homocysteine metabolism due to Helicobacter pylori infection on the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Teaching hospital. SUBJECT: Fifty-five patients with BD divided into groups, with DVT and without DVT, 19 healthy individuals and 18 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were enrolled into the study. INTERVENTIONS: Plasma homocysteine and Hp seropositivity were determined. RESULTS: There was significant Hp positivity in all groups (p > 0.05). Homocysteine levels were not significantly different for each group except patients with CAD (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no difference for frequency of Hp infection in all groups. We conclude that Hp does not influence DVT seen in BD via homocysteine metabolism, but the methinnin-loading test would be appropriate for enlighting patients whose fasting plasma homocysteine levels are found to be normal.
