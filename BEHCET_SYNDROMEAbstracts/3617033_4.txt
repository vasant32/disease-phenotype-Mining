HLA class I, II, and III antigens were studied in Japanese patients with Behçet's disease with refractory ocular attacks. In addition to the increased frequency of B51, DQw3, especially TA10-negative DQw3, was increased and DQw1 was decreased significantly in this subgroup of Behçet's disease. As for complement markers, C4A Q0 was increased. A rare variant of BF S07 was first observed in Japanese. Although the mechanism for the DQw3 association is obscure, a possible hypothesis is that an immune-response or immune-suppression gene linked to the DQ antigens modulates the disease severity and the efficacy of treatments.
