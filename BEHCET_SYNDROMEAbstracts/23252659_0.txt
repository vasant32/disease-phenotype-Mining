Abstract Over the past decade, the off-label use of biologic agents such as TNF-α antagonists, including infliximab and adalimumab, has improved the treatment armamentarium for refractory immune-mediated uveitis, with particular success in Behçet disease-associated uveitis. Golimumab is a novel fully human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody that has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, with very promising results. Herein, the authors present the use of GLM in a case of Behçet uveitis refractory to other TNF-α blockers. There are only two reports in the literature about the use of GLM in uveitis, describing four patients with JIA-associated uveitis and a case of idiopathic retinal vasculitis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report about the use of GLM in Behçet uveitis.
