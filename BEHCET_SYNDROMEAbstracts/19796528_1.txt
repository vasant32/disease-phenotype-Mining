OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential associations between A-13G and G79A polymorphisms of the protein Z gene and venous thrombosis and other clinical manifestations in Italian patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: 176 Italian patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD and 134 healthy age- and sex- matched blood donors were genotyped for A-13G and G79A polymorphisms of the protein Z gene by molecular methods. 113 and 112 of the 176 BD patients were also genotyped for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms. Serological HLA class B51 typing was performed by a standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of clinical manifestations.RESULTS: The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of A-13G and G79A polymorphisms did not differ significantly between BD patients and healthy controls.The frequencies of carriage rates of protein Z G79A and A-13G polymorphisms in BD patients with and without DVT were similar. Similarly, no associations between thrombotic events and the protein Z gene polymorphisms studied were observed in BD patients carrying factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene G20210A mutations. No significant associations were observed between protein Z polymorphisms and the occurrence of specific clinical findings.CONCLUSION: No association between DVT and A-13G or G79A polymorphisms of the protein Z gene was found in Italian BD patients. Furthermore, these protein Z polymorphisms in BD do not seem to increase the risk of DVT due to factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene G20210A mutations.
