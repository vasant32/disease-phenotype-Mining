Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitic disorder of unknown aetiology characterised by recurrent oral and often genital ulcers, which may be associated with ocular, cutaneous, articular, neurological or vascular involvement. We report a 52-year-old woman diagnosed of neuro-BD who was treated with infliximab with a dramatic response to this treatment.
