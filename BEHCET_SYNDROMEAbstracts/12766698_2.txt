Behcet's disease is a chronic relapsing-remitting, multi-system inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. The most common central nervous system findings are demyelization and perivascular cell infiltration; meningoencephalitis, cerebral atrophy, and vascular thrombosis may also occur. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may include: paroxysmal dystonia, parkinsonism, delirium, hallucinations, and behavioral disturbances. We report an unusual case of explosive onset of motor and vocal tics with obsessive-compulsive symptoms in a 22-year-old male with Behcet's disease. The putative roles of infection and autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are explored.
