Behçet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder that presents with a classic triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcerations and uveitis with hypopyon. The initial symptom of Behçet's disease is neurological in only 3% of cases. Although Neuro-Behçet's Syndrome commonly presents with focal neurological symptoms, it is possible that psychiatric symptoms could be the first manifestation of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of Neuro-Behçet's Syndrome that presents with an acute psychotic attack.
