Behçet's disease uncommon in the pediatric population. Intracardiac thrombus and bilateral pulmonary artery aneurysms are uncommon manifestations. We are reporting one case. A 14 years old patient was admitted, with high fever, dyspnea and hemoptysis since 4 months ago. Two years ago, fever, oral ulcers, aphthae (gingival, palate, tonsils), nose ulceration in and arthralgias-arthritis were noted. Chest radiograph showed round mass in the right lower lung field. The chest tomographic computed scan and pulmonary centellography were done to investigate malformations arterial. An Intracardiac thrombus of 27 x 12 mm was identified in the right ventricle by transthoracic echocardiography. Catheterization and pulmonary angiography showed an aneurism located in the right and left lobares arteries. Medical management with immunosuppressive and anticoagulation therapy resulted in complete remission of the clinical manifestations. Due to heamodynamic compromise surgical removal of the intracardiac thrombus was done. IN SUMMARY: The Behçet's disease is rare disease in children. Intracardiac thrombus and bilateral pulmonary artery aneurysms are rare complications. Medical treatment (immunosupressive and anticoagulation) is the first line therapy with resolution of the mucous, skin, cardiac and pulmonary manifestations.
