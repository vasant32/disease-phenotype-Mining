A 47-year-old man with long-standing Behçet's syndrome presented with an acute abdomen, and was found to have perforation of the sigmoid colon. Laparotomy revealed gangrenous changes in the sigmoid colon and perforation in the center of the affected segment. This is a very rare complication of Behçet's disease, and we report this case to stress the importance of performing careful abdominal examination while evaluating patients with Behçet's disease.
