Two rare cases of complicating valvular lesions in Behçet's disease are reported. Case 1: A 45-year-old man with combined aortic and mitral regurgitation had perforation of both valves. Six months after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and mitral valvuloplasty, an aortic paravalvular leak developed again, and was treated by surgery using an artificial graft with a prosthetic aortic valve. Case 2: A 40-year-old man with congestive heart failure and inflammatory signs had aortic and mitral regurgitation. Although cardiac medications for heart failure and treatment with methylprednisolone were started, he eventually had successful aortic valve replacement. Valvular disease complicating Behçet's disease is rare; only 15 cases, including our two, have so far been reported. Its rarity is partly because Behçet's disease predominantly involves the venous system, not the arterial system.
