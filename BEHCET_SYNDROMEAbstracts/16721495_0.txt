In western countries, when a child presents with recurrent oral ulcers and colitis, the diagnosis of Crohn's disease is mostly made. In our patient, the diagnosis was Behçet's disease with gastrointestinal manifestations. Behçet's disease with gastrointestinal manifestations has a similar clinical presentation to Crohn's disease, but there is more organ involvement and the prognosis is more severe in the former. Because there is limited experience in the treatment of Behçet's disease in the paediatric population, successful and unsuccessful treatment modalities in both paediatric and adult populations should be reported.
