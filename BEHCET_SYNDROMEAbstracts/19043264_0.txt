We report a case of a 52-year-old woman with Behcet's disease who presented with dysarthria and right-sided hemiparesis. T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed a hyperintense lesion in the left pons with a relatively decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Imaging showed almost complete resolution of the lesion after treatment with prednisolone. The atypical DWI and ADC findings in this case may reflect cytotoxic edema due to excitotoxic brain injury. This case thus illustrates the radiological diversity of neuro-Behcet's lesions.
