Colchicine is used in the treatment of gouty arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, amyloidosis, Behcet disease and dermatoses. Myoneuropathy is a rare side-effect reported either with intoxication or in elderly patients with chronic renal insufficiency causing elevated plasma drug levels. We report the first two cases of myoneuropathy in children, both taking appropriate doses of colchicine, and having normal renal function. The myoneuropathic changes were reversible after stopping treatment. The cause of colchicine myoneuropathy is unclear. CONCLUSION: In children treated with colchicine, neuromuscular phenomena of unknown aetiology may be related to the drug, even with a lack of intoxication or renal insufficiency.
