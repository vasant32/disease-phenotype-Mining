Intracardiac thrombus formation is exceptional in Behçet's disease (less than 50 cases had been reported). Among 180 patients with Behçet's disease (according to the criteria of the international study group for Behçet's disease), three were diagnosed as having intracardiac thrombus. All were male, the mean age at the time of the diagnosis of the intracardiac thrombus was 27 years and the mean disease duration was 4.8 years. The presenting symptom was hemoptysis in two patients and heart failure in the third. Surgery was the first attempted treatment in two patients but thrombus recurred and resolved after medical treatment. The third patient was given corticosteroids and anticoagulants as the first line treatment. The thrombus did not resolve and the patient declined surgery. Intracardiac thrombus formation should be considered when a young Behçet's disease patient presents with an intracardiac mass. Medical treatment including corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs and anticoagulants should be considered as the first line treatment and surgery should be considered when there is no resolution of the thrombus or when it becomes massive and extensive. In certain cases, thrombolytic treatment becomes an interesting alternative to surgery.
