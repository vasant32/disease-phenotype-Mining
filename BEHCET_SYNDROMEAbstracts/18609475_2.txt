PURPOSE: To study the clinical characteristics of a cohort of Spanish patients diagnosed with Behcet disease and who also presented ocular inflammation. METHODS: Thirty cases of Beh√ßet disease were studied retrospectively. The authors studied age distribution, distribution by sex, clinical course, laterality, type of uveitis, secondary glaucoma, corneal involvement, hypopyon, iris-lens synechiae, secondary cataract, cystoid macular edema (CME), and papillitis (optic neuritis). RESULTS: Fourteen of the patients were men and 16 were women (ratio 0.875:1). The mean age of the patients was 35.24 years (+/-10.917; 21-61 years). In 23 patients, the disease course was recurrent. In 9 patients, the disease manifested unilaterally. In 5 patients showing unilateral onset, the contralateral eye became affected. In 2 of the 30 patients, uveitis exclusively affected the anterior segment. In 8 patients, uveitis was solely posterior. There was one case of intermediate uveitis. The remaining 19 patients showed panuveitis. Three had focal chorioretinitis. One had diffuse chorioretinitis. Fifteen showed signs of diffuse vasculitis. Eight patients showed focal vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS: Women were slightly more affected than men, although the authors found no significant correlation between sex and the clinical variables examined. Apart from one unexpected case of intermediate uveitis, the observations are similar to those reported for other patient series.
