In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether tissue Doppler imaging could provide more information than standard echocardiography about left and right ventricular functions and their relations to homocysteine and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the course of Behcet's disease (BD). In the right ventricle, patients with BD had lower early diastolic tricuspid annular velocity and early diastolic/late diastolic tricuspid annular velocity ratios than the control group. Mitral and tricuspid annular systolic velocities did not significantly differ; however, diastolic velocities were correlated with duration of the disease. In addition, early/late diastolic mitral annular velocity ratio and early/late diastolic tricuspid annular velocity ratios showed an inverse relation with ocular involvement, serum homocysteine, and CRP levels in patients with BD.
