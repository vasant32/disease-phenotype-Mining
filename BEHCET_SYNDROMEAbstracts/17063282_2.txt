Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, affecting multiple organs. Neurological involvement is one of the most devastating manifestations of BD and may be fatal. We report a 36-year-old woman with neuro-Behçet who was treated with low-dose pulse cyclophosphamide (St. Thomas' protocol) and methylprednisolone, with almost complete clinical remission.
