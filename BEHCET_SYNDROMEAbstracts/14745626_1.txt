A 50-year-old man with Beh√ßet's disease and a history of aortobifemoral (ABF) bypass grafting for an abdominal aortic aneurysm was admitted to our Emergency Room with ileus. Upon exploration we found that the ABF graft was occluding the jejunal passage. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such case ever to be reported.
