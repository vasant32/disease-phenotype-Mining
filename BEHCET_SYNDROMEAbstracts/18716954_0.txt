 PURPOSE: To describe a patient with Behcet disease who developed a pathergy-like reaction following intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 30-year-old man with a history of Behçet disease received an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide for the treatment of cystoid macular edema. The following day, he was noted to have erythematous swelling around the injection site. The lesion disappeared spontaneously within 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Pathergy-like reaction to minor trauma may develop not only on the skin but also in the mucous membranes such as conjunctiva in patients with Behçet disease.
