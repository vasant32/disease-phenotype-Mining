Coronary artery disease is rare in patients with Takayasu's arteritis or Behcet's disease. We report the case of a patient with concomitant Takayasu's arteritis and Behcet's disease who had angina pectoris develop due to severe narrowing of the left main coronary artery. The patient underwent revascularization with saphenous vein grafts with the assistance of the PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System (Cardica, Inc, Redwood City, CA). In conclusion, the PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System seems to be a safe and effective method of facilitating revascularization, particularly when severe calcification of the ascending aorta precludes cross-clamping during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
