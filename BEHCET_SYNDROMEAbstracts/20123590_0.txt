Behcets aortitis is a rare, but one of the most severe complications of Behcets disease. We report a 24-year old woman who was noted initially to have aortitis and severe aortic regurgitation caused by Behcets disease. After receiving aortic valve replacement, aortoplasty and immunosuppressant therapy, her condition became stationary. As far as we are aware, she is the youngest case that has undergone surgery. The early onset of hemodynamic decompensation is considered to be related to delay in diagnosis and lack of steroid treatment.
