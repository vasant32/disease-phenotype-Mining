Neurologic manifestations of Behçet's disease (neuro-Behçet's disease) are uncommon, but may cause patients significant morbidity and mortality. Neuro-Behçet's disease is chronic and may be refractory to treatment. We report on a 12-year-old girl with neuro-Behçet's disease that responded to standard doses of subcutaneous adalimumab.
