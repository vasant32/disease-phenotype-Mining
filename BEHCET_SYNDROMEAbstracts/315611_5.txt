Albuminemia, calcemia, phosphoremia and alcaline phosphatasemia were measured in three groups of 52 subjects each : rheumatoid arthrits, inflammatory rheumatisms other than rheumatoid arthritis and lumbarthrosics serving as a reference group. Calcemia and albuminemia were significantly lower in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, whose calcemia corrected in relation to albuminemia is, on the other hand, normal : the increase in corrected calcemia pointed out by Kennedy, was not noted. Corrected calcemia was also normal in ankylosing spondylitis, but it was significantly higher in polymyalgia rheumatica. Phosphoremia was shown to be normal but alkaline phosphatases were higher than normal in the three groups.
