 OBJECTIVE: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) with arterial involvement is closely correlated with mortality and morbidity due to life-threatening complications such as arterial occlusion and aneurysm rupture. We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of BD patients with aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms in the major arterial systems. METHODS: Medical records of 30 BD patients diagnosed with aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms in the major arterial systems were reviewed to determine the clinical characteristics of BD, the sites and types of arterial aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms, laboratory test results, and response to treatment. RESULTS: A total of 47 aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms (32 saccular aneurysms, eight fusiform aneurysms, and seven pseudoaneurysms) were detected in 30 patients. Most aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms (27 patients, 90%) had not ruptured. Symptomatic lesions presented in 21 patients (70%), and asymptomatic lesions were incidentally detected in nine (30%). Ten of the 30 patients (33.3%) presented two or more aneurysmal lesions. Recurrence was observed in five patients (16.7%) after treatment with stent graft (n = 3), graft interposition (n = 1), or graft embolization (n = 1). CONCLUSION: We suggest that BD patients diagnosed with major arterial aneurysms should be further evaluated to detect possible associated venous or arterial thrombosis formations or aneurysmal lesions at other sites.
