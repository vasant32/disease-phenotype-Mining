Behçet's disease, as initially described, is a triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcers and relapsing uveitis. Classified as a systemic vasculitis, it can involve both the arteries and veins of almost any organ. Intestinal Behçet's disease is characterized by deep ulcers, most commonly located in the ileoceal region, with tendency to bleeding and perforation at multiple sites. Here, we report a case of Behçet's disease presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, mesenteric arterial thrombosis and duodenal perforation.
