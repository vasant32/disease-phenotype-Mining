Pulmonary artery aneurysm in Behcet disease compromises seriously the diagnosis since its fatal rupture is still the major cause of death in this disease. Pulmonary artery aneurysm requires urgent management and several treatments have been proposed, including steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, embolisation and surgery. Herein, we report a patient with Behçet's disease in whom multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms were completely resolved after a combined treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine. Pulmonary artery aneurysms in Behçet's disease are reported to indicate poor prognosis and high mortality. Computed tomographic scans of the chest and angiography are the most common diagnostic procedures used in the diagnosis or evaluation of pulmonary artery aneurysm. Immunosuppression is the main therapy for the treatment of a vasculitis.
