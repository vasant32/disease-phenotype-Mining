OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the value of duplex and color Doppler sonography in the detection of ocular involvement in Behçet's disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Duplex and color Doppler sonography was done in 21 patients with Behçet's disease and ocular involvement and in 22 patients with Behçet's disease but without ocular involvement. Twenty health volunteers also were examined as a control group. Flow velocities in the central retinal artery, posterior ciliary arteries, and ophthalmic artery were measured in the patients with Behçet's disease. RESULTS: In patients with Behçet's disease and ocular involvement, peak systolic velocities in the central retinal, posterior ciliary, and ophthalmic arteries were 7.3 +/- 2.3, 12.8 +/- 3.1, and 35.8 +/- 7.2 cm/sec, respectively. In patients with Behçet's disease but without ocular involvement, these values were 10.0 +/- 1.9, 17.3 +/- 3.4, and 33.5 +/- 4.0 cm/sec, respectively. In control subjects, the respective calculated values were 12.3 +/- 1.0, 16.5 +/- 1.6, and 35.8 +/- 4.4 cm/sec. For the central retinal and posterior ciliary arteries, peak systolic and diastolic velocities were significantly lower in patients with Behçet's disease and ocular involvement than in control subjects and patients with Behçet's disease but without ocular involvement (p < .001). Peak systolic and diastolic velocities in the central retinal artery were significantly lower in patients with Behçet's disease but without ocular involvement than in the control group (p < .001); however, no difference was observed for the posterior ciliary artery. Flow velocities in the ophthalmic artery were not significantly different among groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that duplex and color Doppler sonography may be helpful in the diagnosis of ocular involvement in patients with Behçet's disease.
