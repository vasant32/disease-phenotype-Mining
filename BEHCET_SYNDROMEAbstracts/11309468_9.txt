Cerebral aneurysms in Behçet's disease are very rare. The role of vasculitis in the aetiology of these aneurysms has not been clarified. A 57 year old man with Behçet's disease is described, who had a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a peripheral middle cerebral artery aneurysm. He underwent a successful aneurysmal clipping. Three years later he had seizures and was found to have a new aneurysm on the contralateral peripheral middle cerebral artery as well as some radiological features of vasculitis. After 3 months of steroid therapy, the aneurysm disappeared. Although surgical treatment is the first choice for ruptured aneurysms, steroid therapy may be effective for unruptured small aneurysms in patients with Behçet's disease.
