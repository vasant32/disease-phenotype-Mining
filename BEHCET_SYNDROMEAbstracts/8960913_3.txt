To evaluate the influence of the MHC-linked LMP7 gene on disease susceptibility in HLA class I and class II-associated diseases, the distribution of LMP7 alleles was determined using the PCR-RFLP method in 69 Japanese patients with Behçet's disease, 65 patients with sarcoidosis, and 100 unrelated healthy controls. No differences were found between either of the patient groups and the healthy control group, indicating that LMP7 allelic variation may not contribute to the pathogenesis of either Behçet's disease or sarcoidosis. We also analyzed linkage disequilibria between LMP7 and HLA class II alleles in Japanese populations.
