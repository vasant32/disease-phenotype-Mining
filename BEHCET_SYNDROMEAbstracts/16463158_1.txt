Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) could be a candidate gene for BehÃ§et's disease (BD). This study investigated the relationship of the eNOS Glu298 --> Asp polymorphism with the presence and severity of BD in the Turkish population. Ninety-two patients with BD and 100 controls were studied. Analyses of Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of the eNOS gene were made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The frequencies of the eNOS genotypes were similar for BD patients (GG:GT:TT = 58.7%:38%:3.3%) and controls (59.2%:33.7%:7.1 %), P = 0.335. No evidence of difference was found in the frequency of the T allele between BD patients (22.3%) and controls (24%), [OR = 0.91, 95% CI (0.55-1.50), P = 0.690]. Glu298 --> Asp polymorphism of the eNOS gene does not appear to be associated with the presence of BD in the Turkish population.
