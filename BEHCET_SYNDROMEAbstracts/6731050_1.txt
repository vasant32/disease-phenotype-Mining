A 25-year-old previously healthy man developed complete Beh√ßet's syndrome during five weeks. His main complaint was diarrhea with blood. Ulcers resembling aphthous ulcers of the mouth were revealed in the transverse, left and sigmoid colon by X-ray and sigmoidoscopy. Prednisone therapy was initiated and resulted in complete clinical restitution within three weeks.
