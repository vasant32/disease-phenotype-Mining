 OBJECTIVE: To report the long-term mortality in patients with Behçet's disease (BD). METHODS: A cohort of 817 patients fulfilling the international criteria for BD from a single center in France were analyzed for causes of death, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and the factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: Among the 817 patients with BD, 41 (5%) died after a median followup of 7.7 years, of whom 95.1% were male. The mean ± SD age at death was 34.8 ± 11.9 years. Main causes of death included major vessel disease (mainly, arterial aneurysm and Budd-Chiari syndrome) (43.9%), cancer and malignant hemopathy (14.6%), central nervous system involvement (12.2%), and sepsis (12.2%). The mortality rate at 1 year and 5 years was 1.2% and 3.3%, respectively. There was an increased mortality among patients ages 15-24 years (SMR 2.99, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.54-5.39) and those ages 25-34 years (SMR 2.90, 95% CI 1.80-4.49) as compared with age-and sex-matched healthy controls. The mortality decreased in patients older than age 35 years (SMR 1.23, 95% CI 0.75-1.92). In multivariate analyses, male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 4.94, 95% CI 1.53-16.43), arterial involvement (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.90), and a high number of BD flares (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.09-5.14) were independently associated with the risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The overall mortality in our BD cohort was 5% after a median followup of 7.7 years. Male sex, arterial involvement, and the number of flares were associated with mortality in BD.
