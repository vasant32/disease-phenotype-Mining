We previously reported that the chemotactic response of granulocytes from the patients with Behcet's disease is higher than normal neutrophils. In this study we examined the mechanism by which neutrophils from the patients with Behcet's disease were hyperchemotactic. Normal and patients' leukocytes were disrupted in hypertonic sucrose, sonicated and the supernate was examined. The extracts from the disrupted Behcet's neutrophils increased the normal granulocyte response to the chemotactic stimulus more strongly than extracts from normal cells. This active substance was localized mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction of leukocytes. The fact that Behcet's neutrophils have a higher concentration of the cytoplasmic activator might play an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperchemotaxis.
