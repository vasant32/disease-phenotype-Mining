OBJECTIVES: Pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is a clinical condition characterized by signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache and papilledema. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 62 patients diagnosed with PC, who were on follow-up for a period ranging from 4 to 60 months, were investigated retrograde from 1990 to 1998 and then anterograde from 1998 to 2001 to find out the etiological factors, symptoms and signs and the prognosis in the western part of Turkey. RESULTS: There were 47 (76%) women and 15 (24%) men. The age of onset of symptoms was 32.7 +/- 9.9 (range 18-56) years. Obesity was found in only 17 (30%) of them. There were eight patients (13%) with venous sinus thrombosis causing PC. Five patients (8%) had Behçet's disease. The most common symptom was headache, recorded in 93% of the patients, which was followed by transient visual obscurations (60%). Snellen visual acuity was disturbed in 17 patients (27%) at the initial visit. Visual loss determined by automated perimetry was present in 71% of the cases. Three patients (3%) became blind in both eyes. Of the 62 patients, 41 were on follow-up during the study. Twenty-one (51%) showed regression of the visual field grade, nine patients (22%) worsened and 11 (27%) were stationary. CONCLUSION: Obesity was not as frequent as reported in western countries but Behçet's disease was found to be a frequent cause. Perimetry was the most reliable method to follow-up the patients.
