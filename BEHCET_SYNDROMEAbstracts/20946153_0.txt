 INTRODUCTION: There are no studies on the sexual function of male patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD), but it is probable that male sexual dysfunction may be seen in this chronic condition. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of BD on male sexual function and psychiatric status, and to examine the relationship between sexual function and depression in this population. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of BD for at least one year were included in the study. The patients' age, educational level, and duration of disease were recorded. A healthy control group was selected with highly similar characteristics to the patient group. The sexual functions of the patient and the control groups were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Functions (IIEF), and their emotional status was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The results of the questionnaires in patient and control groups were compared. The relationship between the clinical findings and questionnaire scores was assessed in the patient group. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with BD and 42 healthy individuals were included in the study. The mean subscale scores of the IIEF for erectile function were significantly lower in the patient group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). The IIEF score was not related to active skin findings, active oral ulcers, active genital ulcers, eye involvement, or medication for BD, but it was related with history of arthritis. The BDI and IIEF scores were negatively correlated in the patient group. CONCLUSION: BD has a negative impact on men's psychological state and sexual function. We recommend that depression and sexual dysfunction be investigated and treated while assessing patients with BD.
