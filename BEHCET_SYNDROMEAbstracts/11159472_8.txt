BACKGROUND/AIMS: Diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis is difficult, particularly the retinal vasculitis type, because most cases occur without concurrent active pulmonary tuberculosis. Recently, it has been reported that detection of antibodies against purified cord factor (trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate, TDM), the best studied, most antigenic, and most abundant cell wall component of tubercule bacilli, is very useful for rapid serodiagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. In this study, an attempt was made to evaluate whether the detection of anticord factor antibody is also useful for diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis and the necessity of antituberculous therapy for tuberculous retinochoroiditis was discussed. METHODS: Cases consisted of 15 patients with uveitis and retinal vasculitis, nine patients with presumed ocular tuberculosis, three patients with sarcoidosis, and three patients with Behçet's disease. IgG antibodies against purified cord factor prepared from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: All cases of clinically presumed ocular tuberculosis were positive, whereas all of the cases of sarcoidosis or Behçet's disease were negative for anticord factor antibodies. When the anticord factor antibody titres were compared on the basis of the presence or absence of previous antituberculosis chemotherapy, the mean anticord factor antibody titre of the untreated group showed a tendency to be higher than in the treated group, but not significantly (p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of anticord factor antibody may be useful to support the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis. Additionally, a positive result for anticord factor antibody may indicate that tubercule bacilli are present in some organ(s) of the patient even in the absence of active systemic disease.
