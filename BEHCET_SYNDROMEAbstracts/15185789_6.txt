 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of phacoemulsification cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation in patients with Behçet's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was based on 40 eyes of 34 patients with Behçet's disease who underwent phacoemulsification cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation between May 2000 and February 2003. Their postoperative ocular complications and visual outcomes were observed during a mean follow-up period of 18.35 +/- 6.17 months (range, 6 to 32 months). RESULTS: Postoperative visual acuity increased in 29 eyes (72.5%) and was 20/40 or better in 18 eyes (45%). It decreased in 7 eyes (17.5%), resulting in a visual acuity of 20/400 or worse. The most frequent postoperative complication was posterior capsular opacification, which developed in 15 eyes (37.5%). Other complications were posterior synechiae formation in 7 eyes (17.5%), severe inflammation in 5 eyes (12.5%), cystoid macular edema in 5 eyes (12.5%), epiretinal membrane in 3 eyes (7.5%), and optic atrophy in 2 eyes (5%). CONCLUSION: With appropriate preoperative and postoperative suppression of inflammation, phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation are safe procedures leading to visual improvement in patients with Behçet's disease without preexisting fundus lesions.
