A 69-year-old man visiting our hospital with an epigastralgia and tarry stool was diagnosed as having Behçet's disease on the basis of repetitious aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum and arthralgia in 1991. The next year, he suffered from double active ulcers in the antrum of the stomach, and he had been operated on for intestinal perforation. In 1994, endoscopic examination revealed the gastric mucosal bridge between the double ulcers. The double ulcer healed after an eradication therapy of H. pylori, but the gastric mucosal bridge has remained there on the gastrointestinal endoscopy. The gastric mucosal bridge with Behçet's disease has not been reported in Japan, being considered to be very rare.
