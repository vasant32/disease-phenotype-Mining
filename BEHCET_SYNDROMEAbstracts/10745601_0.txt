We describe a patient with Behcet's syndrome who had peripheral vascular disease involving the left subclavian artery for which angioplasty with stent placement was performed and reangioplasty done for in-stent restenosis. She presented with recurrence one year after stent placement; angiography revealed diffuse disease of the axillary and radial arteries with mild to moderate restenosis at the site of stent placement.
