 PURPOSE: Thalidomide is an effective treatment for recurrent aphthosis but its effectiveness at low dose has been rarely assessed. METHODS: Single-centre non-randomized retrospective open study. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were treated with thalidomide for recurrent aphthosis (41 patients) or Beh√ßet disease (six patients). Remission was obtained with a dose of 25 mg daily. Discontinuation of treatment for side effects was not observed in this case series. CONCLUSION: Low dose thalidomide below 50 mg daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment of aphthosis.
