PURPOSE: Posterior segment involvement, which can lead to blindness with recurrent inflammatory attacks, has a very important prognostic value in ocular Beh√ßet's disease (BD). This study evaluated the frequency and characteristics of posterior segment involvement and the causes of visual impairment in patients with ocular BD. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 257 eyes of the 131 patients who were followed from 1993 to 2001 in the Uveitis and BD division of SSK Ankara Eye Hospital, Turkey. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 49.2 +/- 27.4 months. Thirty-one of the palents were female (23.6%) and 100 male (76.4%). The mean age was 25.1 +/- 7.9. Fundus changes were observed in 213 (82.9%) eyes and were bilateral in 87%, and vitritis was present in 239 (93%) eyes. The most frequent fundus changes were vascular sheathing in 61 eyes (23.7%), optic atrophy in 46 (17.9%), macular edema in 29 (11.3%), retinal hemorrhage in 23 (9%), macular scar in 21 (8.2%), optic disc paleness in 19 (7.4%), retinal edema in 17 (6.6%), branch retinal vein occlusion in 15 (5.8%). The most common fluorescein angiography findings were diffuse vascular leakage in 98 (38%), hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in 38 (14.8%) and hyperfluorescence of the macula in 29 eyes (11.3%). Visual acuity was <1/10 in 85 (33%) of the eyes. Optic atrophy was the main cause (54.1%) of permanent visual impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior segment involvement is the most serious ocular complication of BD, leading to blindness with recurrent attacks. Following patients closely, performing fluorescein angiography in all patients diagnosed as BD even they have no clinical ocular involvement, and early treatment are very important in the prognosis of the disease.
