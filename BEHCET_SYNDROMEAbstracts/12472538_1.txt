Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disease of unknown aetiology characterized by chronic relapsing oro-genital ulcers, uveitis, and systemic involvement including articular, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, neurologic and vascular pathology. Vascular involvement is observed in 30% of cases. Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the thrombotic disposition in BD are not well known, prothrombin (PT) gene mutations may be one factor that contributes to the development of vascular involvement in this disorder. We report a case of BD with a PT gene mutation, presenting with cardiovascular involvement.
