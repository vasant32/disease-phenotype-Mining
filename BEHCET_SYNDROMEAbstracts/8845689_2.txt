We report a case of a young man suffering from both ankylosing spondylitis and Behçet's disease in whom the character of the ocular involvement changed according to the predominant disease at a given time. When the clinical picture was one of ankylosing spondylitis, only anterior uveitis was observed, while the clinical picture of Behçet's disease occurred with panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the English literature of two different patterns of ocular involvement in the same patient with two seronegative arthritides.
