 PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (ivTA) injection in the management of cystoid macular edema (CME) due to uveitis in patients with Behçet's disease. METHODS: Ten eyes of seven patients with CME associated with Behçet's disease were included in the study. A quantity of 4 mg of triamcinolone acetonide was injected intravitreally in all of the eyes. The maculas of the patients were evaluated with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA). The change in visual acuity, fluorescein leakage, macular thickness, and potential complications were assessed. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 15.6 months (range 7-19 months). There was an increase of more than two Snellen lines in the visual acuity in seven of the ten eyes (70%) at the last examination. Macular edema regressed completely in eight of the ten eyes (80%) at the last visit on OCT and FA. The mean central macular thickness assessed by OCT was 406 mum before treatment and 186.9 mum at the last visit. The intraocular pressure (IOP) exceeded 21 mmHg in six eyes of five patients (60%) during the follow-up. At the last visit, the IOP was less than 21 mmHg in five eyes with medication. One eye underwent glaucoma filtration surgery. Four eyes of three patients had cataract progression. In four eyes of four patients (40%), a second ivTA injection was given due to relapsing CME. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (ivTA) may be beneficial in the management of CME in patients with Behçet's disease. Repeated ivTA injections might be required if CME reoccurs.
