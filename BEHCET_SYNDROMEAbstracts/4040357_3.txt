We studied the plasminogen activator levels in plasma samples of 37 patients with Behcet's syndrome. A significant decrease of plasminogen activator activity level was shown by the euglobulin lysis time method, the amidolytic activity level (Testzym method), and the fibrin plate method. Such a decrease may be associated with the severity of Behcet's syndrome.
