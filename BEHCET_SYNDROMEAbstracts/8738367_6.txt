Behçet's disease, a rare condition in central Europe but more common in Turkey where it was originally described, is characterized clinically by the presence of a diagnostic triad of oral and genital aphthous ulcers, meningitis, and relapsing iridocyclitis. Vascular lesions including arterial and venous occlusions, arterial aneurysms and varices are one of the common complications of Behçet's disease occur most commonly in the abdominal aorta, femoral arteries and pulmonary arteries. There have been only four reports of aneurysms of cerebral arteries in the literature. The authors describe a patient with Behçet's disease who suffered secondary subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery 3 years after the initial diagnosis. This case report draws further attention to this rare entity in patients with Behçet's disease.
