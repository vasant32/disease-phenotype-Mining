 PURPOSE: To analyze anatomoclinic and evolutive aspects of the renal involvement associated to the Behçet's disease through 6 observations collected in the nephrology department from 1985 to 2000 and to make a review of the literature. METHODS: Retrospective study, diagnosis of Behçet's disease according to the Classification of the International Group Study on the Behçet's disease and renal damage confirmed by histology. RESULTS: Our patients all male are aged between 25 to 55 years with a mean at 34 years old. The renal damage was revelated by a nephrotic syndrome in 3 cases and by a proteinuria at 1 to 2.7 g/day in 3 cases. Microscopic hematuria was present in 2 cases and arterial hypertension in 2 cases. The renal insufficiency has been noted in 2 cases of which severe in one of them. The renal biopsy showed an amyloidosis AA type in 3 cases, a segmental and focal glomerulonephritis in 2 cases and a thrombotic microangiopathy associated to a moderate tubulo-interstitiel lesions by toxicity of ciclosporine in 1 case. The extrarenal signs were dominated by bipolar aphtosis in all cases, necrotic pseudofolliculitis and the no specific cutaneous hyperreactivity in 5 cases and the erythema nodosum in 1 case. The ocular manifestation has been noted in 4 cases and articular manifestation in 3 cases. The vascular manifestation has been noted in one case. The treatment was colchicine in 4 cases and prednisone and cyclophosphamide in 1 case. Three patients were lost of view and a patient died in hemodialysis. The 2 other patients with amylosis had persistent proteinuria with a normal renal function. CONCLUSION: The kidney is one of organs that can alter the prognosis of the Behçet's disease; so, its screening must be realised in each patient with this disease.
