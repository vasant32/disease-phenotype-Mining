Behcet's syndrome is reported in two families (one English and the other Egyptian). A mother and two of her sons of the English family and two brothers of the Egyptian family are described. The contradictory opinions concerning the incidence of the familial occurrence of this syndrome are partly due to uncertainty about the nosologic relationship of recurrent aphthal and Behcet's syndrome. The question of whether this syndrome should be included in a large group of aphthoses or be regarded as a true clinical entity is discussed.
