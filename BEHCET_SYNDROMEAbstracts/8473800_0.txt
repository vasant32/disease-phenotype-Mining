This is the case report of a 52 years old female patient operated with Cabrol's method for the inflammatory lesion of the aortic root in Behçet's disease. The diagnosis of incomplete type of Behçet's disease had already been established 4 years ago and the patient had been taking regular check-up since then. About one year ago, newly developed cardiac murmur compatible with aortic regurgitation was detected and the patient was subsequently referred to us for the surgical repair. Although aortic valve replacement (AVR) was attempted first, Cabrol's method was lastly chosen, since inflammatory features on the surface of the ascending aorta associated with slight aortic annular dilatation were observed during the procedure and it was easily anticipated that these might induce postoperative paravalvular leakage and pseudoaneurysm, if AVR were performed. Two weeks after the surgery, the patient developed aphthous stomatitis associated with several other evidences of inflammatory recurrence, the steroid therapy was instituted with prednisolone. Post operative progress was uneventful and the patient has been completely well at the 6th month after the surgery. In conclusion, it is strongly recommended the Cabrol's method should be chosen to prevent post operative unfavourable complications, whenever any evidence of inflammation is observed around the aortic root area.
