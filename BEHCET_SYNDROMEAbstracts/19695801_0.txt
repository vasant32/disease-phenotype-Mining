A 30-year-old man had complete-type Behçet's disease since he was 23 years old. Disease signs and symptoms were well controlled. After experiencing no symptoms for some years, however, he experienced dizziness, headache, fever, dysarthria, right facial nerve palsy, and right tinnitus. He showed spontaneous horizontal-rotatory nystagmus directed toward the right side, and upbeat nystagmus. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI showed slight hyperintense signals in the medulla oblongata, pons, and left midbrain. Neurological involvement in Behçet's disease was diagnosed.
