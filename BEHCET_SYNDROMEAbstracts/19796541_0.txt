A case of Sweet's syndrome (SS) associated with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is presented. A 42-year-old Chinese woman was admitted for an eruption of tender, erythematous papules over the neck, which histological changes were typical of SS. She had a three-year history of oral and genital ulcers that was in remission for two months, but flared shortly after the eruption. SS in association with BD has been reported only in few cases. On reviewing the literature, some overlapping manifestations exist between BD and SS and it is possible that some common pathogenesis pathways may be shared by BD and SS.
