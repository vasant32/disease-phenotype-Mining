Thirty patients who fulfilled the criteria for complete and incomplete types of Behçet's syndrome were studied to determine the histopathologic changes of erythema nodosum-like lesions. Lymphocytic vasculitis was observed in 12 (40%) of the cases, but it was only focal in areas of severe lymphocytic inflammation and only mild in degree. No diffuse vasculitis was seen. It is our opinion that the observed lymphocytic vasculitis is only secondary to moderate or severe lymphocytic inflammation. Twelve cases (40%) revealed septal panniculitis, 10 cases (33%) demonstrated lobular panniculitis with moderate to marked inflammation and fat cell necrosis, and 8 cases (27%) showed mild and nonspecific inflammation in the panniculus. Therefore, there is a spectrum of histopathologic changes of erythema nodosum-like lesions in Behçet's syndrome, similar to that of erythema nodosum secondary to other systemic disorders.
