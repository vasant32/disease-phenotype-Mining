Behcet's disease is a complex multisystemic chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by oral and genital aphtous ulcers and vasculitis. Aneurysms of major arteries are the most important cause of mortality in Behcet's disease. Four patients with superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysms related to Behcet's disease have been reported in the literature. We report here the first successful endovascular treatment of a giant, wide-necked SMA aneurysm secondary to Behcet's disease. We performed a balloon-assisted embolization technique using ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx, ev3, Irvine, CA, USA). There were no signs of recurrence during 2-year follow-up.
