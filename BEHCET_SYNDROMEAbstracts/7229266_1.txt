The clinical aspects and course of Beh√ßet's disease in Tunisia are discussed. This affection is of frequent occurrence and should be systematically searched for in all patients with uveitis. Ocular manifestations are observed in 95 p. cent of cases. These are characterized by their polymorphic nature and the diagnosis should be suspected in cases with uveitis, periphlebitis, venous thrombosis, vitreous hemorrhage, congestive glaucoma, or macular edema. The characteristic signs of the disease appear over an extended period of time, making definite diagnosis difficult, but early, vigorous therapy is necessary to ensure a favorable prognosis.
