There are very few reports of Behetaet's disease from India. Familial aggregation of Behetaet's disease has been reported with restricted geographical distribution. We report here familial Behcet's disease from India in two brothers aged 30 and 32 years. Both patients had recurrent oral and genital ulcers for approximately five years. They also had arthralgias on and off along with fever. Pathergy test was positive in both cases. Their younger brother and a sister had recurrent oral aphthous ulcers.
