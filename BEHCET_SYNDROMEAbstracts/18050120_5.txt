PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) are angiogenic mediators that share a significant proinflammatory activity. Both substances have been suggested to play a key role in uveitis pathogenesis. The authors analyzed VEGF and IL-8 levels in the aqueous humor and serum of patients with different types of uveitis during a quiet phase of the disease. METHODS: Thirteen patients with intermediate uveitis, uveitis associated with ankylosing spondylitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, Fuchs uveitis syndrome, idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis, or Behcet disease, as well as 10 normal matched subjects, were included in the study. VEGF and IL-8 concentrations were measured in aqueous humor and serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: VEGF levels were significantly higher in both the aqueous humor and serum of patients with uveitis as compared with controls. IL-8 concentrations in aqueous humor were significantly higher in patients with uveitis with extraocular manifestations than in those with eye-limited disease. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that VEGF plays a role in uveitis pathogenesis even during inactive disease and that IL-8 levels are significantly influenced by the presence of uveitis-associated extraocular changes.
