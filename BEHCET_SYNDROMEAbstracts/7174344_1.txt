Two patients presented with ulcerative lesions of the hypopharynx. One patient developed dysphagia due to a stenotic hypopharynx which followed an ulcerating mucosal lesion. The stenotic site was reconstructed using a subcutaneous pedicle flap. The advantages of this method are possibility of a one-stage operation and a good cosmetic result. In our review of the medical literature, we were unable to find other cases with a similar manifestation treated by surgery. The most likely diagnostic possibilities are Beh√ßet's disease and Crohn's disease. Differential diagnoses are discussed.
