 BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitis disorder of unknown aetiology. Ocular involvement, especially with vasculitis, is detected in up to 80 % of the cases. Anterior segment involvement such as cataract is also seen in the follow-up of patients who are then treated surgically. In this study, we aimed to analyze the outcomes of cataract surgery in patients with Behçet's disease retrospectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 9 patients (12 eyes) with Behçet's disease who underwent phacoemulsification with IOL implantation in 11 eyes and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with IOL implantation in one eye between June 2001 and September 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. The visual outcome and complications were analysed. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 33.8 months (range 3 to 88 months). The mean preoperative LogMAR BCVA was 1.15 ± 0.53 (95 % CI: 0.81 - 1.49) and increased to 0.36 ± 0.32 (95 % CI: 0.15 - 0.56) at last medical visit (p < 0.001). The most frequent postoperative complication was posterior capsular opacification, which developed in 2 eyes (17 %). Other complications were mild fibrinous reaction in 1 eye (8 %). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of cataract surgery in patients with Behçet's disease were satisfactory. The great majority of the patients regained and retained a good visual outcome and had fewer postoperative complications.
