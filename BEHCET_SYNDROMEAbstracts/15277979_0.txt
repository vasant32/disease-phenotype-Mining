Acquired central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare disease due to anatomic lesions of the hypothalamo-pituitary system. We discuss the etiologic and therapeutic aspects of CDI. Through 5 cases and a review of the literature. We report: Two cases of Langerhans histiocytosis, a 21 year old man and a 37 year old women. The CDI was the only endocrine manifestation in the man, but it was associated with panhypopituitarism and infiltration of the thyroid gland by histiocytosis cells in the women. One case of suprasellar germinoma, a 18 year old adolescent had hypocorticism, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism associated with CDI and hyperprolactinemia. One case of pituitary cystic lesion with extension to the suprasellar area, a 36 year old women presenting with hypocorticism, growth hormone deficiency, and hyperprolactinemia. One case of neuro-Beh√ßet's disease in a 47 year old man. He presented with strokes and CDI. When the CDI is isolated Langerhans Histiocytosis should be considered first. The exploration of the hypothalamo-pituitary region using MRI showed different anatomic lesions in patients with CDI. It is very difficult to determine definitive diagnosis before surgery in the cases of cystic lesions.
