Behçet's disease is known to be associated with HLA-B51 in many different populations. Genetic evidence supports that the susceptible gene for Behçet's disease is the HLA-B51 allele at the HLA-B locus. This study was aimed to determine the HLA-B51 nucleotide sequence variation in three Behçet's disease patients and three healthy controls in order to elucidate if any disease specific mutations or polymorphisms may exist in the HLA-B51 gene of patients. Long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was first carried out to give a PCR-amplified product of 9.5 kb which was then used as a template for nested PCR to give a final amplified product of 4.2 kb. This final product containing the 1.3-kb promoter/enhancer region and the entire HLA-B gene except for a 363-bp 3' terminal end segment encoding the 3' untranslated region was subcloned by the BP cloning technique and sequenced. The sequencing results showed that all the patients possessed the HLA-B*51011 allele, and there were no differences in the exonic nucleotide sequences between the three Behçet's disease patients and the three healthy controls. The HLA-B*51011 intronic and promoter/enhancer nucleotide sequences from the three patients had 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a single insertion of 6 bp and a single deletion of 2 bp. On the other hand, the three healthy controls had 24 SNPs in their intronic and promoter/enhancer regions. However, none of these polymorphisms in the patients were specific for the disease. Therefore, these results clearly demonstrate that the HLA-B exonic sequence that encodes the HLA-B51 allele is the real pathogenic factor in Behçet's disease.
