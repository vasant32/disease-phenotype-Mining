BACKGROUND: Behçet disease is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology. T cells in this disease proliferate vigorously in response to a specific peptide of heat shock protein (HSP) 60 in an antigen-specific fashion. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is a cytokine participating in the inflammatory process. One of the prominent features of Behçet disease is vasculitis as a result of endothelial dysfunction. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) may play a role in the development of thrombosis by inhibiting production of prostacyclin by endothelial cells. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of HSP60, VEGF and APA in Behçet disease and their relation to clinical manifestations and disease activity. METHODS: Thirty patients with Behçet disease were included; 17 were in the active stage and 13 were in the inactive. Fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Complete clinical examination and Doppler examination were done. Serum levels of HSP60, VEGF and APA were performed. RESULTS: Serum levels of HSP60, VEGF and APA were significantly higher in patients than in controls; however, their level did not correlate with disease activity. The serum level of VEGF correlated significantly with the presence of vascular manifestations and ocular involvement. The serum level of APA was greater in patients with thrombosis. HSP60 has an important role in aetiopathogenesis of Behçet disease, which sheds new light on its autoimmune nature. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated serum level of VEGF may be a risk factor for the development of ocular disease contributing to poor visual outcome.
