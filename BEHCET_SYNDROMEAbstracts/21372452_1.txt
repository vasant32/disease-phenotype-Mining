Neoplasms rarely arise in the intestinal lesion of Behçet's disease. We present a 77-year-old man with Behçet's disease who developed colon cancer in the ileocecal region. Ileocecal resection was performed and pathological examination of the specimen revealed advanced colon carcinoma (pT3, N1, M0). The lesion was associated with destroyed tunica muscularis and severe fibrosis suggesting a transmural ulcer scar (Ul-IVs). The p53 gene mutation analysis of the tumor showed a heterozygous deletion. This case indicates there is a possibility that cancer may develop in intestinal lesions of patients with Behçet's disease as well as in those with other inflammatory bowel diseases.
