We report 2 patients (35-year-old and 38-year-old men) with neuro-Behçet's disease and characterize their diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) findings of brain. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images obtained during the acute phase of neurological manifestations demonstrated multiple hyperintense lesions with a characteristic distribution in the brain including brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebral hemisphere. Most of these lesions did not exhibit increased signal intensity on DWI. This MRI profile, especially the combination of isointensity on DWI and hyperintensity on T2-weighted image, of neuro-Behçet's disease is similar to that of multiple sclerosis, and different from that of acute cerebral infarction and herpes simplex encephalitis.
