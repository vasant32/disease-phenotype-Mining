Behcet's disease is a vasculitis affecting predominantly the venous system. It's characterized by a classical triad of recurrent uveitis, oral and genital ulceration. Behcet's disease is more frequent in Japan, the Middle East and some Mediterranean countries. Its pathogenesis is still uncertain. Neurological manifestations in Behcet's disease are not rare and are associated with poor prognosis. These manifestations can be inaugural in 5% of cases and they are polymorphous. We report 15 new cases of neuro Behcet's disease explored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).
