OBJECTIVES: Different diagnostic criteria for Behçet's disease are proposed in the literature. We compared the criteria proposed by Mason and Barnes with those proposed by the International Study Group and with those proposed by the Japanese committee. METHODS: This retrospective study included 41 patients with Behçet's disease according to the criteria set by Mason and Barnes. There were 16 patients of French origin and 25 patients of North African origin. RESULTS: Genital ulcerations were more frequent in the North African population (p < 0.007) and typical Behçet skin lesions were more frequent in the French population (p < 0.021). Comparing the clinical data among the 41 patients with Behçet's disease according to the Mason-Barnes criteria revealed that only 83% met the criteria set by the International Study Group and only 54% the criteria of the Japanese committee. For the International Study Group criteria, the requirement for recurrent buccal ulcerations with at least 3 episodes over a 12 month period (a major criteria) was the most limiting element. Likewise, genital ulcerations were not always recurrent. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the variability of clinical manifestations of Behçet's disease with ethnic origin. Proposed diagnostic criteria vary depending on the study committee and should be used as diagnostic guidelines rather than as criteria required for positive diagnosis.
