INTRODUCTION: Colchicine is a treatment used for aphthous stomatitis but its efficacy has never been proved. We report the results of an open trial of 54 patients treated with colchicine for aphthous stomatitis. The aim of our study was to assess the long and short term efficacy and tolerance of this molecule in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The case reports of 64 patients presenting with severe, recurrent aphthous stomatitis treated with colchicine between 1986 and 2000 were analyzed retrospectively. Only immunocompetent patients exhibiting idiopathic aphthous stomatitis or Behçet's disease were included. Ten patients were excluded: 4 cases of Behçet's disease treated with colchicine and systemic corticosteroids, 4 cases of aphthous stomatitis secondary to a hematological cause and 2 patients who were lost to follow-up after 3 month's treatment. Colchicine was prescribed at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/d for at least 3 months. All the patients were assessed after 3 month's treatment and all were contacted by phone in May 2000. Our end-point criteria were: the frequency and duration of the episodes, intensity of pain and impact on the quality of life of the patients. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included: 39 women (mean age=44 +/- 16.8) and 15 men (mean age=49 +/- 13.5). The disease had progressed for a mean of 11.6 +/- 13.5 years. After 3 month's treatment, 12 patients (22 p. 100) no longer had aphta and were in complete remission, 22 patients (41 p. 100) were significantly improved, since the frequency and duration of the lesions had decreased by at least 50 p. 100 and the latter were no longer painful. Treatment failed or tolerance was poor in 20 patients (37 p. 100). Patients were monitored and assessed for a mean of 4.7 years (range: 6 months to 13 years). Six patients were lost to follow-up. Three patients (6 p. 100) were considered as cured, since they were still in complete remission after suspension of colchicine respectively 6, 24 and 72 months later. Fifteen patients (31 p. 100) had still improved. Among the latter, 10 continued colchicine for a mean of 27 months, and 5 patients stopped treatment, which they considered tedious, after a mean of 16 months. These 15 patients noted a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of the lesions. Moreover, the subjective end-point criteria had improved significantly for them not to wish to change treatment. Thirty patients (63 p. 100) were not improved by the treatment. Some benign adverse events were noted in 10 patients (18.5 p. 100) and led to suspension of treatment in 4 cases. DISCUSSION: This study, which is the first in size (n=54) and duration of follow-up (4.7 years), showed that colchicine is an efficient preventive treatment of severe aphthous stomatitis for 63 p. 100 of patients after 3 month's treatment and that this improvement was lasting in 37 p. 100 of them. Colchicine should therefore be proposed in first intention in severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis, since it is effective, well tolerated and easy to use.
