The activities of the lysosomal enzymes of leukocytes were correlated with the types of ocular attacks of Behcet's disease, ie, the anterior or posterior types. No significant correlation was found between the types of attacks and the activities of acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the neutrophils, however, was significantly lower in the posterior type than in the anterior type. In selected cases, the time-course of the MPO activity was studied: the activity decreased at attacks and showed a recovery as the symptoms subsided. The recovery after the attacks was faster in the anterior type than in the posterior type. The difference between the MPO activities in the two types of attacks was thought to be due to the fact that the posterior type attack shows more severe ocular inflammation than the anterior type attack. It is possible that the MPO is released from the neutrophils just before the onset of the ocular attacks.
