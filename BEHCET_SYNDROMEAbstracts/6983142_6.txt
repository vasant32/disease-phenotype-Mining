A 40-year-old man with Behcet's disease had esophageal, ileal, and colonic ulcerations complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation. Ileocolonic resection was followed by recurrence of intestinal ulcerations with peritonitis and death. Gastrointestinal Behcet's disease shows a wide range of sites of involvement and types of lesions. Specific therapy is lacking, and surgical resection of involved organs is complicated by a high recurrence rate.
