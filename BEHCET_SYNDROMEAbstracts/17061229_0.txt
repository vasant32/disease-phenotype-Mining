PURPOSE: To report an unusual incident of isolated conjunctival ulcerations which preceded all other signs of Behçet's disease. METHODS: Description of a 34-year-old woman of West Indian origin with an unremarkable medical history presenting with bilateral bulbar conjunctival ulcerations. RESULTS: The authors noted the presence of a diffuse bilateral conjunctival hyperemia which was more pronounced at the temporal bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye and the nasal conjunctiva of the left eye, each having one ulceration. The rest of the ophthalmologic examination was normal. One month later, the appearance of buccogenital aphthosis led to the diagnosis of Behçet's disease. CONCLUSIONS: This observation is unusual, as the conjunctival ulcerations are isolated and precede the onset of all other symptoms of Behçet's disease. Conjunctival ulcerations are rarely seen with Behçet's disease, but are characteristic enough to be included among the diagnostic criteria.
