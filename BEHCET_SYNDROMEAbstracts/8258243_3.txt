The case of a 49-year-old man affected by Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS) without any clinical or radiological evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, exhibiting a peripheral enthesitis typical of seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA) is reported. The diagnosis of SpA is supported by computed tomographic evidence of sacroiliitis. This case confirms our hypothesis that patients with BS may have other forms of SpA than AS.
