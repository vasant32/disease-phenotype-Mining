We describe two cases of Behçet's disease in a 37-year-old woman and a 40-year-old woman. Each of these patients developed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia associated with Behçet's disease. Both patients developed fever, cough and pleuritic chest pain during follow-up by our out-patient clinic. Chest X-rays and computed tomographies developed ground glass opacity, peripheral nodular opacities and consolidations. There were neither thrombosis nor aneurysm findings. Both cases were diagnosed as having organizing pneumonia. Prednisolone (40-60 mg/day) showed clinical and radiological improvement for both cases. Lung involvement is a rare feature of Behçet's disease, sometimes leading to a poor prognosis. The pulmonary parenchymal involvement still needs to be explored fully to diagnose early and start proper treatment. These two rare cases provide clinical insight into lung involvement in Behçet's disease.
