A patient with downhill azygos venous flow is reported. This reverse flow was due to an obstruction in the superior vena cava and the azygos entry due to Beh√ßet's disease. Color flow mapping of the azygos vein, using transesophageal real-time two-dimensional Doppler echography, was used for both anatomic and hemodynamic analysis.
