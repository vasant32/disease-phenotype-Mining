A 34 year old man with no known coronary risk factors presented with acute myocardial infarction. Shortly after admission, and over the next eight years, he had recurring clinical features consistent with a diagnosis of Beh√ßet's syndrome. Coronary angiograms recorded six months after infarction were normal. Although he was well with maintenance steroid treatment, blood fibrinolysis was impaired. Myocardial infarction has not previously been reported as a presenting feature of the syndrome.
