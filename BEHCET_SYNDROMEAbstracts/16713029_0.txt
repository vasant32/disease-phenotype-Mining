INTRODUCTION: Arterial involvement in Behçet's disease is rare, present in 2-8% of cases. Aortic aneurysms represent the most frequent arterial lesions encountered in this disease and are associated with high mortality. CASE REPORT: We report the exceptional observation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptured to the duodenum, responsible of a massive gastro intestinal bleeding in a patient with Behçet's disease requiring an emergent surgical intervention. The outcome was favorable. DISCUSSION: The clinical presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysms in Behçet's disease is often atypical leading to an important diagnosis delay and favours the rupture of the aneurysm.
