The purpose of this article is to present the spectrum of vascular disease accompanying Behçet's disease. Four cases of the disease with various vascular manifestations are presented. In the first case superior vena cava syndrome due to thrombosis was the presenting symptom. In the second case foot ischemia with toe necrosis was prevalent. In the third case the patient developed recurrent aneurysmal disease in large and medium size arteries requiring successive vascular surgery, and in the fourth case the patient had SVC thrombosis and ruptured femoral aneurysm. All four patients were young males. Although vascular complications of Behçet disease are uncommon they may pose serious therapeutic problems.
