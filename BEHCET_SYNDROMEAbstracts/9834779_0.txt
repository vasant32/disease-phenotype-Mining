BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is a multisystem illness rarely including cardiac involvement. We report a case characterized by a mural cardiac mass in the right ventricle. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old boy presented with a full set of symptoms leading to the diagnosis of Behçet's disease. Echocardiography revealed a 60/120 mm mass in the right ventricle. With anticoagulation therapy, prednisone and cyclophosphamide, the cardiac lesion progressively resolved. DISCUSSION: This observation is exceptional because cardiac mas is rarely described in Behçet's disease. Surgical exploration, which is usually indicated to exclude malignant process, is not necessary in such cases.
