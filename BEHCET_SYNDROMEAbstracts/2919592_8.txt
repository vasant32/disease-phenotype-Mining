A 15-yr-old, Arabic male presented with painful, recurrent, self-resolving oral and genital ulcers, erythema nodosum and uveitis. Behcet's disease was diagnosed. A few months later, he experienced anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Although all routine laboratory and radiologic investigations were negative, colonoscopy revealed the presence of serpiginous ulcers with pseudopolyps and inflamed intervening mucosa in the proximal half of the colon. Therapy with oral steroids was helpful, but the disease exacerbated a few months after prednisone was discontinued. Repeat evaluation showed similar endoscopic findings and, on colonic biopsy, noncaseating granulomas compatible with Crohn's disease were seen. Again, the patient responded well to oral steroids and sulfasalazine. We believe that gastrointestinal involvement in our patient is compatible with Crohn's disease and that screening tests to rule out chronic inflammatory bowel disease should be performed in the presence of gastrointestinal involvement in Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease may be a part of the spectrum of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
