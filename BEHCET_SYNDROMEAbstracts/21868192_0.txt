 INTRODUCTION: Behcet's disease is a systematic vasculitis of unknown cause, characterized essentially by eye, cutaneous, articular, neurological and vascular manifestations. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the Behcet's disease cases that were followed up in our ward from January 2000 to January 2009. The inclusion criteria were those of International Study Group on Behçet's disease (aphthosis mouth was required). Data were retrieved and analysed with two softwares (Access(®) and Epi Info(®)). RESULTS: We observed 30 cases with vascular lesions on a series of 92 patients with Behcet's disease. Most patients were male, with an average age around 40. The venous manifestations, concerning essentially the lower limbs (deep and superficial thrombosis) were found at 27 patients (90 %), and the average of age during the appearance of the venous lesions was 40 years. Arterial lesions appear more late in 13 patients (43 %) (average of age 43 years). We noted, on the other hand, 11 cases of aneurysms and five cases of arterial thrombosis. The use of corticosteroids was necessary in all cases in association with the others drugs (anticoagulants, colchicine, immunosuppressors). Among the patients having had aneurysms, six were treated surgically. The outcome was favorable for most patients. Two patients had pulmonary embolism and two post-surgery complications. One patient died in the consequences of an intragastric break of an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. CONCLUSION: The vascular involvement in Behcet's disease is manifested primarily by thrombophlebitis. Achieving blood pressure, less common, is problematic therapeutic because of the recurrent and life threatening.
