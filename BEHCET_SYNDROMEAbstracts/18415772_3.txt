 OBJECTIVE: We analysed the production of soluble tumour necrosis factor receptors sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 at sites of inflammation and measured their plasma concentrations to evaluate them as biological markers of disease activity. METHODS: Plasma samples of 35 patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) were collected prospectively at monthly intervals and grouped for inactive disease, active BD without arthritis, and active BD with arthritis. sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 concentrations were measured using immunoassays and compared with other biological disease activity parameters. Plasma sTNFR levels were compared to synovial fluid (SF) levels in seven patients. Sixteen tissue samples of mucocutaneous lesions were stained for TNFR2 expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were found at increased plasma concentrations in active BD, with the highest concentration in active BD with arthritis (p<0.001). Concentrations of both sTNFRs were at least three times higher in SF of arthritic joints than in the corresponding plasma samples (p = 0.025). A change of more than 1 ng/mL of sTNFR2 plasma concentrations correlated with a concordant change in arthritic activity (96% confidence interval). Sensitivity to change was superior to that of sTNFR1, and other biological disease activity parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and interleukin (IL)-10 plasma concentrations. A strong staining for TNFR2 was found in mucocutaneous lesions, where mast cells were identified as the major source for this receptor. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study demonstrates that sTNFR2 plasma concentrations are closely linked with active BD, and especially with arthritis. Taken together with the expression of TNFR molecules in mast cells of mucocutaneous lesions, our results indicate a fundamental role for the TNF/TNFR pathway in BD.
