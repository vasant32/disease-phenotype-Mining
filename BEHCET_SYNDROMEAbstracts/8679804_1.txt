Four patients diagnosed with Behçet's disease developing neurologic manifestation are described. Central nervous system findings were observed in three of them and peripheral neuropathy in ther other patient. All the patients were treated with chlorambucil, 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day as initial dose. Three of them ended the immunosuppressive therapy after a period of treatment between 12-18 months. None of the four patients suffered neurologic relapses once that the therapy with chlorambucil was started. In a similar way to other authors, we think that treatment with chlorambucil in neuro-Behçet's disease may be useful to reduce morbility related to neurologic relapses.
