 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 chemokine receptor expression on peripheral blood neutrophils (PBN) and synovial fluid neutrophils (SFN) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Beh√ßet's disease (BD) (characterized by erosive and non-erosive arthritis, respectively), and to compare them with those of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: We used flow cytometry to investigate the expression of CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on PBN and SFN of fifty-five (22 RA, 22 BD and 11 OA) age and sex-matched patients. RESULTS: In respect to chemokine receptor expression on neutrophils isolated from patients with RA, mean fluorescein intensity (MFI) of CXCR-1 chemokine receptors on PBN from active and inactive RA patients, and SFN from patients with RA were 151 (90-395), 129 (81-539) and 136 (64-220), respectively, and there were not statistically significant difference each other. But MFI of CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on SFN of patients with RA was 18 (10-32), and significantly higher than PBN of active and inactive RA patients (MFI: 10 (6-15) and 12 (7-16), P=0.002 and 0.037, respectively). In respect to chemokine receptor expression on neutrophils isolated from patients with BD, MFI of CXCR-1 chemokine receptors on PBN of active BD patients was 245 (97-844), and higher than PBN of active RA patients and SFN of BD patients (MFI: 151 (90-395) and 134 (61-231), P=0.047 and 0.017, respectively). MFI of CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on PBN of active and inactive BD patients, and SFN of patients BD were 10 (6-14), 10 (2-16), and 12 (8-24), respectively, there were not statistically significant difference each other. MFI of CXCR-1 chemokine receptors on SFN from patients with RA, BD, and OA were 136 (64-220), 134 (61-231), and 114 (60-180), respectively, and there was no difference between the study groups. MFI of CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on SFN of patients with RA was 18 (10-32), and higher than patients with BD and OA (MFI: 12 (8-24) and 11 (9-18), P=0.037 and 0.005, respectively), though there was no difference between last two groups. CONCLUSION: Our study points that CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 chemokine receptors of SFN may have diverse functions in the course of inflammatory arthritides. These results indicate that CXCR-2 chemokine receptor might play more critical role in long lasting accumulation of neutrophils within the synovial fluid of patients with RA.
