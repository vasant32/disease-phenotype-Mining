A 29-year-old man presented with oral and genital ulcers, erythematous papules and pustules on his back and chest, and deep vein thrombi. A diagnosis of Behçet disease was made. Behçet disease is a relapsing disorder that affects the mucocutaneous surfaces. It presents usually as ulcers on the orogenital mucosae, but can also present as an acneiform eruption. The International Study Group on Behçet disease has established criteria that consist of oral and genital lesions, ocular involvement, skin findings, and a pathergy. Treatment of choice is colchicine or prednisone.
