BACKGROUND: The analysis of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) is a cytogenetic technique used to show DNA damage as a result of an exchange of DNA fragments between sister chromatids. It is known that there is an increased SCE frequency in Behçet's disease (BD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B51-positive patients with Behçet's disease exhibit higher SCE frequencies than those without HLA-B51. METHODS: Lymphocytes from 75 patients (38 women, 37 men) and from 50 controls (28 women, 22 men) were cultured in darkness for 72 h in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine. Metaphase chromosomes were stained with a fluorescence plus Giemsa technique after a standard harvest procedure. For HLA-B51 typing, DNA was extracted from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood samples and HLA-B5 allele genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence specific primer method. RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 75 patients with BD (52%) and 15 of 50 controls (30%) were found HLA-B51-positive. The SCE frequencies in HLA-B51-positive patients were higher than in HLA-B51-negative ones (P < 0.001), whereas no difference was detected in the control group. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a significant association between elevated SCE frequencies and existence of HLA-B51 patients with BD.
