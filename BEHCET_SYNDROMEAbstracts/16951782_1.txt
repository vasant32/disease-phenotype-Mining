Pseudoaneurysm of the infrarenal aorta due to Behcet s disease is very rare. We report a case of pseudoaneurysm associated with Behcet s disease in a 17-year-old boy with a recurrent right ventricular thrombus successfully treated with revascularization using arterial homograft patch. Echocardiography examination revealed a right ventricular mass, thought to be a thrombus in an unusual location. Postoperatively, the findings of the pathologic examination confirmed the mass as a thrombus. When the patient was subsequently re-admitted to the emergency unit with complaints of severe abdominal pain, fever, fatigue, sinus tachycardia, and a pulsating and tender abdominal mass, a right ventricular thrombus and a large pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta were found on echocardiography and angiography. The patient underwent resection of the aortic aneurysm and aortoplasty, using arterial homograft patch, and received immunosuppressive and anticoagulation therapy. The thrombus of the right ventricle disappeared 4 months later. This case indicates that a right ventricular thrombosis in Behcet s disease may be managed by medical therapy.
