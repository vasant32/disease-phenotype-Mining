Esophageal lesions are rarely seen in patients with intestinal Behçet's disease. Three patients with esophageal lesions (dissection of esophageal mucosa, esophageal ulcer, esophageal varices) were observed among 15 patients with intestinal Behçet's disease or non-specific simple ulcer (1974-1984). Two-thirds of these fifteen patients had fully developed or suspected Behçet's disease, and one-third had no symptoms typical of Behçet's disease. They are classified as non-specific simple ulcer. The average age of the 15 patients was 43 years, all patients but one were male. The recurrence rate after surgical treatment was 70%, that of medical treatment was 90%.
