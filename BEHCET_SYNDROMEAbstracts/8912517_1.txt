Behçet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder which may involve the vascular system. The vasculopathy of Behçet's disease is distinctive among the vasculitides in that it involves both arteries and veins, and vessels of all sizes. Most published diagnostic criteria for Behçet's disease include the classic triad of orogenital ulceration and ocular inflammation. In this report, we describe a patient who had a vasculopathy fitting the Behçet's disease type, but who lacked the other characteristic or diagnostic features of Behçet's disease. This case illustrates an unusual presentation and natural history of a complex vasculitic disease.
