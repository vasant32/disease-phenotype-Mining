 INTRODUCTION: To explore whether the insertion (I) and deletion (D) polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) confers susceptibility to vasculitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the ACE I/D polymorphism and vasculitis. RESULTS: Twelve studies, including four on Behçet's disease (BD), four on Henoch-Schenlein purpura (HSP), three on Kawasaki disease (KD), and one on Wegener's granulomatosis, were available for the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the DD + ID genotype was associated with susceptibility to vasculitis (odds ratio [OR] 1.468, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.214-1.468, p = 7.4 × 10(-5)). The overall OR for the D allele was significantly increased in BD (OR 1.313, 95% CI 1.017-1.695). Meta-analysis of the DD+ID genotype, the DD genotype and the DD vs. II genotype showed marginal associations with BD, but meta-analysis of the D allele, and the DD+ID genotype showed significant associations with HSP (OR 1.446, 95% CI 1.021-2.049, p = 0.038; OR 1.881, 95% CI 1.385-2.595, p = 6.6 × 10(-5)). On the other hand, meta-analysis showed no association between KD and the ACE I/D polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with vasculitis susceptibility, especially in BD and HSP.
