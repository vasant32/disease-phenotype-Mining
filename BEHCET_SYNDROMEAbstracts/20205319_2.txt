BACKGROUND: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is known to be associated with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 in many ethnic groups. However, the association of HLA class II gene with BD has been described to be different according to different countries and regions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the association between polymorphism of HLA-DRB1 alleles and BD. METHODS: Forty patients with BD and 100 healthy controls were typed for HLA-DRB1 alleles by the LABType SSO method. RESULTS: The frequency of HLA-DRB1*14 was significantly higher in BD patients than in controls (P < 0.05), while the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was markedly lower in BD patients (P < 0.05). Regarding clinical manifestations, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly decreased in BD patients with genital ulcerations compared with controls (P < 0.05); the frequency of HLA-DRB1*14 was significantly increased in BD patients with erythema nodosum-like lesions and in BD patients with folliculitis-like lesions when compared to controls (P < 0.05, respectively). Moreover, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*14 was significantly increased in BD patients under 20 years of age at the onset of disease (P < 0.01), while the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly decreased in them (P < 0.05), compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that HLA-DRB1 alleles might play an important role in the onset and clinical manifestations of BD.
