BACKGROUND: Familial Behçet's disease is rare. METHODS: HLA antigens in a Japanese family with Behçet's disease were examined. RESULTS: The affected patients had HLA B51, and unaffected family members also had the same antigen. CONCLUSION: It is likely that not only HLA B51 but also other factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease in Japanese patients.
