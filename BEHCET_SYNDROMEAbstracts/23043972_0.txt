Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disease having a chronic and prolonged course with 4 major symptoms: oral and genital ulcerations, eye disease and cutaneous manifestations, as well as other multisystem involvements. Arterial involvement is a comparatively rare complication in BD and coronary lesions are extremely rare. We report here two cases of BD presenting as myocardial infarction (MI) with coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), with good improvement after immunosuppressive therapy.
