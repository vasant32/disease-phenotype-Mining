PURPOSE: To clarify the nature of infiltrating T cells into the anterior chamber of a patient with Behçet disease. METHODS: Aqueous humor was obtained from a patient with ocular Behçet disease by paracentesis. RNA isolated from the cells in aqueous humor was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA. Complementary DNA encoding the variable (V) diversity (D) joining (J) (junctional) region of T-cell receptor beta chain V domain (TCR BV) chain was amplified by T-cell receptor BV family polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction Southern blot analysis showed that T-cell receptor BV3, BV5, and BV7 were dominantly expressed on ocular T cells of this patient. In addition, DNA sequencing revealed that monoclonal or oligoclonal T-cell accumulation was found in T-cell receptor BV3(+), BV5(+), and BV7(+) T cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that some T cells infiltrating into the anterior chamber of a patient with ocular Behçet disease expand by antigen-driven stimulation, indicating the pivotal role of T cells in the pathogenesis of ocular Behçet disease.
