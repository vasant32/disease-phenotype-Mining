Arterial complications of Behçet's disease are rare and affect mainly the aorta and iliac arteries. Perforation of the arterial wall is the most common lesion, predisposing to false aneurysm or rupture. Open surgical repair is difficult, and anastomotic false aneurysms often occur because of aortic wall fragility. We report here the case of using a bifurcated stent to treat aortoiliac false aneurysms in a 37-year-old patient. Endovascular repair could be an alternative treatment of aneurysmal manifestations in Behçet's disease.
