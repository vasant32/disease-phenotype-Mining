Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with no known treatment. In view of this and of its distressing nature patients are attracted by any new concepts. As a reaction to this neurologists are sometimes excessively sceptical and fail to consider new approaches seriously. Recent attempts have been made to treat multiple sclerosis with polyunsaturated fatty acids and with colchicine. This approach is not arbitrary and is firmly grounded in fundamental basic scientific concepts. In patients with multiple sclerosis there is evidence of both an abnormality in essential fatty acid metabolism and an abnormality in lymphocyte function. It is now apparent that the fatty acid abnormality may cause the lymphocyte abnormality and that both may be improved by dietary manipulation. There is also evidence that the demyelination may be associated with recurrent inflammatory episodes and with entry of calcium into the cytoplasm. In vitro colchicine has been shown to have actions compatible with regulation of cytoplasmic calcium and in two diseases characterised by intermittent inflammatory episodes (Beh√ßets syndrome and familial Mediterranean fever) it has been found to prevent or to reduce the severity of such episodes. Preliminary results suggest that combined therapy with evening primrose oil and colchicine may be of considerable value.
