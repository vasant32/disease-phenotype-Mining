Two necropsy cases of chronic encephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology are presented. Skin hyperreactivity occurred in both cases although there were no mucocutaneo-ocular symptoms. There was confluent perivenous necrosis with marked glio-mesenchymal reactions and persistent inflammatory changes, predominantly in the diencephalon and brain stem. These cases are clinico-pathologically analogous to Neuro-Behcet's syndrome.
