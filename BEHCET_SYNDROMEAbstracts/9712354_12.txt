Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is known to be associated with HLA-B51. In order to investigate the influence of the MICB gene, located about 120 kb centromeric of the HLA-B gene, on the susceptibility to BD, (CA/TG) dinucleotide repeat microsatellite polymorphism in intron 1 of the MICB gene was investigated among 77 Japanese patients with BD, 60 randomly selected controls and 28 HLA-B51-positive unrelated healthy controls. There was no significant difference in the phenotype frequency of the microsatellite polymorphism between the BD patients and controls. This result suggests that the MICB gene itself is not responsible for the development of BD, and that the candidate gene(s) for BD is located between the MICA and HLA-C genes.
