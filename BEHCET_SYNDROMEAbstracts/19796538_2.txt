The association of the cytokine gene polymorphisms with the development of Beh√ßet's Disease (BD) was investigated in this study. DNA samples were obtained from a Turkish population of 97 unrelated patients with BD, and 127 unrelated healthy control subjects.All genotyping (IL-6, IL10, IFN-gamma, TGF-Beta1 and TNF-alpha) experiments were performed using sequence-specific primers PCR. The frequency of TGF-Beta1 codon 25 GG genotype was found significantly lower in BD patients compared to healthy control subjects. The IL-10 -1082 GA genotype was more frequent whereas the AA genotype was less common in the BD group compared to the control group. The association between clinial findings and cytokine gene polymorphisms was further investigated in the patients with BD. The frequency of IFN-gamma AA genotype was lower in the patients with genital ulcer. Additionally, it was found that the frequency of IL-6 -174 GG genotype was lower in the patients with Pathergy positivity. These results suggest that TGF-Beta1 and IL-10 gene polymorphisms may affect host susceptibility to BD. Also, to confirm the biological significance of our results, further studies should be performed on other population groups and in large number of cases.
