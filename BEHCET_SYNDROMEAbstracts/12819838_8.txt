We present a serial study of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in a patient with neuro-Behçet's disease. Initial T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed a hyperintense lesion in the brain stem. The lesion was slightly hyperintense on DWI and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was slightly increased. Ten months later, DWI showed an improvement in the abnormal signal intensity and the region of increased ADC had increased in size, especially on the left side. DWI is useful for differentiating an acute exacerbation of neuro-Behçet's disease from acute infarction.
