Two cases of neuro-Behcet's disease with isolated, solitary fronto-temporal and mesencephalic lesions respectively are reported. The cases were misdiagnosed as cerebral tumor. The postoperative outcome of the first patient was not satisfactory as he developed hemispheric edema. The second patient, with mesencephalic lesion, was treated only with corticosteroids, and the patient improved significantly. The lesion in this case resolved completely at six-month follow-up. We conclude that distinguishing the isolated solitary cerebral lesion of the Behcet's disease from a tumor may prevent surgical intervention.
