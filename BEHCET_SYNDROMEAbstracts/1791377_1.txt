The authors report on a 31 year old man with a generalised illness consisting of: buccal aphthous ulcers, distal arteriopathy, multiform cutaneous lesions (necrotising vasculitis, folliculitis, nodules), hypersensitivity at the site of puncture, Raynaud's syndrome and superficial venous thromboses. After the failure of various therapies (calcium heparin, ticlopidine, colchicine, corticoids, immunostimulants), the patient was successfully treated by normovolemic haemodilution on 20 occasions, obtaining each time healing of the skin lesions within 2 to 4 weeks.
