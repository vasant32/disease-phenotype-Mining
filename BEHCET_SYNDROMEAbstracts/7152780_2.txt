To date, various treatment modalities have failed to produce consistent improvement in patients having Behçet's disease. Recent reports in the literature, however, have shown promising results with the use of colchicine. Our patient, an 18-year-old white woman, satisfied the 1977 Istanbul Conference criteria for Behçet's disease by exhibiting ocular inflammation and a five-year history of severe, recurrent oral and vaginal ulcerations. She was treated with 0.6 mg of colchicine orally twice daily, and at the end of two weeks of treatment, the oral lesions had completely resolved, and the vaginal ulcers were reduced in diameter and depth to at least one half. Within one month all oral and vaginal ulcers were completely healed.
