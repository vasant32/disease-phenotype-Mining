A rare case of pharyngolaryngeal stenosis in Behçet's disease is reported. A 44-year-old female who had Behçet's disease for 13 years complained of dysphagia and dyspnea, and was referred to our hospital for treatment in May 1988. The bilateral meso-hypopharyngeal walls were swollen, and the epiglottis was edematously folded, occluding the larynx. Epiglotectomy and thyrohyoidpexia were performed, with dysphagia and dyspnea disappearing after the operation. Two years after the operation, dysphagia and dyspnea recurred because of two stepped cicatricial stenoses at the mesopharynx. An enlargement operation, incising the pharyngeal cicatricial tissue bilaterally and covering raw surfaces with free skins and the pedunculated cervical flap, was performed. Colchicine, corticosteroid, and tranilast (anti-allergy drug) were administered to prevent re-stenosis. Stenosis was not observed for 10 months after the second operation. Two cases undergone surgical interventions have been reported, and this is the first case reporting long term result of the surgical procedure. Because the skin and mucosa of patients with Behçet's disease shows hyperreactivity to stimuli, the choice of surgical procedure is controversial and recurrence of stenosis is possible.
