A 57-year-old man with Behçet's syndrome and recurrent deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs presented with a painful, pulsating mass on the volar aspect of the radial edge of his left wrist. One month before this visit, he had had venous blood drawn from the same site. Using color Doppler sonography, we diagnosed an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm of the left radial artery, which was then treated with an ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of thrombin. A follow-up examination 6 months after the treatment revealed complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to demonstrate the use of this technique for thrombosis of a pseudoaneurysm in a patient with Behçet's syndrome. We believe that the safety, efficiency, speed, and minimal invasiveness of this procedure make it feasible for use as a treatment for peripheral pseudoaneurysms in such patients.
