Inflammation of retinal blood vessels may be associated with a variety of systemic immune diseases. Despite the fact that a number of immunological abnormalities have been reported in patients with retinal vasculitis (RV), previous studies have failed to demonstrate an immunogenetic predisposition to this disease. HLA A, B, and DR locus typing of 25 patients (14 females) with well-characterized RV revealed an increased incidence of HLA DR4 (corrected p value = 0.04, relative risk = 3.5). The HLA DR4 antigen was increased in patients with both central and peripheral RV as well as in patients with idiopathic disease (14 patients) and in those with Behcet's syndrome (8 patients). The results of this study indicate that immune response genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of RV.
