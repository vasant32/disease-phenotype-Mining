Histopathological features of 53 cases of recurrent oral ulcer (ROU) and 28 cases of Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS) were studied. The findings of light microscopic examinations are as follows: (1) The inflammatory cell reactions in early lesions are characterized by predominant lymphocytes and monocytes which differ from those in later lesions. (2) The vascular lesions are more significant in BS than in ROU. (3) The number of mast cells in the oral lesions of BS is more than that in ROU and controls. (4) Bacteria are observed in 11 specimens stained with HE and multinucleated epithelial giant cells are found in one specimen. It is considered that the lymphomonocytes in epithelial layer may play a role in the destruction of the epithelial cells through autoimmunization.
