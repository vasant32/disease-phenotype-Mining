Major gastrointestinal bleeding is a rare manifestation of intestinal Beh√ßet's disease. We report herein the case of a 64-year-old man with intestinal Beh,et's disease complicated by myelodysplastic syndrome who suffered massive hemorrhage. Colonoscopy demonstrated ulceration of the entire colon from the cecum to the rectum, characterized by punched-out ulcers. Angiography demonstrated apparent extravasation of contrast material in the terminal ileum, and embolization was not successful. Continued and massive bleeding necessitated surgical resection of the involved segment of ileum; however, massive bleeding recurred. Re-endoscopy showed oozing hemorrhage from the multiple colon ulcerations. Intra-arterial prednisolone injection therapy was given, following which the melena gradually subsided and completely stopped within a few days.
