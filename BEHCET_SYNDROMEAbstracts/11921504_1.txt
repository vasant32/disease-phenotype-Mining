Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitis of unknown aetiology. Endothelial cell injury plays an important role in the pathogenesis and immunopathology of systemic vasculitises, but an immunopathogenic basis is also probable in Behçet's disease. E-selectin is an indicator of endothelial injury, and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) is increased in immunological disorders. The serum concentrations of these two markers were determined in 40 patients with active Behçet's disease and 40 healthy controls. E-selectin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and beta 2M was determined by the nephelometric method. The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of E-selectin was 122.13 +/- 62.32 ng/ml and that of beta 2M was 0.31 +/- 0.05 mg/dl. Both concentrations were statistically significantly increased in patients with Behçet's disease compared with controls. More comprehensive studies are needed to determine whether these parameters are useful indicators of the activity of Behçet's disease.
