The diagnosis of Behçet disease is based upon clinical criteria because of the lack of pathognomonic laboratory findings. Recurrent episodes of oral and genital ulcerations, skin lesions, and ocular manifestations are seen. The disease may also involve the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and, less frequently, the large vessels. In general, manifestations occur in the third or fourth decade of life and are not common in children. Therefore few data concerning this age group have been found in the literature. In this study we report a child with Behçet disease beginning at 1 year of age whose cutaneous manifestations were exuberant acne-like and folliculitis-like lesions, which were crucial for diagnostic confirmation.
