In this report we present the 9-year course of disease in a woman of Turkish origin suffering from Behçet's disease with parenchymal CNS involvement combined with myalgia. Differential diagnoses, such as drug-induced neuromyopathy were excluded on the basis of electromyographic and bioptic tests. We were able to arrest progression of symptoms of both the myopathy and the Neuro-Behçet's disease by means of increased combined immunosuppressive therapy.
