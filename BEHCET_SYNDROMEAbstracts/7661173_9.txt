Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, which is characterized by recurrent aphthous ulcers of the mouth and genitalia, uveitis with hypopyon, and a diffuse vasculitis that involves the arterial and venous systems. From January 1968 to July 1993, 66 of 844 patients with BD seen at the Hacettepe University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, experienced a vascular complication other than peripheral thrombophlebitis. The vascular complication in each case was identified based upon a combination of clinical data, digital subtraction angiography, CT, and ultrasonography findings. Six of these 66 (9.1%) had cavernous transformation of the portal vein. Five of these six had additional large vein involvement resulting in the Budd-Chiari syndrome with or without inferior vena caval obstruction. Based upon this experience, it can be concluded that portal vein thrombosis is not a rare complication of BD. When patients with BD are found to have or develop splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis should be suspected and investigated. If hepatomegaly and ascites are detected, Budd-Chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis should be suspected. Finally, if hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and dependent edema of the lower body are present, thrombosis of the inferior vena cava should be suspected.
