The effect of systemic low dose cyclosporin-A (5 mg/kg/day as initial dose) combined with 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg/day prednisolone (when necessary) in clinical course of 22 patients suffering from severe forms of Behçet's disease are reviewed. All the patients had received other drugs previously and had either no response to them or developed intolerable side effects, therefore, pre treatment visual acuity (VA) was compared to post treatment VA as "self control". The average age of our patients was 30.6 years (range 19-51 years). The average duration of our therapy was 19.5 months (range 4-32 months). Improvement or stabilization of vision was achieved in 21 patients (95%). The intraocular inflammation was controlled in all of the eyes and most of the non-ocular signs and symptoms were also improved. Serious side effects included rise in creatinine in 10 (45%) of the patients, rise in bilirubin in 6 (27%) and hypertension in 1 (4.5%). These side effects disappeared as the dose of cyclosporin-A was tapered. We believe this form of therapy is of great value in the management of severe forms of Behçet's disease.
