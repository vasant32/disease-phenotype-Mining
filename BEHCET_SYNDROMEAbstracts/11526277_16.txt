PURPOSE: To assess the application of stent-grafts in the management of aortic and arterial aneurysms in patients with Behçet disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine aneurysms in seven patients were managed with various types of stent-grafts. Diagnoses were based on clinical findings. The aortic aneurysms (n = 3) were thoracic (n = 1), suprarenal (n = 1), or infrarenal (n = 1). The arterial aneurysms (n = 6) were in the right and left subclavian (n = 2), right common carotid (n = 2), right brachiocephalic (n = 1), or left common iliac arteries (n = 1). A tandem connection of Gianturco stent covered with polytetrafluorethylene was placed in three aneurysms, and a balloon-expandable stent was placed in six. RESULTS: The stent-graft was successfully placed in all patients. Immediate follow-up angiography revealed complete exclusion of the aneurysm in all cases. Follow-up computed tomography performed 3 days to 2 weeks later revealed complete exclusion and thrombosis of the aneurysm and patency of the stent-graft in six patients. In one patient, total occlusion of the artery with a stent occurred due to flow disturbance caused by double lesions. During follow-up (range, 6-59 months; mean, 28 months), the aneurysm resolved and completely regressed in four patients. A recurrent aneurysm at the distal margin of previously inserted stent-graft was successfully managed with an additional stent-graft. CONCLUSION: The findings in this initial experience suggest that stent-graft insertion may be a safe and effective alternative to surgical treatment of aortic and arterial aneurysms in patients with Behçet disease.
