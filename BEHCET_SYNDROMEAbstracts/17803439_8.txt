 AIM: The aim of this study was to report our experience on an intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injection for the treatment of unilateral severe panuveitis attacks in patients with Beh√ßet disease (BD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 18 eyes of 15 consecutive patients with BD who received an IVTA injection. RESULTS: The indication for an IVTA injection was severe panuveitis attacks in 15 patients who were unresponsive or intolerant to systemic medications. Intraocular inflammation resolved after a mean period of 25 days following the IVTA injection. During a mean followup period of 28 months (range, 9-50), all eyes showed improvement in visual acuity (mean, 0.71 logMAR units). Twelve (12) eyes (66.6%) had an elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Cataract progression or new cataract formation was detected in 10 eyes (55.5%). Four (4) eyes (22%) had relapses 10-28 months (mean, 19) after the IVTA injection. CONCLUSIONS: The IVTA injection may be used as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of panuveitis attacks in patients with BD who are unresponsive or intolerant to systemic medications. Although it hastens the resolution of attacks and seems to have a long-term, anti-inflammatory effect, relapses can occur in the long term. It is also associated with a high rate of IOP elevation and cataract progression in this group of patients.
