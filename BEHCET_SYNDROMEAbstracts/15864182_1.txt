We report here a case of acute pancreatitis revealing Behcet's disease in an 18-year-old woman. Pancreatitis was due to ischemia secondary to severe abnormalities of the celiac trunk arteries with pseudo-aneurysms. The outcome was favourable after the administration of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. The patient did not experience relapse of pancreatitis 2 years after diagnosis.
