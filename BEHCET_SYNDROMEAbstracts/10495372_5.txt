BACKGROUND: The type and frequency of different manifestations of Beh√ßet's disease (BD) vary in different geographic areas. This variability could affect the ability to diagnose the disease in certain areas by using standardized criteria. The frequency of cutaneous lesions in patients from the United States, where the disease is less prevalent, is not known. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the frequency and type of skin lesions in a series of patients with BD from the United States and to identify methods of confirmation of these lesions as part of the disease process. RESULTS: Cutaneous manifestations were present in 64% of patients with BD. Clinicians most often relied on their clinical diagnosis to identify lesions as part of the spectrum of BD. Skin biopsy specimens were generally nonspecific. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous manifestations were common in patients with BD from the United States and usually were necessary to fulfill the diagnostic criteria of the disease in most cases.
