The intention of the Summary Notes section is to provide the practitioner and trainee with a current, concise reference source to dermatologic diseases and to serve as a form of Continuing Medical Education. Each installment will deal with a specific disease. When included, the pretest questions indicate some of the areas to be covered and will challenge your present knowledge of the material before reading further. The self-assessment post-test questions appear on page 89; the answers are on page 101.
