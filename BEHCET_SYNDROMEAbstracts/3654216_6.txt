Three types of human interferons (IFNs) are differentiated: alpha-interferon (with about 20 subtypes), beta-interferon, and gamma-interferon. In addition to their antiviral properties, these IFN types exert numerous other biological effects, which are increasingly exploited for therapeutic purposes. From 1982 to 1985 long-term recombinant alpha 1-interferon (rIFN-alpha A) was administered systemically in 39 patients with various severe dermatoses. In this study we report our preliminary experiences with systemic administration of rIFN-alpha A in malignant melanoma (MM, 9 patients), in disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS, 8 patients), and in severe Behçet's disease (2 patients). In metastatic MM (clinical stage IV) the result was only moderate; the administration of IFN in earlier stages, for instance as a postoperative adjuvant therapy, appears more promising. In disseminated KS with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) our experience was encouraging. In 7/8 patients the general condition was stabilized and partial remission of skin lesions was observed. In Behçet's disease both patients had good or excellent responses to IFN treatment. The side effects of systemic rIFN-alpha A were moderate, dose-dependent, and tolerable.
