 PURPOSE: To report the conjunctival microvascular abnormalities as the only ocular manifestation of two patients with Behcet's disease. METHOD: Reporting two patients with Behcet's disease presenting conjunctival vascular lesions associated with subconjunctival hemorrhage. RESULTS: The vascular lesions responded rapidly to treatment with topical steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular involvement in Behcet's disease might also occur at unusual sites such as bulbar conjunctiva.
