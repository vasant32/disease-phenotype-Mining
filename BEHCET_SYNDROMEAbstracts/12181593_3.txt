A29-year-old woman with Behçet's disease was admitted to our cardiology department with a history of cough, dyspnea, and palpitation. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a right atrial mass. She was operated on to remove the mass, which was shown by histopathological examination to be a thrombus. Three months later, echocardiography was repeated and recurrent right atrial thrombus was observed. Warfarin was given to the patient. One month later, the mass was not observed on echocardiographic examination. We report recurrent right atrial thrombus in a patient with Behçet's disease.
