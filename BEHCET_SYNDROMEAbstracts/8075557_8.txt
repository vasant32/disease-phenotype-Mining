Behçet's disease is a multisystem disorder characterized by recurrent orogenital ulcerations and uveitis. Vascular involvement can include both arteries and veins, with a preponderance of venous lesions. Aneurysms of splanchnic arteries due to Behçet's disease have been rarely reported. We present an unusual case of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm due to Behçet's disease diagnosed by ultrasonography and angiography.
