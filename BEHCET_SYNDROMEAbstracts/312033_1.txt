Cathepsin B and collagenolytic cathepsin activities were studied biochemically in human aqueous humor. The enzyme activities were found to be significantly high in the aqueous humor of the patients with Behçet's disease, but not detectable in those with senile cataract, retinoblastoma, and maxillar carcinoma. These data suggest that cathepsin B and collagenolytic cathepsin have a certain role in the inflammatory collagenolytic process of Behçet's disease.
