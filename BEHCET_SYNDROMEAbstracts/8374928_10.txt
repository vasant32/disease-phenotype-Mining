Behçet's syndrome is a multisystem disease; however, cardiac involvement in this disorder has been relatively less recognized. Noninvasive imaging methods may reveal a cardiac disorder which has not manifested itself clinically. In this study, radionuclide ventriculography and Doppler echocardiography were performed in 24 patients with Behçet's disease to assess the left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Patients had neither known heart disease nor cardiac symptoms. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed using 99mTc-labeled red blood cells. Ejection fraction (EF), EF fraction in the first 100 ms (EFV), peak ejection rate, time to peak ejection, 1/3 EF, time to end systole, peak filling rate (PFR), time to peak filling and 1/3 filling fraction (1/3 FF) values were computed using Fourier analysis of the time activity curve of the left ventricle with 3 harmonics. Doppler echocardiography (DE) has described impairment of diastolic compliance using analysis of mitral flow. The mean EF (54.7 +/- 9%), EFV (11.6 +/- 3.6%), PFR (2.49 +/- 0.58 EDC/s) and 1/3 FF (33.64 +/- 14%) values were significantly lower in patients than those of the control group. Nine (37.5%) patients demonstrated an impairment of diastolic function and 3 (12.5%) had abnormal systolic function observed by the radionuclide method. DE showed abnormal ventricular compliance in 13.6% of patients. As a conclusion, noninvasive imaging methods such as radionuclide ventriculography and DE may be valuable to detect diastolic impairment as an early sign of cardiac involvement in Behçet's disease.
