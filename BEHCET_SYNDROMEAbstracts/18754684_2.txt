Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease with unclear etiology and pathogenesis. To screen aberrant serum proteins in BD, serum samples were obtained from eight male BD patients with active uveitis and eight male healthy volunteers with informed consent. The serum samples from active BD patients and normal controls were pooled. Highly abundant serum proteins (albumin and IgG) were depleted from these two samples using an affinity capture based kit. The obtained samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Protein spots were visualized with the "blue silver" staining. Differently expressed proteins were subsequently identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption /ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS). Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed using the serum samples from 18 patients with active BD, 6 patients with inactive BD, 22 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, and 20 healthy volunteers to validate the results of 2-DE and MS. Proteomic profiles of the pooled samples were compared, and approximately 800 protein spots were observed in each of the gels. Expression levels of four of the protein spots in active BD were significantly higher than those in the normal controls. Mass spectrometric protein identification revealed that the four protein spots corresponded to two proteins: haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA). Western blot and ELISA showed that Hp was only overexpressed in active BD but not in inactive BD, VKH syndrome, or healthy controls. An obvious band of SAA was detected in 72.2% of the serum samples from BD patients, whereas a vague band of this protein was found in 10.0% of the tested normal samples and 9.1% of VKH samples. Our results revealed a significantly increased expression of Hp and SAA in serum of active BD patients. These two proteins may be involved in the development of BD.
