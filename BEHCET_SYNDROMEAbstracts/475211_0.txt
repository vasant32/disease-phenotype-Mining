The authors studied eight cases of Behcet's disease, all of which were characterized by different degrees of phlebitis disorders. They also reviewed the anatomical and clinical features of a similar type, reported in the published literature. They stress the frequency and severity of changes in the veins in the localization of the various symptomatic lesions of the affection. From these results, they conclude that the primary lesion in this disease could be a phenomenon of vascularity of mainly venous-"tropism" which would explain the proteiform clinical features of Behcet's aphthosis.
