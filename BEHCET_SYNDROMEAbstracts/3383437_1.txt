Phospholipid methylation and phospholipase A2 activation in the membrane of neutrophils and lymphocytes, which participate in the induction of cell activation, were assessed in patients with Behçet's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). [3H-methyl] incorporation and phospholipase A2 activity of neutrophils from active cases of Behçet's disease and RA were significantly increased compared with normal controls. In lymphocytes from the patients with active Behçet's disease and RA, a significant increase in methyltransferase activity and a marked enhancement of phospholipase activity were found. A modest increase in these two membrane phospholipid enzyme activities was observed in lymphocytes of patients with active SLE. In addition, these enzyme activities were significantly enhanced in normal leukocytes preincubated with serum from patients with active SLE and malignant RA. The potentiated functions of neutrophils and lymphocyte abnormalities in the patients tested thus seem to be at least partly due to an increase in these enzymatic activities in the cell membrane.
