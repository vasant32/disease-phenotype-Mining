The Behçet's disease is a vasculitis of an unknown origin. Vascular inflammatory lesions predominantly affect veins, potentially leading to superficial or deep thrombophlebitis. Arterial involvement is rare, mainly aneurysms. We display two case reports of patients where Behçet's disease is revealed by celiac trunk aneurysm. The symptoms are nonspecific. Ultrasound Doppler and angioscan are a key to the diagnosis. The two patients received medical and surgical treatment. By these two case reports, we insist that the diagnosis of Behçet's disease should be evoqued in any young patient with arterial aneurysm.
