 BACKGROUND: No serological marker currently exists to assess disease activity in patients with intestinal Behcet's disease (BD). We conducted this study to determine if the expression level of serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) can be used as a biological marker to assess disease activity in intestinal BD. METHODS: A total of 88 patients with intestinal BD were enrolled prospectively. We assessed their clinical disease activities using the disease activity index for intestinal BD (DAIBD). At the time that the DAIBD was assessed, serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as well as levels of TREM-1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. RESULTS: The mean ESR and mean levels of sTREM-1, CRP, and TNF-α in patients with intestinal BD were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Levels of sTREM-1 were the most highly correlated with disease activity (r = 0.762 for the DAIBD score), followed by CRP levels (r = 0.383 for the DAIBD score) and ESR (r = 0.236 for the DAIBD score). However, serum levels of TNF-α level were not correlated with disease activity (r = -0.017 for the DAIBD score). CONCLUSIONS: Serum sTREM-1 levels were more highly correlated with disease activity than were CRP levels or ESR in patients with intestinal BD, suggesting that serum sTREM-1 level could be a potential marker for the assessment of disease activity of intestinal BD.
