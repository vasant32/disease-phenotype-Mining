Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhages may occur in pulmonary vasculites, including Wegener disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Beh√ßet disease, and other systemic vasculites. The pulmonary bleeding is often the first manifestation of the disease and frequently denotes a severe form. The etiologic diagnosis can be established only by performing a surgical lung biopsy, which is often a difficult decision. Leukoclastic capillaritis of the alveolar septa is the common features shared by all the vasculites responsible for pulmonary hemorrhage.
