A 38-year-old man presented with 2 months' history of a hoarseness and aphthous stomatitis. Image diagnosis showed that he had saccular-type aneurysms of the aortic arch, right subclavian artery, and infrarenal abdominal aorta. Simultaneous total arch replacement, including reconstruction of the right subclavian artery and replacement of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, was performed. Pathologic specimen of each aneurysmal wall revealed that intima and the majority of the medial layer were absent. Chronic inflammatory process was detected in the adventitia that was compatible with diagnosis of Beh√ßet's disease.
