We report a case of Beh√ßet's disease aggravated by gingivitis and carious teeth infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Recurrent severe ulcers in the mouth, and on the genitalia and legs were closely linked with the infection, and dramatically improved after extraction of the carious teeth and administration of systemic vancomycin hydrochloride.
