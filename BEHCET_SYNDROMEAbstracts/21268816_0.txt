 PURPOSE: To investigate the frequency of classified forms in endogenous uveitis in Asahikawa Medical College considering the anatomical location of the inflammation. METHOD: 116 new uveitis patients, who visited our hospital between 2001 and 2008, were retrospectively analyzed. We reviewed medical charts of the patients' age at disease onset, unilateral or bilateral uveitis, anatomical location of inflammation and diagnosis of classified form of uveitis. RESULTS: Age ranged from 5 to 83 years and the distribution of age showed two peaks. Sarcoidosis was the most common form accounting for 33% of all uveitis, 40% of bilateral uveitis and 43% of panuveitis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and Behçet's disease followed sarcoidosis. In the unilateral uveitis cases, herpes virus infectious uveitis was the most common form followed by Behçet's disease and ulcerative colitis. In anterior uveitis, herpes virus infectious uveitis was the most common form followed by sarcoidosis and HLA-B27-positive anterior uveitis. CONCLUSION: The most common form amang the entire endogenous uveitis patient's in our hospital was sarcoidosis, and it was also the commonest in panuveitis and bilateral uveitis. The high frequency of sarcoidosis was remarkable when compared with other studies from other facilities.
