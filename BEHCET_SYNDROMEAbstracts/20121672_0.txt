 BACKGROUND: Reports on arthritis in Behçet disease are relatively scarce, and imaging features vary. PURPOSE: To document the various imaging features of articular disorders of the hand and wrist in Behçet disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four patients, four women aged 26 to 65 years, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Behçet disease, with imaging findings of hand and wrist arthritis, were seen in two institutions. Radiography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were studied to elucidate the pattern and distribution. RESULTS: Both non-erosive arthritis and erosive arthritis of different features were noted: one with non-erosive synovitis of the wrist, one with wrist synovitis with minimal erosion, and two with erosive arthritis of the distal interphalangeal joint. CONCLUSION: Imaging manifestations of arthritis of Behçet disease vary, and may be similar to other seronegative arthritides.
