BACKGROUND: HLA typing was performed in 67 patients with Behçet's disease from Andalucia, Spain to: 1) analyze the association of class I and II molecules with Behçet's disease in Spain; 2) study the clinical correlations and 3) evaluate its diagnostic and/or prognostic role. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1) Serologic typing (microlymphocytotoxicity): class I molecules in 67 patients and class II molecules in 47 patients (controls: 223 healthy volunteers). 2) Oligotyping (PCR-SSO): class II molecules (DQB1 and generic DRB1) in 47 patients and 189 controls. 3) Statistical analysis: chi square test (dicotomic variables) and Student t test (continuous variables), and calculation of the relative risk by the Wolff and Haldane formulas. RESULTS: The HLA B51 antigen was the most frequently observed in the whole series (p = 0.003) in males with ocular disease (p = 0.0001) and in patients with cutaneous (p = 0.001) and digestive involvement (p = 0.05). The HLA B51-positive males were younger at disease onset (p = 0.01) with neurologic involvement being infrequent (p = 0.03). The HLA B51 antigen was associated with neurologic (p = 0.06) and articular involvement (p = 0.05). The DQB1*0303 was associated with uveitis of bad evolution (p = 0.01). The DR11 and DQB1*0301 were more frequent in HLA B51-positive patients and the DQ5 was negatively associated with Behçet's disease, particularly in the HLA B51-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study of the HLA antigens provides useful information for the diagnosis of Behçet's disease, aids in differentiating the different clinical forms and has prognostic significance.
