BACKGROUND: Behçet's disease is an uncommon cause of prolonged fever. This misleading presentation is illustrated by a new case where fever occurred after polyvalent vaccination. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old female patient was seen for prolonged fever after returning from a trip to Africa. She had received polyvalent vaccinations prior to leaving France. At admission fever had persisted for 2 months. The diagnosis of Behçet's disease was finally established on the basis of clinical signs, buccogenital aphtosis and pathergy. Colchicine was partially effective against although low-grade persisted in the evening. DISCUSSION: Clinicians should be aware that Behçet's disease can provoke long-term fever which can sometimes be an inaugural sign. Sensitivity tests may be useful to identify the trigger, for example polyvalent vaccination.
