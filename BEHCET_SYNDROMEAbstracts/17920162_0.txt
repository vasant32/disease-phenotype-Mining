PURPOSE: The aim of our study is to report three cases of retinal venous occlusion in patients with Behçet disease and to discuss the physiopathology of this vascular accident. METHODS: In this retrospective study, out of a series of 32 patients suffering from Behçet disease, we report three cases of retinal venous occlusion. General and ophthalmologic features are described. Treatment strategy is detailed for each case. RESULTS: There were 2 cases of branch retinal venous occlusion and one case of central retinal venous occlusion. Relapses and retinal neovascularization were the most common complications. CONCLUSION: The retinal venous occlusion in Behçet's disease is a non-common but severe complication. Early and appropriate treatment is required to improve the functional prognosis.
