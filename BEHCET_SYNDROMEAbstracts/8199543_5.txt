We performed a retrospective review of double-contrast barium enema examinations of 20 patients with clinically proven Behçet's colitis. Main lesion was ovoid or geographic ulcers with a mean diameter of 2.7 cm. The number of ulcers was single in 15 cases and multiple in five. On six resected specimens, ulcers involved submucosa in three, muscle layer in one, and serosa in two cases with an undermining tendency and transmural inflammation. Aphthous ulcers were present in three cases. Neither perforation nor fistula was demonstrated. In all 20 patients, the ulcer was localized in the ileocecal area, with extension to the ascending colon in seven. Skip lesions were observed in the transverse colon and descending colon in three cases. Destruction of surrounding mucosa resulted in cecal contraction in 19 cases, widening of the ileocecal valve in 19, and fold thickening in the terminal ileum in 12. Six cases (30%) manifested as ileocecal mass accompanied by ulcer, fold thickening, and adjacent mucosal deformity. The appendix was visualized in only three (20%) of the 15 patients with no history of appendectomy. On follow-up study of 15 cases, the ulcers disappeared or decreased in size in 13 cases (86%) and the mucosal deformity was not improved in all cases. On the basis of our results, we believe that the characteristic findings of colitis in Behçet's disease in barium enema examination are ovoid or geographic, relatively large, and deep ulcerations with persistent surrounding deformity which tend to localize in the ileocecal area.
