A case of Behcet syndrome with immunologic evaluation, including screening of a vulvar ulcer for IgG, IgM, IgA, and fibrinogen by direct fluorescent microscopy is presented. Attempts were made to demonstrate cellular and humoral immune responses to mucosal antigens by lymphoblast transformation in the presence of cadaver esophageal mucosal extracts and indirect immunofluorescence using autologous serum and mucosal tissue. Serial measurements of percentages of total T, active T, and B lymphocyte populations, and lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation during the course of Behcet syndrome are also presented. Clinical evaluation, histology of a Behcet vulvar ulcer, and a 2-year followup with good response to chlorambucil are reviewed.
