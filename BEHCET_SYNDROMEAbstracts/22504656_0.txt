The histopathological features of erythema nodosum-like lesions remain controversial with regard to whether they resemble those of conventional erythema nodosum. We reviewed the clinicopathological features of erythema nodosum-like lesions in 26 patients with Behçet's disease and evaluated the clinical characteristics of Behçet's disease in these patients. The results suggest that: (i) the clinico-pathological features of 27% of the erythema nodosum-like lesions in Behçet's disease are indistinguishable from those of conventional erythema nodosum; (ii) the other 73% of the erythema nodosum-like lesions are histopathologically characterized by the presence of vasculitis (venulitis or phlebitis); (iii) the clinical features of erythema nodosum-like lesions with vasculitis show heterogeneity; (iv) the presence of the erythema nodosum type lesion may be an indicator of the mildness of Behçet's disease; and (v) the presence of severe vasculitis, especially phlebitis, in erythema nodosum-like lesions may be an indicator of the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in Behçet's disease.
