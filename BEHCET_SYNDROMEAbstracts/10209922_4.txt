We report a 6-year-old girl with recurrent oral aphthae, genital and perianal ulcers, and folliculitis-like erythema followed by intestinal symptoms. No ocular lesions were found. Her ailment was diagnosed as incomplete Behçet's disease with intestinal involvement. According to the literature, pediatric Behçet's disease is characterized by a low incidence of ocular lesions and a high incidence of intestinal involvement, as exhibited in this case. As intestinal lesions in pediatric Behçet's disease are often life-threatening, a barium enema must be given to exclude the possibility of intestinal involvement when pediatric patients with Behçet's disease complain of abdominal pain.
