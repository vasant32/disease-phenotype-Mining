The authors report a new case of Behcet's disease in association with ankylosing spondylitis. A study of the HLA system in this patient, showed the presence of an HLA 5 (Behcet's disease) and the absence of HLA W 27 (ankylosing spondylitis). The authors recall the frequency of HLA W 27 during ankylosing spondylitis, whether primary or associated with psoriasis, or enteric disease. Desensitisation to autologous saliva proved a failure. A trial of D-Penicillamine produced no beneficial effect on the course of the mucosal ulcers and the inflammatory joints.
