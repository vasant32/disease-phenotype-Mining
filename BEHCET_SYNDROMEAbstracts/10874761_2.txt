INTRODUCTION: Heat shock proteins (HSP) are molecular chaperones which facilitate the biosynthesis and maturation of proteins within cells (protein folding). They promote assembly and disassembly of polypeptides and play a major role in cellular function, not only during the stress response but also at basal state. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: As HSP are immunogenic molecules and can be expressed on cellular membranes, their role in auto-immune and inflammatory diseases, particularly in systemic lupus erythematosus, Beh√ßet's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, has been studied. Cellular immune response of T cells and humoral response with antibodies production against HSP occurring in the course of those diseases have been observed. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Anti-HSP immune response might provide better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in those diseases. At present it is not known whether HSP can trigger them. Indeed, anti-HSP immunity could be induced by the immunological process or be part of a normal immunoregulatory response.
