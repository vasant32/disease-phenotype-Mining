INTRODUCTION: Clinical involvement of the central nervous system occurs in about 10 to 30 percent of patients with Behçet's disease. Neurological pseudo tumoral presentation is rare. CASE REPORT: We report a case of pseudo tumoral neuro-Behçet disease in a 38-year-old man, with past history of facial and dorsal folliculitis, who presented suddenly headache, right hemiplegia, aphasia and disturbed consciousness. Neuroradiological investigations showed a pseudo tumoral lesion in the left capsulo-thalamic region extending to the homolateral peduncle. The patient improved with steroid and immunosuppresseur therapy. CONCLUSION: The clinical and radiological presentation of neuro-Behçet's disease can mimic a brain tumor.
