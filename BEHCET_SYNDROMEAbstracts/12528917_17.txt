PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Behçet's disease above the age of 10 years by means of a population-based study. METHODS: The epidemiological investigation (cross-sectional study) was made between May 1997 and May 1998 at the Park Primary Health Care Center, which is one of the education and research divisions of the Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University. The research aimed to cover all 17,256 (49.2% male, 50.8% female) inhabitants over 10 years of age living in this area. The screening team first surveyed and selected patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis. These patients were further examined, free of charge, in the Preventive Ophthalmology Unit of the Public Health Center, at Ibni Sina Hospital's Behçet Center or in other clinics if necessary. In this study the International Study Group For Behçet's disease Criteria were used. RESULTS: As the final result of the screening, 11 female and 5 male patients with Behçet's disease were found (female/male = 2.2). These patients represented 9 already known and 7 newly diagnosed cases of Behçet's disease. The prevalence of Behçet's disease over 10 years of age is 0.11%. CONCLUSION: The existing regional prevalance studies conducted in Turkey have indicated that the real number of Behçet's patients in our country is markedly higher than the number of registered patients. Therefore the National Behçet's Disease Commity and Surveillance System was founded by our research group in December 1999.
