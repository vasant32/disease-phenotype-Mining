Behçet's disease is characterized by the triad of aphteous stomatitis, genital ulcerations and uveitis. This syndrome is thought to be a systemic disease with various unspecific manifestations, which may arise in other organs as well in a considerable number of cases. More than 50% of all patients do have gastrointestinal symptoms; erosive and ulcerative lesions are found primarily in the jejunum and colon. Case reports are given of 3 patients with Behçet's disease and gastrointestinal involvement; one of these patients died. All patients did have unspecific changes of esophageal motility.
