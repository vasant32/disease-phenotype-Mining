A 50-year-old man with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) diagnosed ten years previously, was submitted to emergency operation of two symptomatic type IV thoracoabdominal aortic and left common iliac aneurysms repair. Despite the rarity of vascular lesions in the course of BD, the uncommon clinical situation of double symptomatic aneurysms was successfully treated with surgical management that appears more difficult because of the inflammatory process associated with obliterative endoarteritis involving all periaortic tissues.
