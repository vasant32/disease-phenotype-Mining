Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory vascular disease with several clinical manifestations and geographical differences in disease expression. In Middle Eastern countries it is one of the most common causes of cerebral venous thrombosis. We report a 29-year-old female admitted for acute headache and vomiting. A magnetic resonance image showed a large thrombosis of sagital and transverse sinuses. She developed oral and genital ulcers a week later. Ophthalmologic examination revealed left anterior uveitis and ipsilateral papilledema. Multiple studies ruled out a hypercoagulability syndrome. The patient used oral contraceptives. Anticoagulant therapy was prescribed. A biopsy of a genital ulcer demonstrated diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with vasculitis. After treatment with topical and systemic corticoids, her condition improved. Venous sinus thrombosis followed by oral and genital ulcers is an unusual presentation of Behçet's disease.
