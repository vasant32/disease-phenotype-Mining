 BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of medical treatments and to identify factors to predict clinical outcome of intestinal Beh√ßet disease (BD) during medical treatment. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of 93 patients who were diagnosed and medically treated with intestinal BD at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea from 1992 to 2007. A therapeutic response was evaluated 8 weeks after the initiation of medical treatment, and cumulative recurrence and surgery rates were also assessed during long-term follow-up. RESULTS: The initial remission rate at 8 weeks after treatment was 66.7%. During the follow-up period, cumulative recurrence rates for intestinal BD were 24.9% at 2 years and 43.0% at 5 years. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with apparent gastrointestinal symptoms at their initial presentation, volcano-type and deep intestinal ulcers, and those who failed to achieve complete remission during the initial treatment. Cumulative rates for surgery were 6.7% at 2 years and 15.1% at 5 years. The typical type of ulcers was the only predictive factor for the likelihood of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that a considerable number of patients experience disease relapse during follow-up despite a high-remission rate after medical treatment for intestinal BD. Careful observation and intensive treatment should be carried out, especially in patients without complete remission after initial treatment, with deep and volcano-shaped ulcers, or with apparent gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of diagnosis.
