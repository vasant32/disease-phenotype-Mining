The differential diagnosis of Beh√ßet's syndrome or Crohn's disease can be extremely difficult. In this case report we present a 32-year old female patient with Crohn's disease. The coexisting extraintestinal symptoms such as mucocutaneous apthous lesions of the mouth and vulva, the erythema nodosa of the lower extremities and recurrent arthralgias made the correct diagnosis even more difficult. The patient was treated with a combination of systemic corticosteroids and azulfidine enema, under which she recovered.
