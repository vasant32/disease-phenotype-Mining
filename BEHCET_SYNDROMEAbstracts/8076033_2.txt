In this report, 14 patients with Behçet's disease with a total of 16 aneurysms are presented. The most common site of aneurysm formation was the femoral artery. Patients with Behçet's disease and aneurysm formation carry the highest morbidity and mortality rates among all those with the disease. The results of reconstructive surgery in the treatment of aneurysms are discouraging, with many anastomotic aneurysms and grafts occluding. In this study, it was possible to ligate major arteries such as the common iliac, superficial femoral and popliteal without limb loss. It is suggested that ligature either at initial surgery or reoperation should be performed to avoid complications of reconstructive surgery. Adjuvant immunotherapy is required to control relapses responsible for new aneurysm formation.
