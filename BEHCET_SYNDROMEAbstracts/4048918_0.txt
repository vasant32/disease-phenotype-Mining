The case is reported of a Swiss woman with neuro-Behçet. She displayed all major findings of this disease, e.g. oral and genital ulcers, chorioretinitis, dermatologic lesions and arthritis, as well as a severe neurological syndrome consisting of conjugated paralysis of the vertical gaze (Parinaud's syndrome) and disorientation. Lumbar puncture confirmed meningoencephalitis. The success of cortisone therapy in the treatment of neuro-Behçet, and the potential of colchicine for prevention of new attacks of the disease, are discussed.
