OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate oral and general health related quality of life (QoL) in patients with Beh√ßet's Disease (BD) and to assess the performance of Turkish versions of oral health related quality questionnaires. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety-four BD patients, 24 patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), 113 healthy controls (HC) and 44 dental patients were investigated. QoL was assessed by oral health impact profile-14 (OHIP-14), oral health related quality of life (OHQoL) and short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires. RESULTS: OHQoL, OHIP-14 and SF-36 subscale scores were significantly worse in patients with BD compared with those in HC (P < 0.05). Both OHIP-14 and OHQoL scores were significantly worse in active patients compared with inactives in BD and RAS (P < 0.05). Scores of SF-36 Role physical, Role emotional and Vitality were also lower in active patients than in inactives in BD (P < 0.05). Scores of OHIP-14 and OHQoL were significantly worse in patients treated with colchicine compared with those treated with immunosuppressives (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both oral and general QoL was impaired in BD and associated with disease activity and treatment modalities. Translated Turkish versions of OHIP-14 and OHQoL were also observed to be valid and reliable questionnaires for further studies.
