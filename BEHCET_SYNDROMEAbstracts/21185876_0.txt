Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disease, leads to early and accelerated atherosclerosis; however, its pathogenesis is not yet fully documented. Salusin-α and β are novel bioactive peptides. Salusin-α suppresses macrophage foam cell formation, while salusin-β stimulates. Moreover, decreased serum salusin-α level has been reported previously in patients with coronary artery disease. The aims of the study were to assess serum salusin-α level and its association with predictors of atherosclerosis in a cohort of patients with RA. The study included 56 RA patients, 37 Behcet's disease (BD) patients, and 29 healthy controls (HC). TNF-α, IL-6 and salusin-α levels, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index and common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were determined. In the RA and BD groups, salusin-α levels (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively) and IMTs (p<0.001 for both) were higher compared to the HC group. However, the level of salusin-α was not directly associated with the IMT in all the groups. Serum salusin-α levels are increased in RA and BD, although they have increased IMT. Salusin-α has been reported to have anti-atherogenic effects in previous studies. However, it seems that salusin-α does not directly affect the atherogenesis in RA and BD. Further studies are needed to understand the regulation of salusin-α and determination of its relations with the predictors of atherosclerosis in RA and BD.
