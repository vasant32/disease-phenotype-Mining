We studied the effects of plasma exchange in nine patients with endogenous uveitis and in one patient with Beh√ßet's syndrome (a total of 15 episodes of uveitis). Topical or systemic drug therapy, which was begun four to 12 weeks before admission, was continued throughout the entire study period of five weeks. Plasma exchange was carried out in four sessions during a one-week period. In each patient a total of 12 liters of plasma was removed and replaced by a 3% human albumin electrolyte solution. Immediately after the plasma exchange period there was a reduction of cellular infiltration of the anterior chamber and vitreous body in all injured eyes. In 21 of 30 instances there was complete remission of inflammatory activity for the control period of 18 months after four plasma exchange sessions. All patients had improved visual acuities. The only side effect was incompatibility reactions to human albumin in two cases.
