A 75-year-old woman presented with intracranial B-cell lymphoma associated with Behcet's disease manifesting as headache and dizziness. She had been treated with prednisolone for 17 years, and colchicine for 4 years under a diagnosis of incomplete Behcet's disease. Computed tomography revealed a 4-cm high density mass surrounded with diffuse edema in the right frontal lobe. Surgery removed a discolored red mass together with hematoma. The histological diagnosis was B-cell type malignant lymphoma. Malignant lymphoma is rarely associated with Behcet's disease, as only 10 cases have been reported.
