Behcet's disease (BD) is a rare multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent ulcers affecting the mouth and genitals, various skin lesions, relapsing iritis, and vasculitis. Vascular events may dominate the clinical presentation in some patients with BD. Hitherto three forms of vascular disease such as venous occlusions, arterial aneurysms, and arterial occlusions have been reported in BD. Renal vascular involvement has reported in less than 1% of the patients with vascular BD. A case of BD with renovascular hypertension is reported. To our knowledge, a case of BD with renovascular hypertension treated with angioplasty and stent implantation has not been reported previously.
