In Behçet's disease, an aneurysm is prone to progress rapidly to a pseudoaneurysm. Acute limb ischemia due to acute thrombosis of a femoral pseudoaneurysm and subsequent Horner's syndrome due to another subclavian pseudoaneurysm are very rare but acceptable complications in Behçet's disease. We present a case of Behçet's disease with multiple pseudoaneurysms, which also showed these other clinical manifestations. Over a short time span, the patient rapidly developed left femoral and right subclavian pseudoaneurysms, which were successfully resected with graft replacements.
