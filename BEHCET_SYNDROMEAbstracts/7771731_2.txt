INTRODUCTION: Pustular vasculitis is a classical manifestation of Behçet's disease. We report a case where the papulopustular eruption formed an arch on the skin and the histology examination showed predominant lymphocytic infiltration. CASE REPORT: A 29 year-old with a past history of recurrent buccal aphthosis had developed episodic papulopustular eruptions over the past 3 years. The diagnostic of Behçet's disease was made on the basis of an association with lymphocytic meningis, uveitis and erythema nodosum. General corticosteroid therapy was effective, but did not prevent skin relapse, controlled with colchicine. DISCUSSION: Pustular vasculitis usually presents with pustular eruptions on purpuric lesions and polynuclear infiltration of the dermis. Predominant lymphocytic infiltration is usually due to a pathergy phenomenon and would be specific for Behçet's disease. In our patient, colchicine was effective, although the mechanism remains to be explained.
