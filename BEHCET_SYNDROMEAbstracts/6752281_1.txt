We have applied computer-linked image analysis to the measurement of polymorphonuclear leucocyte motility under agarose. A high degree of correlation was found between manual and machine values of cell numbers migrating and leading front measurements. This method permits a more complete analysis of cell motility than current methods. It is quick and reliable and allows cell distribution profiles to be studied.
