OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ganciclovir pharmacokinetics and clearance during continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: General intensive care unit of a tertiary care emergency department. PATIENTS: A 63-yr-old female who has a history of active beh√ßet's disease that has been controlled with oral prednisolone, and who has chronic renal failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A 5-mg/kg dosage of ganciclovir was administered intravenously over a 60-min period under continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Samples from the arterial and venous blood catheters and from the ultradiafiltrate were collected over the next 12 hrs to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters and clearance of hemodiafiltration. The pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: half-life of elimination phase 12.6 hrs; total clearance 0.55 mL/min/kg; and volume distribution of steady state 27.07 L. The clearance of hemodiafiltration was 0.63 mL/min/kg. CONCLUSION: Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration is effective in removing ganciclovir from the blood.
