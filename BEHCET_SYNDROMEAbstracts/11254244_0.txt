Beh√ßet's disease (BD), when first described in 1937, consisted of three symptoms: recurrent oral and genital ulcerations and iridocyclitis. Today, it is known that BD is a multisystemic chronic vasculitic disorder which may involve both arteries and veins of all sizes, as well as the central nervous and gastrointestinal systems. The rate of gastrointestinal involvement of BD varies in different populations, being more common in Japan (50%-60%) and less common in the Mediterranean basin, including Turkey (0%-5%). We present a 34-year-old Turkish woman with BD who had ileal and colonic ulcerations complicated by perforation and gastrointestinal bleeding. Special emphasis was placed on the differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease (CD) and BD with gastrointestinal involvement.
