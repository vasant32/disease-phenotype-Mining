Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) secondary to Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a rare condition. The commonest presentation is hemoptysis, which can be fatal. Though the classical triad of recurrent oral and genital ulcers and relapsing iritis is present in most patients of BD, isolated pulmonary artery involvement termed as incomplete BD has been reported. Prompt diagnosis and immunosuppressive therapy can cause regression of aneurysm and prevent fatal hemoptysis. We report a case of PAA due to BD who presented with hemoptysis and responded to steroid therapy.
