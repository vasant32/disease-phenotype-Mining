Brain stem type neuro-Behçet's syndrome was studied with enhanced CT and MRI during the acute and chronic stage of the illness. During the acute stage, brain CT revealed a low density lesion in the brain stem extending from the lower pons up to the midbrain ventrolaterally with marginal enhancement effect. T2-weighted image showed a high signal intensity lesion in the brain stem which mainly involved the basis ponti, tegmentum, tectum and cerebral peduncle. During the chronic stage, the lesion became low in signal intensity with T2-weighted image and reduced in its size without enhancement in brain CT. The prolonged relaxation time of the lesions was gradually normalized with steroid treatment. Sequential brain CT with enhancement and MRI study with T1- and T2-weighted images were useful to detect the lesions and to evaluate the activity in the neuro-Behçet's syndrome.
