 PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and clinical characteristics of Behçet disease in children. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 3382 patients with Behçet disease from October 1986 to December 2005 at Ankara University Medical School Behçet Unit and/or Atmaca private clinic. RESULTS: 110 children were diagnosed with Behçet disease. The 110 children represented 3.3% of the total number of Behçet patients that were reviewed. 62.7% were girls and 37.3% were boys. The mean age at initial manifestation was 11.63 ± 3.46 years and at diagnosis was 14.15 ± 2.13 years. Ocular involvement was found in 30.9% of the children. Of these, 61.8% were bilateral and 38.2% were unilateral. Anterior uveitis was found in 18 eyes (32.8%), posterior uveitis in 24 eyes (43.6%), and panuveitis in 13 eyes (23.6%). CONCLUSION: Behçet disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood uveitis, particularly in endemic areas. The collaboration of pediatricians, rheumatologists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, and other specialists when necessary is required in the diagnosis and management of children with Behçet disease.
