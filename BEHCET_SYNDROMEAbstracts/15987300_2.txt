Vascular thrombosis was found in different proportions of patients with Adamantiades-Beh√ßet's disease (ABD), depending on the ethnicity of the population under study. Various thrombophilic factors, including the levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), were investigated for their role in the thrombotic process with conflicting results. The prevalence of ACA varies considerably in different studies, but their presence has not been associated with increased risk for vascular thrombosis. We present two cases with ABD, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and elevated levels of ACA that fulfil the criteria for both ABD and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
