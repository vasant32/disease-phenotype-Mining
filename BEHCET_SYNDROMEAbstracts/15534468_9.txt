 PURPOSE: To determine the effect of intraoperative application of Mitomycin-C (MMC) with trabeculectomy in uveitic glaucoma associated with Behçet disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six eyes of 26 patients with uveitic glaucoma associated with Behçet disease who underwent trabeculectomy with MMC between 1996 and 2001 were reviewed in this retrospective, noncomparative study. Trabeculectomy + MMC in concentration of 0.4 mg/mL for 3 minutes was performed to all patients. Main outcome measures were control of IOP, the number of antiglaucoma medications required to achieve the desired IOP, visual acuity and complications. The surgical success was defined as IOP less than 22 mm Hg and greater than 5 mm Hg without additional further glaucoma surgery or loss of light perception. RESULTS: The cumulative probability of success was 83.3% at 1 year, 76.2% at 2 years, 70% at 3 years, 66.7% at 4 years and 62.5% at 5 years after surgery. The mean follow-up was 40.0+/-18.0 months. At last follow-up 23% of the patients required no antiglaucoma medications. Best-corrected visual acuity improved or remained within two lines of preoperative visual acuity in 19 eyes (73.1%). Glaucomatous (1 eye 3.8%) and nonglaucomatous optic atrophy (3 eyes 11.5%) was the most frequent reason for visual decrease (total 4 eyes 15.2%). The most common complications were cataract formation in 6 eyes (23.1%), bleb leakage in 4 eyes (15.3%) and choroidal effusion in 3 eyes (11.5%). Phthisis bulbi was found in one (3.8%) patient. CONCLUSION: Trabeculectomy and intraoperative application of MMC appears to provide long term safety and effectiveness in uveitic glaucoma associated with Behçet disease.
