Osteopontin (OPN) and its receptors have been reported to be involved in a number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This study was designed to analyze the OPN serum level in Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and the association of gene polymorphisms of OPN and its receptors with BD. The serum level of OPN in active BD patients, inactive BD patients, and controls was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OPN and 4 SNPs of OPN receptors were genotyped in 318 BD patients and 313 controls using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The OPN level was significantly increased in the serum of active BD patients compared with inactive BD patients and controls. SNP analysis indicated an increased frequency of the OPN rs1126772 A allele in BD patients compared with controls. However, the significance was lost after Bonferroni correction. The prevalence of other SNPs of OPN and its receptors did not differ between BD patients and controls. The results suggest that an increased serum OPN level was associated with clinical severity of BD. There was no association of the tested SNPs of OPN and its receptors with BD in Chinese Han patients.
