 PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important outcome factor in chronic diseases such as Behçet syndrome. We aimed to investigate the relation of HRQOL to the duration of illness, mental state, and visual acuity of patients with Behçet syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional clinical trial of 45 consecutive Behçet patients with ocular involvement. The control group consisted of an age-, sex-, and education-matched group of 45 healthy individuals. All patients and the controls had been given a complete ophthalmic examination. In addition, they completed a questionnaire comprising the SF-36 Health Survey, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Eight multiple regression analyses were carried out in the patient group to determine whether total anxiety scores, total depression scores, duration of the disease, and visual acuity predicted the dependent variable SF-36 subscales. RESULTS: Using the analysis of variance statistical method, comparisons of the patient and the control groups for depression, anxiety, and the subscales of the SF-36 Health Survey indicated a statistical significance for this battery of tests. CONCLUSIONS: Behçet patients with ocular involvement are susceptible to anxiety and depression when compared to age and sex matched controls. It is important for the ophthalmologist to know that changes in the mental state of his patient may trigger a new ocular attack, and to be aware that these changes may play a critical role in the management and preventive measures for Behçet syndrome.
