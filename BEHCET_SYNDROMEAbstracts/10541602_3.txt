Orbital magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated increased signal of the optic nerve in short time inversion recovery (STIR) images of two young women with unilateral visual blurring. In both, recurrent oral and genital ulcerations and papulopustular lesions appeared within the next 14-15 months, respectively, allowing a diagnosis of Behçet's disease. Optic neuropathy may be an early manifestation of Behçt's disease and clinical follow-up is crucial for its diagnosis.
