We present a case report of an aneurysm of the inferior mesenteric artery, associated with occlusion of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and left renal arteries and severe stenosis in the right renal artery, in a 48-year-old patient with Behçet syndrome. The meandering inferior mesenteric artery, with an aneurysm 28 mm in greatest dimension, was the blood supply source for the intraperitoneal viscera. Aneurysm resection and reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery, and right renal artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein was performed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of inferior mesenteric artery aneurysm caused by Behçet syndrome.
