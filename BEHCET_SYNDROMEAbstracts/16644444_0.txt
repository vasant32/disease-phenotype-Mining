Behçet's disease is a systemic inflammatory disease with rare cardiac involvement. We present a case of Behçet's aortitis involving the aortic and mitral valves with vegetations resembling aortic valve endocarditis with subaortic complications. Recurrent aortitis after aortic valve replacement resulted in an aortic pseudoaneurysm formation with moderate perivalvular aortic regurgitation that stabilized with immunosuppressive therapy and without the need for additional cardiac operation.
