 CONTEXT: Behçet's disease (BD) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder with unknown etiology characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers and uveitis. Behçet's disease can affect the central nervous system. AIMS: We aimed to investigate subclinical neurological involvement in patients who were suffering from BD and who had no neurological symptoms. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 49 patients were included in the study. For the investigation of subclinical neurological involvement, the patients received imaging and/or neurophysiologic evaluations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation techniques were as follows: single photon emission computed tomography, 33 patients; cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 25 patients; brainstem auditory evoked potential examination, 36 patients; and electroencephalography (EEG), 30 patients. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum W test were used. RESULTS: Patients in the MRI and EEG groups showed significantly more abnormalities than did age- and gender-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of neurological involvement in BD is important in reducing or preventing complications. Cranial MRI and EEG were found to be useful for detecting subclinical neurological abnormalities in patients with Behçet's disease.
