The discovery of associations between HLA antigens and particular diseases has provided an explanation for some racial differences in the incidence of uveitis. Acute anterior uveitis is strongly associated with HLA B27 and this hereditary influence has been substantiated by evidence of familial cases. HLA B5 occurs more frequently in Japanese patients with Beh√ßet's disease and HLA BW22J and HLA DWa are associated with the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. HLA B7 and HLA DRW2 occur more frequently in patients with presumed ocular histoplasmosis. Some possible explanations for these associations are discussed. Syphilis, cytomegalic inclusion disease, and toxoplasmosis can all produce a congenital form of uveitis.
