A 66-year-old woman with a 30-year history of Behcet's disease was referred for coronary surgery because of restenosed stent and crescendo angina. We succeeded in operating on her by off-pump coronary bypass with bilateral internal mammary arteries, which were anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal artery. The grafts were patent postoperatively and she became free from angina. Coronary surgery for Behcet's disease is extremely rare and this experience prompted us to report this case.
