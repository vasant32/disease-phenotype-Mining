We report a 33-year-old woman who had aseptic meningitis alone, without any other systemic manifestations, due to Behçet's disease. Behçet's disease should be listed as a differential diagnosis of acute aseptic meningitis because, in acute aseptic meningitis caused by Behçet's disease, early treatment with corticosteroids could ameliorate this disorder.
