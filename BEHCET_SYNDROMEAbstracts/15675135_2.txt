OBJECTIVE: To determine the type and frequency of clinical features of Behçet's disease in a population of Italian patients. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 137 Italian patients (76 males and 61 females, age at onset 29.6 +/- 12.2 [mean +/- SD] years) seen consecutively in nine different referral centers. The duration of follow-up at study entry was 10.9 +/- 8.2 years. Virtually all patients fulfilled the classification criteria developed by the International Study Group for Behçet's disease. The clinical manifestations of the patients were recorded by the attending physicians using specifically designed forms. RESULTS: The most frequent manifestations at disease onset were oral (78.3%) and genital aphthae (29.2%) followed by inflammatory ocular involvement (20%) and arthritis (14.2%). The commonest (>50% of cases) manifestations observed throughout the disease course were oral aphthae (99.3%), genital aphthae (62.8%), various cutaneous lesions including erythema nodosum (81.8%), and inflammatory ocular disease (60.6%). Panuveitis and posterior uveitis/retinitis occurred more frequently in males compared with females (28.9% versus 11.5% and 57.9% versus 36.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). 61.6% of our patients were HLA-B51 positive. CONCLUSION: Behçet's disease in Italian patients is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations in agreement with the medical literature. Panuveitis and posterior uveitis/retinitis occur more frequently in male patients.
