A patient presented with fever, haemoptysis and large bilateral perihilar masses. Histology proved that these were pulmonary artery aneurysms due to pulmonary vasculitis, as a manifestation of Beh√ßet's disease. It is suggested that a routine dynamic computed tomographic (CT) scan should be performed in the evaluation of such cases.
