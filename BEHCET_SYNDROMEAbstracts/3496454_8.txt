Plasma von Willebrand factor F VIII related antigen levels were elevated in 13 patients with Behçet's syndrome and vascular disease compared to 17 with Behçet's syndrome without vascular involvement and 23 healthy controls. As expected 12 diseased controls, 9 of whom had systemic sclerosis, had still higher levels of F VIII related antigen.
