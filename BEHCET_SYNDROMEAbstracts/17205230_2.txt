Adamantiades-Behçet disease (ABD) is characterised by oral and genital ulcerations, skin lesions and ocular manifestations and, rarely, by central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Neuro-Behçet disease (NBD) is categorised to parenchymal or non-parenchymal, while combined CNS disease is rarely reported in the literature. A case of NBD, with severe relapsing ocular and neurological disease of combined pattern is presented. Neurological complications included brainstem manifestations, as well as neurovascular involvement, while ocular involvement consisted of bilateral uveitis and branch retinal vein occlusion. Manifestations responded to corticosteroid plus cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. Maintenance therapy included cyclosporine A, azathioprine and corticosteroids. Case individualities are discussed, focusing on scepticism concerning treatment of NBD relapses in the long term.
