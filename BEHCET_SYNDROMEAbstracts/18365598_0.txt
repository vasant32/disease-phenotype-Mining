Behçet's disease is a systemic vasculitis affecting arterioles and venules and is characterized by recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers and ocular inflammation. It can involve any organ but joints, skin, central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract are the most common sites. Here we report an 11-year-old Behçet's disease patient presenting with attacks of myositis accompanied by epididymoorchitis and periodic fever attacks as well as a separate attack of thrombophlebitis.
