A 65-year-old woman with a 48-year history of Behçet's disease associated with nephrotic syndrome is described. Immunofluorescence study revealed IgA nephropathy. Following treatment with an angiotensin II type-I receptor-blocker, an anti-platelet drug, and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, accompanied by dietary restrictions of protein and sodium, proteinuria was markedly decreased. This report describes our experience with a rare entity of Behçet's disease complicated by nephrotic syndrome due to IgA nephropathy. Routine urine examination and renal biopsy are needed for the detection and diagnosis of renal problems with Behçet's disease.
