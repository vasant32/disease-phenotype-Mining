In this study, we examined peripheral insulin resistance in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) characterized by chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Fourteen patients with BD and 15 healthy controls were recruited to the study. Insulin resistance was investigated by the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic glucose clamp technique. BD patients displayed an enhanced rate of insulin resistance compared to healthy controls (P = 0.014). The insulin sensitivity (M), measured as the glucose utilization rate under steady-state conditions of euglycaemia, was significantly decreased (P = 0.001) in BD patients compared to the controls (4.09 +/- 0.16 vs. 5.60 +/- 0.27 mg/kg/min). The C-reactive protein (CRP) level, but not the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), was significantly related to the presence of insulin resistance (CRP: r(s) = 0.589, P = 0.27; ESR: r(s) = 0444, P = 0112), whereas no relationship was found between the M-value and ESR or CRP. We conclude that patients with BD exhibit peripheral insulin resistance; this could be explained as the diverse consequences of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in BD.
