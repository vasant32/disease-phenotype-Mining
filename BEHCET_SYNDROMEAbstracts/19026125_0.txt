OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of polymorphisms of the IL-6 receptor gene (+24013A/G:Ala31Ala; +48892 A/C:Asp358Ala), the IL-8 receptor gene (+2607G/C:Ser/Thr IL-8RA), and TNF-alpha 238 (G/A) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with Behçet's disease in patients of German or Turkish origin. METHODS: DNA was extracted from blood samples taken from patients in Germany (n=93) and Turkey (n=28), as well as from 51 German and 20 Turkish healthy controls. The polymorphisms were analysed by PCR with the LightCycler system. RESULTS: No significant association was found between TNF-alpha 238, +2607 IL-8RA, +48892 IL-6R or +24013 IL-6R- polymorphisms and nationality or disease. Statistically there was no difference between the patients and controls (TNF-alpha 238: p = 0.86; +2607 IL-8RA: p=0.23; +48892 IL-6R: p=0.087; +24013 IL-6R: p = 0.80) nor between Germans and Turks (TNF-alpha 238: p=0.13; +2607 IL-8RA: p=0.68; +48892 IL-6R: p=0.32; +24013 IL-6R: p=0.65). CONCLUSION: The single nucleotide polymorphisms of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptor genes and the TNF-alpha gene analysed here do not appear to be associated with Behçet's disease.
