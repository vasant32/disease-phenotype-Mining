The case of a 14-year-old girl with Behcet syndrome is described. Besides painful and recurrent oral ulcerations, the patient had a cough and intermittent hemoptysis. The initial chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral parahilar opacities. CT and MRI scans of the thorax showed bilateral thrombosing aneurysms of the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary blood flow imaging was performed after technegas ventilation lung scanning and Tc-99m MAA injection using a first-pass radionuclide angiography procedure. Altered blood flow in the left pulmonary artery was shown. Bilateral and well-defined ventilation/perfusion mismatched areas suggested a high probability of pulmonary embolism. Little additional information was obtained on subsequent contrast pulmonary angiography. The high incidence of pulmonary artery hypertension and associated vascular injury risk makes pulmonary angiography an unsafe procedure in patients with pulmonary Behcet syndrome. The need for pulmonary angiography could be obviated in such cases with the use of high-precision MRI and ventilation/perfusion lung scanning, including radionuclide pulmonary angiography.
