OBJECTIVE: Despite unknown etiology, immunologic alterations and neutrophil hyperfunctions may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of Beh√ßet's Disease (BD). The purpose of the study was to investigate whether adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, accepted as a nonspecific marker of T lymphocyte activation, may have a potential role in BD, and also may be related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils. DESIGN AND METHODS: ADA activities and malondialdehyde (MDA; endproduct of lipid peroxidation induced by ROS) levels in both plasma and erythrocytes were spectrophotometrically measured in 25 patients with BD and also in 25 healthy controls. RESULTS: ADA activity was found to be higher in plasma, but lower in erythrocytes; plasma and erythrocyte MDA levels were higher in BD patients than those of controls. In addition, plasma ADA activity was positively related to MDA levels in both plasma (p < 0.05) and erythrocytes (p < 0.01). There was also positive correlation between MDA levels (p < 0.05), but negative correlations between ADA activities (p < 0.01) and also between ADA and MDA values in erythrocytes (p < 0.01) of BD patients. CONCLUSION: These findings may provide some evidence for a potential role of T lymphocyte activation in BD as reflected by increased plasma ADA activity, and for the presence of possible interrelationship between activated T cells and neutrophil hyperfunctions, such as ROS generation, as reflected by increased MDA levels.
