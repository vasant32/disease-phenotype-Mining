The distribution frequency of HLA-A and B antigens was determined in 24 Greek individuals with Adamantiades-Beh√ßet's disease (A-BD) as well as in 280 controls. The standard NIH technique was used for tissue typing. There was an increased incidence of HLA-B5 in the patients group (75% compared to controls 32%). The calculated P corrected value was Pc less than 0.02, the relative risk (RR) was 6.23 and the aetiological fraction (EF) 0.68. This study agrees with the reported association between A-BD and HLA-B5 in other populations from the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East and Far East.
