We present middle and long-term results of cyclophosphamide and procarbazine therapy of Beh√ßet's uveitis. Of 45 patients, 20 were followed for 1-4 years (14 successful cases, 5 satisfactory results with regression of inflammatory signs but no functional improvement, 1 failure), 17 for 5-10 years (9 successes, 5 satisfactory results, 3 failures), and 8 for 11-16 years (2 successes, 2 satisfactory results, 4 failures). The high percentage of success (over 55%) could be attributed partly to the early onset of therapy and may be partly to the choice of drugs.
