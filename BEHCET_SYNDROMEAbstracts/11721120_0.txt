Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disorder characterized by vasculitis. The aim of this report is to present a patient with BD and diverticular disease of the colon and discuss the possible association between BD and diverticulosis. To our knowledge, diverticular disease of the colon has not been previously reported in a patient with BD. We conclude that the significance of this association between BD and diverticulosis needs to be clarified.
