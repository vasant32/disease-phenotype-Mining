Behçet's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of haemoptysis. Pulmonary manifestations of Behçet's disease, which are due to the vasculitis of pulmonary vessels are quite rare. 8 cases who presented with haemoptysis and subsequently diagnosed as Behçet's disease will be presented. The value of diagnostic methods will be discussed. All patients yielded other manifestations of vasculitis such as aphtous stomatitis, genital ulcerations, cutaneous lesions, iridocyclitis and thrombophlebitis. Chest X-ray films yielded unilateral hilar enlargement in 3, unilateral elevation of diaphragm in 3, round and nonhomogenous opacities in 4 of 8 patients. Thorax CAT was performed in 5 of whom 4 showed aneurysms and irregularities of vessel walls. Pulmonary angiography of 2 patients displayed aneurysm and thrombosis. Perfusion defects of various sizes were evident in 7 patients obtained by pulmonary perfusion scans.
