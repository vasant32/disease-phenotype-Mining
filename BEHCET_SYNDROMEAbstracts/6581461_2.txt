Biopsy specimens of 1- to 7-day-old oral ulcers from patients with minor (Mikulicz), herpetiform, and Behcet's aphthae and of nonulcerated oral mucosa of aphthous patients were subjected to a quantitative, stereologic, electron microscopic analysis of the connective tissue infiltrate residing both at the center of and lateral to the ulcers. The data representing volume fractions and the numerical density of cellular and other infiltrate components demonstrated that (1) the infiltrate under the epithelium lateral to the ulcer is different from that at the ulcer's center, (2) at both sites, composition of the gross infiltrate does not change with age of the ulcer, (3) a large population of leukocytes (about 18% in the lateral and 23% in the central region) belong to the monocyte/macrophage series, (4) blast-forming T-lymphocytes are consistently present, blast-forming B-lymphocytes and plasma cells are very rare, and (5) mast cells are several times more numerous than in normal mucosa. In a comparison of the infiltrates of Mikulicz aphthae with those of herpetiform and Behcet's ulcers, it appears that the pathogenesis of the various oral ulcerations may well be diverse.
