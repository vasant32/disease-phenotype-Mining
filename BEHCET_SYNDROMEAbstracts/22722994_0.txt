The aim of this study was to explore whether cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) polymorphisms confer susceptibility to Behcet's disease (BD). A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 C/T, CT60 A/G polymorphisms and BD using; (1) allele contrast, (2) the recessive model, (3) the dominant model, and (4) the additive model. A total of 8 separate comparison studies on BD were considered in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphisms showed no association between BD and the CTLA-4 +49 G allele in all study subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 0.780, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.491-1.240, p = 0.294). Moreover, stratification by ethnicity indicated no association between the CTLA-4 +49 G allele and BD in Turkish population. No association was found between BD and the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphisms using recessive or dominant models or contrast of homozygotes. No association was found between BD and the CTLA-4 -318 C/T or CT60 A/G polymorphisms. This meta-analysis showed that no association was found between CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 C/T or CT60 A/G polymorphisms and BD.
