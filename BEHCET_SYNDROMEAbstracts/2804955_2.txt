Biopsy specimens of recurrent erythema nodosum-like lesions from corticosteroid-treated and non-treated patients with Beh√ßet's syndrome were examined with the electron microscope to determine the incidence of apoptotic cell death of infiltrating lymphocytes in connective tissue. Apoptosis of infiltrating lymphocytes was detected in all corticosteroid-treated patients, but not in non-treated patients. While part of this phenomenon is undoubtedly due to a direct action of corticosteroids on the lymphocytes themselves, it seems likely that indirect action of the corticosteroids such as inhibition of lymphokine or interleukin production may deprive lymphocytes of proliferative and other stimuli and therefore also play some part in the overall response.
