Behcet' s Disease (BD ) is a complex multisystemic disease, which is characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphteous ulcers and iritis in which vasculitis can also be one of the possible clinical manifestations. A thirty seven year-old female patient with incomplete BD was admitted to emergency service, with intra-abdominal hemorrhage more severe than that would be expected, with the degree of related trauma. We decided to manage the patient conservatively, observing vital signs, haemogram, computed tomography (CT) and angiography instead. Subcapsular hematomas were detected in the right and left lobes of the liver. No data was encountered in the literature and textbooks referring to liver trauma with BD, except a case of fatal hemobilia. H ere in we present a liver trauma case with hemorrhage and hepatic fragility due to vasculitis in Behcet' s disease and review the literature. Key words: liver trauma, incomplete Behcet' s disease
