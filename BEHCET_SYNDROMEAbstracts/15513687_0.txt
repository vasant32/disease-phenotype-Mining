Behçet's disease is an idiopathic multi-systemic, inflammatory disorder that may affect major organs, including the central nervous system. It is a clinical diagnosis, and a history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers should be elicited, especially in cases of unexplained uveitis with atypical neurological symptoms. We describe the rapid neurological recovery and neuroimaging changes following high-dose systemic corticosteroids in a 44-year-old man with recurrent oral ulcers, panuveitis, and acute neuro-Behçet's, presenting with meningoencephalitis. Early diagnosis with the aid of appropriate neuroimaging and immunosuppressive therapy prevented long-term neurological complications. Appropriate neuroimaging can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, and provide prognostic information on neuro-Behçet's.
