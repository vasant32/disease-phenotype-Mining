A 21-year-old male of Moroccan descent was admitted for inflammatory polyarthralgia and monoarthritis of the left knee. The patient reported a history of recurrent isolated aphthous ulcerations of the oral cavity. He was found to be positive for the HLA B5 antigen. The other investigations for Behçet's disease were negative. During hospitalization, headache responsible for insomnia developed. Neurologic evaluation was normal, as well as funduscopy and spinal tap findings. CT scan images were suggestive of cerebral thrombophlebitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed an old thrombosis of the right transverse sinus. Time-of-flight MRI (MRI with sequences adapted to the study of vessels) evidenced recent thrombophlebitis of the left transverse sinus. Cerebral angiography fully confirmed MRI findings. Treatment with a corticosteroid and an anticoagulant was successful. Final diagnosis was Behçet's disease. Subsequently, the patient developed additional features of the disease, including hypersensitivity to pinprick, retinal vasculitis, and erythema nodosum. This case is interesting for two reasons: cerebral thrombophlebitis in Behçet's disease can manifest as localized headache. It occurs in 6 to 13% of patients. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential; MRI features of cerebral thrombophlebitis were confirmed by the cerebral angiogram. MRI established that the thrombophlebitis was of recent onset. MRI may be appropriate as the initial investigation in patients with suspected cerebral thrombophlebitis.
