The gastrointestinal manifestation of Behçet's syndrome including colitis and esophageal ulceration has been reported in the past few years. However, esophageal ulceration associated with Behçet's syndrome is a rare condition. There appears to be only seven reports of esophageal ulceration associated with Behçet's syndrome. We have recently observed esophageal ulceration in a 64-year-old male known to be on case of untreated Behçet's syndrome (three major symptoms), who presented with epigastralgia and transient substernal discomfort just after swallowing food. In this patient, endoscopic examination revealed multiple esophageal ulceration and kissing-type gastric ulceration. The esophageal ulcers were not improved by frequent antacid therapy for six weeks, while gastric ulcers responded well to the therapy. Steroid therapy was begun and esophagoscopy revealed scarred ulcers after only two weeks. Therefore, steroid hormone therapy was thought to be of benefit in this patient. Esophageal ulceration associated with Behçet's syndrome, a rare condition, is reported and discussed in accordance with some reviews previously reported.
