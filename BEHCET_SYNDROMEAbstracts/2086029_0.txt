In order to compare the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic criteria of Beh√ßet Syndrome (BS), 98 patients with BS were collected from PUMC Hospital and China-Japan friendship Hospital in Beijing. 105 patients with other connective tissue diseases were taken as controls. Results of the study showed that the sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria of the Zhangs was 100%, O'Duffy's 78.1%, M + B's 71.9%, Japan committees (1987)72.9%, Dilsen's 87.5%, International study group A 81.3% and B 79.2%. The specificity of each of the above-mentioned criteria was 85.9%, 94.3%, 96.2%, 96.2%, 93.3%, 94.3% and 98.1% respectively. The specificity of oral ulceration could be increased to 97% only if it was found together with two other major criteria during the disease course. Ocular symptoms may be 100% specificity if found together with another major criterion. Pathergy test was found positive in 62.2% of the BS patients but rarely seen in control patients and normal subjects. Therefore, it may be considered as a specific test for BS and may well be used as one of the major diagnostic criteria. The authors are of the opinion that BS could be diagnosed only when 3 of the 5 major criteria, i.e. oral ulcer, genital ulcer, erythema nodosum, uveitis/retinitis and positive pathergy test are present, or if two each of the major and minor criteria are found.
