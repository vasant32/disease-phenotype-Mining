Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic, multisystemic, inflammatory process of uncertain origin. Diagnosis criteria consist of recurrent oral ulceration plus two of the following: genital ulceration, ocular and skin lesions, and positive pathergy test. Pulmonary embolism and, especially intracardiac thrombi, are very rare. We report the case of a patient with BD presenting with bilateral pulmonary embolism and intracardiac mass in right atrium.
