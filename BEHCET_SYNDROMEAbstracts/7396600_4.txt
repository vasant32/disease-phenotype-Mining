Behcet's syndrome is a multisystem disease complex, the major manifestions of which are oral and genital ulcers, arthritis, uveitis, and skin eruptions. Less frequently, CNS disturbances, colitis, thrombophlebitis, large-vessel vaculitis, and myocarditis occur. If renal involvement does occur, it is usually manifested by asymptomatic microhematuria and/or proteinuria. Recently, renal amyloidosis and focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with immune complex deposition have been described. We describe a patient with Behcet's syndrome who experienced diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with epithelial cell crescent formation in 75% of glomeruli examined. Immune complexes were not identified. Renal function, impaired on admission, improved with no therapy.
