This study reports the immunohistological detection of serum antibody reacting with the basal aspect of syncytiotrophoblast of human chorionic villi, where SSAV/GaLV (simian sarcoma associated virus/gibbon ape lymphoma virus) type C retrovirus p30 related antigen was observed by an indirect immunofluorescent method using monospecific antibodies against SSAV p28 and GaLV p29. The immunoglobulin class of this antibody activity called 'the anti-basal aspect of syncytiotrophoblast (anti-BAST)', was exclusively IgM and detected in the sera of both female and male patients with SLE and other autoimmune diseases, but rarely in the sera of normal controls. Immunofluorescent absorption and blocking test revealed that anti-BAST specifically reacted with human placenta and cross-reacted with subhuman primate type C RNA retrovirus SSV/SSAV (simian sarcoma virus/simian sarcoma associated virus), but did not cross-react with ATLV (adult T cell leukaemia virus) and BaEV (baboon endogenous retrovirus). These results suggest the presence of a new antigen-antibody system for another human type C retrovirus related antigens(s) and a participation of retrovirus in autoimmune diseases.
