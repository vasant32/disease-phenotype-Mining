 OBJECTIVE: To report on a patient with thalidomide-induced amenorrhea and review the literature on the effect of thalidomide on ovarian function. DESIGN: Case report and literature review. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENT(S): A twenty-eight-year-old woman referred for a 2-year history of amenorrhea. INTERVENTION(S): History, physical examination, laboratory evaluation of the patient, and subsequent medical therapy. Literature review performed by using OVID/Medline and PubMed search strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Diagnosis and appropriate management of thalidomide-induced amenorrhea. RESULT(S): Elevated pituitary gonadotropins, other labs normal. All known causes of hypergonadotropic amenorrhea were excluded. CONCLUSION(S): Thalidomide induces hypergonadotropic amenorrhea. Although this effect appears to be reversible, the long-term effect of thalidomide on ovarian reserve is unclear.
