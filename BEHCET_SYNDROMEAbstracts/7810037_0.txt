The results of comprehensive clinicoimmunologic examinations of 38 uveitis patients with Behçet's disease indicate that uveitis in the presence of Behçet's disease should be referred to multifactorial diseases to whose pathogenesis immunopathologic reactions in various combinations and genetic predisposition contribute much. Generalization of the process in the eye predominated in the clinical picture with involvement of the anterior and posterior segments, retinal vessels, this being combined with general somatic symptoms (aphthae on the buccal mucosa, genitals, arthritides, urethritis/cystitis symptoms, positive 'pricking' test). Study of the immunity status revealed depressed lymphocyte proliferative response to mitogen in 58.8% of patients, hyperimmunoglobulinemia of the A and M classes in 63.3%, impaired complex formation (increased levels of circulating immune complexes in 78.3% and cryoglobulin presence in 57.1%), and various combinations of these immunologic signs. The results indicated patients' infection with herpes virus, streptococcus, toxoplasma. An associative connection of Behçet's disease with A (II) red cell phenotype in 54.8% of patients (p < 0.05) suggests a relationship between genetic factors and the conditions of a specific geographic region. A variety of immunologic changes necessitated the use of corticosteroids, hemoperfusion, cytostatics, and immunity stimulants in the treatment of uveitis in Behçet's disease patients.
