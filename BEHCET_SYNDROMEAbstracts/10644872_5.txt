Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disorder characterized by vasculitis. To our knowledge, 52 patients with BD and amyloidosis have previously been described in the literature. Nephrotic syndrome was the most common type of presentation of amyloidosis in these patients. The prognosis of patients with BD and amyloidosis has not been reported before. In this report, we present a patient with BD and AA-type amyloidosis and analyze the prognosis in these patients. Follow-up and prognosis have been reported in 23 patients. Ten of these 23 patients died and most of these deaths occurred within 3 months after the diagnosis of amyloidosis. End-stage renal disease developed shortly in 4 patients. BD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. In conclusion, the cases with BD and amyloidosis carry poor prognosis.
