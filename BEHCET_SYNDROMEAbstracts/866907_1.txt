Incomplete Reiter's syndrome (ICRS) and incomplete Beh√ßet's disease (ICBD) have many similar clinical features, making the diagnosis difficult. The association of RS and BD with different HL-A antigens is a help in differentiating between the two diseases. Eight patients with incomplete rheumatic syndrome are described. The results of HL-A typing suggest that five patients had incomplete RS and the other three incomplete BD. The value of tissue typing in the correct diagnosis of incomplete rheumatic syndrome is stressed.
