PURPOSE: To report a case of isolated internuclear ophthalmoplegia in a patient with neuro-Behçet's disease. METHOD: We evaluated the patient's clinical course. RESULTS: The patient had isolated internuclear ophthalmoplegia and headache. Subsequent cerebrospinal fluid study revealed marked pleocytosis predominated by lymphocytes (61%) and polymorphonuclear cells (35%), increased protein content, and normal glucose level. A magnetic resonance imaging study with T2-weighted image demonstrated a hyperintense area in the medial longitudinal fasciculus. CONCLUSION: Colchicine treatment of neuro-Behçet's disease caused marked improvement in the symptoms in this case, and the midbrain lesion completely disappeared after treatment.
