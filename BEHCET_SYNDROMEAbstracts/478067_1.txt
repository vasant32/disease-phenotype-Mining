The leucocyte migration inhibition (LIF) was investigated in 16 patients with Beh√ßet's disease, 5 while in the active stage of the process, 3 both during relapse and remission, and 8 during remission of symptoms. In all patients skin tests with various antigens and with a needle prick and physiological saline were simultaneously performed. The results indicate a strong correlation between the activity of the disease, skin reactivity and the reactivity of LIF.
