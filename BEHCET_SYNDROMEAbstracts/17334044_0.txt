 INTRODUCTION: Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology. However, it has been postulated that a dysregulation of the prooxidant/antioxidant balance may be important to its pathogenesis. Ceruloplasmin (CP) is an acute phase protein expressed at the surface of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with antioxidant properties and with a relevant role in iron (Fe) metabolism. OBJECTIVES: To study CP expression at the surface of PBL (PBLCP) in patients with BD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We measured serum CP and PBLCP obtained from BD patients (n=10) and respective controls (n=10) using nephelometry and flow cytometry techniques, respectively. Additionally, haematological parameters, biochemical Fe metabolism markers [serum Fe, serum ferritin, serum transferrin, total Fe binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation] and non-specific markers of inflammation [serum C reactive protein (CRP), beta2-microglobulin] were measured in all individuals. RESULTS: Despite the absence of significant differences between the two study groups when comparing serum CP, a significant difference in PBLCP was found in BD patients mainly due to a significant decrease of CP expression at the surface of CD3-CD56+ lymphocytes. Also, a significant decrease of PBLCP was observed in patients treated with azathioprine compared to patients that were not being treated with this drug. CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, we suggest that the significant decrease of PBLCP observed in BD patients might be due to azathioprine treatment and not directly related to the pathophysiology of BD.
