Behçet's disease patients who visited the eye clinic of Tokyo University Hospital during the past 20 years were surveyed retrospectively, and their epidemiological features and visual prognosis were demonstrated. We evaluated the number of patients, sex ratio, age of onset, ratio of complete type to incomplete type, and ratio of major symptoms other than the ocular manifestation. The results showed a tendency similar to the results of the nationwide hospital survey in Japan. We also evaluated the visual prognosis of Behçet's disease patients in our clinic by the least square method. In the groups of patients whose visual acuity at the initial visit was over 0.4, the visual prognosis of those who visited from 1984 till 1993 was significantly better than that of those who visited from 1974 till 1983. The use of cyclosporine was presumed to be one of the most important factors in the improved visual prognosis of Behçet's disease patients in our clinic.
