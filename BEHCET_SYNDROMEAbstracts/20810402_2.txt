Behcet disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder, rarely found in African Americans. Arterial involvement occurs in less than 8% of patients. Profunda femoral artery aneurysms (PFAAs) are extremely rare and often occur with synchronous aneurysms. We present a case of an African American man diagnosed with Behcet disease from his presentation with PFAA. He was also found to have a synchronous hypogastric artery aneurysm. The patient was immediately treated with corticosteroids and infliximab to control systemic and vascular inflammation, returning 1 month later for surgery. He had a repair of the left PFAA with a common femoral to profunda femoris artery bypass with reversed saphenous vein graft and aneurysmorrhaphy. When a patient presents with an aneurysm in an unusual location, it is important to evaluate for other aneurysms. A careful history and physical examination is also required to see if the aneurysm may be part of an underlying systemic syndrome.
