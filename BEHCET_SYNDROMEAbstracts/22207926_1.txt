 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, diagnosis methods, therapeutic principles of intestinal Behcet's disease. METHODS: king Union Medical College Hospital from August 1998 to April 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical courses of patients with intestinal Behcet's disease were from 26 days to 33 years, and the average duration was 6.32 +/- 1.01 years. The appearance of extra-gastrointestinal symptoms was significantly earlier than that of gastrointestinal symptoms (7.35 +/- 1.39 years vs. 3.24 +/- 0.82 years, P<0.05). The predominant gastrointestinal manifestations were right lower quadrant pain (95.56%) and hematochezia or melena (40.00%). Misdiagnosis occurred in 17 cases. In patients without systemic medicine therapy before surgery, the incidence of postoperative infection of incision site and abdominal cavity was significantly higher than that in those undergoing systemic medicine therapy (80.00% vs. 0%, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the diversity of gastrointestinal manifestations, intestinal Behcet's disease is easily misdiagnosed. The systemic medical therapy before surgery could decrease the incidence of infection of incision and abdominal cavity.
