A case of Behçet's disease with cardiac involvement of aortic and mitral regurgitation is presented. The patient underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement, along with plication of the ascending aorta. Histological examination revealed chronic inflammation with degenerative changes, consistent with Behçet's disease. Anti-inflammatory therapy using prednisolone was maintained throughout the postoperative period. This is the first case of cardio-Behçet's disease surgically treated for both aortic and mitral valves with a successful long-term survival.
