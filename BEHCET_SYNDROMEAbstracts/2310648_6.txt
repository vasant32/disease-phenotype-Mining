A patient is reported with pulmonary arterial occlusions and aneurysms and recurrent haemoptysis. He gave a history of recurrent arthropathy and febrile illnesses; though he had had no other features of Beh√ßet's or Hughes-Stovin syndrome his disease probably fell into this broad diagnostic category.
