The efficacy and safety of oral cyclosporin 10 mg/kg per day in Behçet's disease were compared in a randomised double-masked study with those of colchicine, 1 mg orally per day, and were also investigated in a long-term open study. The double-masked study showed that cyclosporin was effective in treating not only the ocular manifestations of Behçet's disease but also oral aphthous ulcer, dermal lesions, and genital ulceration. Efficacy did not weaken during long-term treatment.
