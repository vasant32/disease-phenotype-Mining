 AIMS: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) has been shown to play a crucial role in the propagation of inflammatory responses. Recent studies have reported that TREM-1 expression is up-regulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we investigated the associations between TREM-1 genetic polymorphisms and IBD development and its phenotypes in the Korean population. MAIN METHODS: Three TREM-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs2234237, rs3789205, and rs9471535) were genotyped by Taqman technology on 202 Crohn's disease (CD), 265 ulcerative colitis (UC), 138 with intestinal Behcet's disease (BD), and 234 healthy controls and the relationships between these SNPs and IBD development and phenotypes were evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: We found that TREM-1 SNPs are significantly associated with the development of intestinal Behcet's disease (rs9471535: odds ratio [OR]=1.637, P=0.025; rs3789205: OR=1.668, P=0.019; rs2234237: OR=1.691, P=0.016), and in particular with skin involvement (rs9471535: OR=2.723, P=0.009; rs3789205: OR=2.477, P=0.017; rs2234237: OR=2.278, P=0.030) and the risk of azathioprine use (rs9471535: OR=2.722, P=0.021; rs3789205: OR=2.493, P=0.032; rs2234237: OR=2.638, P=0.026). However, TREM-1 SNPs were not significantly associated with the development of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of our study suggest that TREM-1 SNPs may play a significant role in the development of intestinal Behcet's disease and may have modest effects on disease severity.
