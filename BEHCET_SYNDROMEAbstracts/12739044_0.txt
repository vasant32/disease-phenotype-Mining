The plasma levels of thrombomodulin in 54 patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and 20 healthy control subjects were studied. The mean thrombomodulin (TM) level was significantly higher in active BD patients than in inactive patients and healthy controls ( P<0.001 and <0.01, respectively). Plasma TM levels did not show a significant relation with clinical manifestations. Increased plasma TM levels are associated with active disease and may reflect the presence of endothelial cell activation and/or injury.
