OBJECTIVE: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were not represented in the diseased controls group that had been utilised in the development of the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for the diagnosis of Beh√ßet's syndrome (BS). Having similar features, both of these conditions can pose problems in the differential diagnosis of BS. Moreover, there has been a recent awareness of coexistence of BS and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The aim of this study was to reassess the performance of ISG criteria among patients with BS and other rheumatological conditions, specifically including those with CD, UC, and FMF. METHODS: 302 consecutive patients with BS and 438 patients with other rheumatological conditions were surveyed for the presence or absence of the features of BS by means of a standard form which had been prepared according to ISG criteria. All control patients with a history of oral ulcer had a pathergy test and an eye examination by an experienced ophthalmologist with a slit lamp. The sensitivity and specificity of the ISG criteria were calculated. RESULTS: Seven of 302 patients with BS (2%) did not fulfill the ISG criteria while 5 of 438 controls (1%) fulfilled the ISG criteria. CONCLUSION: In this study ISG criteria performed well in correctly classifying BS. Further specificity studies might be considered in CD.
