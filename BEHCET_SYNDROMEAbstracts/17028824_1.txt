We report a case of HLA-B52-positive Behçet disease accompanied by multiarterial lesions. A 24-year-old woman was suffering from sporadic high fever and recurrent oral and genital ulcers, and laboratory data revealed severe inflammation. A diagnosis of Behçet disease was made. Magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasound study, and computed tomographic angiography demonstrated multiarterial lesions that had caused no symptoms. These noninvasive examinations were extremely useful in evaluating asymptomatic early vascular lesions.
