Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a CXC chemokine that recruits and activates inflammatory cells, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease (BD). To investigate the association of the genetic polymorphism of IL-8 and BD, we genotyped IL-8 -845 T/C, -738 T/A, -353 A/T, -251 A/T, +293 G/T, +678 T/C and receptors CXCR-1 +2607 G/C and CXCR-2 +785 C/T polymorphisms in 119 Korean patients with BD and 119 age- and sex-matched healthy blood donors. Then, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes were analyzed between patients and controls. There were no SNPs associated with BD. However, the frequency of haplotype TAT inferred from SNPs, IL-8 -353 A/T, -251 A/T and +678 T/C, was significantly higher in patients with BD than controls (5.9 vs 0.0%, P = 0.0001), as was haplotype ATC (6.7 vs 0.0%, P < 0.0001). The haplotype difference was still valid in human leukocyte antigen-B51-negative subjects. In conclusion, we found a significant difference in the distribution of IL-8 gene haplotypes between patients with BD and healthy controls. These results suggest that the genetic polymorphisms of proinflammatory chemokine IL-8 can contribute to the pathogenesis of BD.
