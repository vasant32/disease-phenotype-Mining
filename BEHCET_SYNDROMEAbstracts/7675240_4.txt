We reviewed the clinical course of nine patients with neuro-Beh√ßet's disease to assess difficulties in making this diagnosis. Factors delaying proper diagnosis included lack of accurate history and physical examination, lack of recognition of an underlying systemic syndrome and its relationship to the neurologic symptoms, presence of intermittently normal CSF studies, and use of noncontrasted neuroimaging techniques.
