BACKGROUND: Neurological involvement occurs in 10 to 28% of patients with Behçet's disease. CASE REPORT: We report a case of neurological pseudotumoral presentation of Behçet's in a patient with a long standing disease treated with low dose of prednisone and colchicine (1 mg/day), 2 months after withdrawal of colchicine. CONCLUSION: Neurological manifestations during Behçet disease can be secondary to direct central nervous system involvement (encephalitis, encephalomyelitis) or vascular angitis (essentially cerebral venous thrombosis and, rarely, intracranial aneurysms). Neurological pseudotumoral presentation is rarely reported.
