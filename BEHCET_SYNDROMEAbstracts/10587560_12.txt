OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Behçet's disease (BD), being a systemic vasculitis of unknown aetiology, is associated with hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV). METHODS: In addition to 124 patients [male:female (M/F): 73/51], all fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for BD (1991), 14 patients with systemic necrotizing vasculitis (M/F: 7/7), 47 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (M/F: 36/11) and 51 healthy controls (M/F: 22/29) were also included in this study. Serological markers of four different types of hepatitis (anti-HAV IgM, total anti-HAV, HBsAg, anti-HBs, total anti-HBc, anti-HBc IgM, anti-HCV and anti-HEV) were studied in all cases. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups with respect to HAV, HCV and HEV serologies. Anti-HBs positivity was observed less frequently in BD compared with healthy controls and systemic vasculitis (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Serological evidence of previous HAV, HCV and HEV infections was not significantly different between Behçet's patients and other groups. However, previous HBV infection was found in a significantly lower number of BD patients as compared with healthy controls and systemic vasculitic patients.
