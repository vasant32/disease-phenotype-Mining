Chloroquine and colchicine, widely used in internal medicine practice for a variety of inflammatory diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, and Beh√ßet's disease, may induce neuromuscular complications. Physicians must be familiar with this diagnosis as this iatrogenic neuromuscular pathology may simulate polymyositis, leading thus to inappropriate treatment with prednisone whereas the only effective treatment is to discontinue the drug involved whenever possible. We report three cases of toxic myopathy and/or neuropathy related to chronic chloroquine or colchicine therapy for systemic diseases, and outline the main points to be considered in this situation.
