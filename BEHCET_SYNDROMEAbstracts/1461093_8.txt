To obtain high signal to noise ratio in small volume elements (8 cm3), in vivo 1H NMR spectroscopy of normal and diseased human skeletal muscle was performed using a double spin-echo localization method on a 1.5-T whole body system. High resolved spectra of normal calf muscle show the well known resonances of lipids (methyl, methylene, olefinic, and other fatty acid resonances), creatine/phosphocreatine, choline/carnitine, taurine, and histidine with good intraindividual reproducibility. Pronounced intraindividual differences in the lipid range were found between different upper thigh muscle groups. On pathologic conditions like myopathy, myositis or irradiation damage the spectral lipid content was increased. Three months after local irradiation of the medial vastus muscle (50 Gy), the localized 1H NMR spectrum showed a complete loss of the choline and creatine signals. In a case of M. Beh√ßet with muscular involvement the relative reduction of the choline signal may provide an insight in the pathobiochemistry. The results of our investigations in nine healthy volunteers and three patients are presented in detail including relaxation times of the metabolites.
