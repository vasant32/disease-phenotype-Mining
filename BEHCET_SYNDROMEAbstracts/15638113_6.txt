PURPOSE: To report a patient with Behcet disease presenting with acute optic neuropathy. METHODS: A 47-year-old man was admitted to the authors' clinic owing to sudden visual loss in the left eye. Ophthalmologic and systemic examinations were performed. RESULTS: Visual acuity was 4/10 in the left eye. Fundus examination demonstrated swollen optic disc with blurred margins. There was relative afferent pupil defect in the same eye. Mega-dose corticosteroid treatment was started with the diagnosis of acute optic neuropathy. Ocular findings resolved within 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Beh√ßet disease rarely presents with acute optic neuropathy.
