Cutaneous polyarteritis-nodosa-like lesions are rarely described in Behcet's disease. We report a case of recurrent cutaneous polyarteritis-nodosa-like (C-PAN-like) lesions in Behcet's disease with multiple deep vein thromboses as part of systemic vasculitis. The mucocutaneous manifestations responded to prednisolone; however, C-PAN-like lesions were refractory and responded to oral cyclosporine. We conclude that C-PAN-like lesions may be marker of severe disease and require intense immunosuppressive therapy.
