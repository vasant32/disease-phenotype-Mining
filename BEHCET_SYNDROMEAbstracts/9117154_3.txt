We report on a patient who presented with sustained fever, weight loss, haemoptysis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The diagnosis of Beh√ßet's disease was based on recurrent oral and genital aphthae, pseudofolliculitis and a history of thrombophlebitis. A right intraventricular thrombus and bilateral pulmonary aneurysms were discovered. Their complete recovery was observed within 6 months after a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, colchicine and aspirin therapy was started.
