Previous studies of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, a peculiar drug hypersensitivity reaction, suggested that CXCL8-producing T cells regulate sterile, polymorphonuclear neutrophil-rich skin inflammations. In this study, we test the hypothesis of whether CXCL8-producing T cells are present in autoinflammatory diseases like pustular psoriasis and Behçet's disease. Immunohistochemistry of normal skin revealed few CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, few CXCL8+ cells, and no neutrophilic infiltration, whereas in acute exacerbations of atopic dermatitis, numerous CD4+ T cells but few CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, or CXCL8+ cells were detected. In contrast, a pronounced infiltration of neutrophils and of predominantly CD4+ T cells was observed in skin biopsies from pustular psoriasis, Behçet's disease, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, with infiltrating T cells strongly positive for CXCL8 and the chemokine receptor CCR6. Skin-derived T cell clones from pustular skin reactions were positive for CCR6 but negative for CCR8 and secreted high amounts of CXCL8 and GM-CSF, often together with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha after in vitro stimulation. Moreover, some skin-derived T cell clones from Behçet's disease and from pustular psoriasis predominantly produced CXCL8 and GM-CSF, but failed to secrete IL-5 and IFN-gamma. These cells might represent a particular subset as they differ from both Th1 as well as Th2 T cells and are associated with a unique, neutrophil-rich sterile inflammation. Our findings suggest that CXCL8/GM-CSF-producing T cells may orchestrate neutrophil-rich pathologies of chronic autoinflammatory diseases like pustular psoriasis and Behçet's disease.
