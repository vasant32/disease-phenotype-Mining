A 46-year-old woman was diagnosed with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) at the Department of Dermatology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital in 2000, and was treated with ointment. However, because liver dysfunction developed in 2003, she was referred to our department, where primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) was also diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings. One year later, at the age of 49, she developed manifestations of Beh√ßet's disease (BD), including erythema nodosum in the lower extremities. Because she had a history of uveitis, recurrent oral ulceration was present, and the HLA typing was positive for B51, BD was additionally diagnosed. Liver function normalized within three months of the start of treatment with ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA). This is the first case of PBC associated with BD and PPP.
