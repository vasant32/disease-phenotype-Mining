OBJECTIVE: There are many extra-intestinal findings of Crohn's disease (CD), such as oral and genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, uveitis and arthritis, resembling the manifestations of Beh√ßet's disease (BD). It is also very difficult to distinguish the gastrointestinal involvement of BD from that of CD in some patients. Hence, this study aimed to investigate a possible involvement of the common CD-predisposing CARD15 variants in the genetic susceptibility to BD. METHODS: The study group consisted of 85 consecutive patients with BD (51 male, 34 female) of Turkish origin. Two of them had intestinal involvement. A group of 100 ethnically matched, non-related healthy volunteers were used as controls. All individuals were genotyped for 3 common CARD15 variants (R702W, G908R, and Ll007fsinsC) using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: None of the three CARD15 variants predisposing to CD was observed in patients with BD, including two patients with intestinal involvement. The R702W mutation was observed in I healthy chromosome, and the 3020insC mutation in 2 chromosomes. No individual was found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for these variants. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 3 most common CD-predisposing CARD15 variants do not constitute a genetic susceptibility factor for BD in Turkey. Further studies would be helpful to rule out a possible contribution of other rare or unknown variants and/or the effects of different ethnic backgrounds.
