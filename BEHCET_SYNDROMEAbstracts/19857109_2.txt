 PURPOSE: To report a case of a successful cataract surgery outcome in a patient with Beh√ßet's disease (BD) without postoperative inflammation under infliximab therapy. CASE: A 40-year-old man who had frequent episodes of hypopyon uveitis despite immunosuppressive therapy underwent cataract surgery. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) was given intravenously to prevent inflammation during the perioperative period. After the initial administration, infliximab was given at 2 and 6 weeks, and then it was given at 8 weeks intervals thereafter. The patient underwent cataract surgery in both eyes at the midpoint of the 8 weeks duration schedule with an uneventful postoperative clinical course for up to 12 months except for the contraction of the anterior capsule in both eyes and posterior capsule opacification in 1 eye. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy may be effective when performing cataract surgery on BD patients who have uncontrollable uveitis.
