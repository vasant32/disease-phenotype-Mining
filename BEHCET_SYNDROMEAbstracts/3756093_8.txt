No relapses of symptoms in a patient with neuro-Behçet's syndrome were observed after the addition of thalidomide to chlorambucil and prednisolone therapy. At present, the patient has been free of symptoms for 3 years. This observation, together with those reported from the literature, strongly support a re-evaluation of thalidomide therapy in certain life-threatening diseases such as neuro-Behçet's syndrome.
