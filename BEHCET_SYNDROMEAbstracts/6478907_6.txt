Cardio-Behcet's disease is not often reported; only one case to our knowledge has described complete atrioventricular (AV) block, without pathologic details. We document, from direct observation during surgery and pathologic examination of associated lesions, a case whose conduction disturbance was possibly caused by direct extension of Behcet's disease itself into the conduction system.
