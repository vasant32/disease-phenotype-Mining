 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study was designed to identify susceptibility to insulin resistance and the association of serum resistin and adiponectin with insulin resistance in patients with Beh√ßet's disease (BD). Also, we identify risk determinants for insulin resistance in BD patients. METHODS: The study population consisted of 82 BD patients (n = 26 males) and 89 healthy controls (n = 40 males). Clinical data were collected at the time of enrollment, and serum resistin and adiponectin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated by measuring fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels. RESULTS: BD patients and healthy controls differed significantly in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (1.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.5, p<0.001) and serum resistin level (7901.7 +/- 1314.9 vs. 7444.2 +/- 1841.6, p = 0.001) but not in serum adiponectin level (p = 0.223). No differences in HOMA-IR, serum adiponectin, and serum resistin were found between patients with active and inactive BD. It is determined that plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and serum resistin may be determinant for the HOMA-IR. The number of metabolic syndrome components is closely correlated with HOMA-IR in BD patients (r = 0.245, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there is an increased susceptibility to insulin resistance in patients with BD as compared to healthy controls. Serum resistin level may be an independent determinant for insulin resistance in BD patients.
