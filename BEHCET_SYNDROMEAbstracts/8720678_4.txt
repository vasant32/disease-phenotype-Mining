BACKGROUND: The vaso-occlusive episodes resulting from Behçet's disease can cause capillary dropout and vascular remodeling. Retinal and disc neovascularizations, which occur as a result of occlusive vasculitis, can cause recurrent vitreal hemorrhages and neovascular glaucoma leading to severe visual impairment. METHODS: 1080 eyes of 540 patients with Behçet's disease were examined between 1973 and 1993. Of the 912 eyes with posterior segment involvement, laser photocoagulation could be performed in 13 of 25 eyes with disc neovascularization (NVD), 12 of 22 eyes with retinal neovascularization (NVE), and 4 of 6 eyes with NVD and NVE. Laser was directed at areas of NVE and retinal capillary nonperfusion. In cases of NVD, panretinal photocoagulation was performed. RESULTS: The rate of regression of NVD was significantly greater in laser-treated eyes than in the untreated group. The results were similar in cases of NVD with NVE. In eyes with NVE which underwent laser photocoagulation, the NVE regressed. None of the treated eyes developed neovascular glaucoma during the follow-up period. Vitreous hemorrhage occurred in two laser-treated eyes. CONCLUSION: Laser photocoagulation is successful in preventing complications of retinal and disc neovascularizations. Thus, in cases of occlusive vasculitis associated with Behçet's disease, laser photocoagulation should be considered for prevention of complications such as vitreous hemorrhage and neovascular glaucoma.
