Vascular lesions in Behçet's disease are generally localized in the venous system: up to 24% of the cases reported in the literature are accompanied by thrombosis/thrombophlebitis. Reports of arterial involvement are rare but have increased during the last decade. Surgical treatments of arterial aneurysms and occlusions are often followed by recurrences due to progression or relapses of the inflammatory vessel wall lesions. Aneurysms of the pulmonary artery are rare. They may be complicated by thrombosis within the aneurysm and massive hemoptysis due to bronchial erosion and formation of an arterio-bronchial fistula. 27 cases of Behçet's disease are reported.
