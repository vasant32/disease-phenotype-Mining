Behçet's disease is 1 of the most common causes of uveitis in the Eastern world. Its common ocular complications are uveitis, cataract, and obliteration of retinal vessels. Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in patients with Behçet's disease is known to be a safe procedure. We managed a patient with Behçet's disease who had aggravated uveitis and opacification of a hydrophilic acrylic IOL (ACRL-C160, Ophthalmed) 4 months after cataract surgery. Recalcitrant uveitis despite maximum tolerable medication and IOL opacification with vitreous opacity necessitated an IOL exchange and trans pars plana vitrectomy. After the procedure, the eye became quiescent. However, the visual acuity was 20/200 because of the obliteration of retinal vessels.
