Beh√ßet's syndrome is a very uncommon, chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder that may affect the gastrointestinal tract. Esophageal involvement is rare, and to my knowledge, secondary stenosis of the pharynx has not been previously reported as a complication. A case is described in which dysphagia caused by pharyngeal stenosis was a presenting feature in this condition and obstructive airway symptoms subsequently developed.
