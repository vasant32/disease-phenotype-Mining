The authors report a case of superior vena cava thrombosis associated to a chylothorax during Behcet's disease. This thrombosis was revealed during an evolutive phase by dyspnea and a superior vena cava syndrome. Its course was favourable under a medical treatment associating: pleural drainage, parenteral feeding, corticotherapy and heparin therapy. Then the authors review the bibliography and recall the frequency, pathogenesis, clinic and treatment of this unusual complication of the Touraine's aphthosis. Such a complication appears paradoxically to present a favourable course.
