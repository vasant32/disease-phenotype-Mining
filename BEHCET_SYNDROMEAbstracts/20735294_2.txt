 PURPOSE: To analyze clinical patterns, causes, and systemic disease associations among patients with uveitis admitted to King Abdulaziz University Hospital. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 351 patients (600 eyes). RESULTS: The study subjects consisted of 183 (52.1%) males and 168 (47.9%) females, with a mean age of 39.9 ± 14.2 years at presentation. The most common anatomic diagnosis was panuveitis (68.6%), followed by posterior uveitis (12.7%), anterior uveitis (12.7%), and intermediate uveitis (6.0%). The most common identifiable specific diagnoses were presumed tuberculous uveitis (PTU) (28.2%), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (19.4%), Behçet disease (BD) (12.5%), and toxoplasmosis (8.2%). After a mean follow-up period of 29.5 ± 22.1 months, 63.5% of the eyes achieved visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Eyes from patients with PTU had the worst final visual outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The most common anatomic diagnosis was panuveitis. PTU, VKH disease, BD, and toxoplasmosis were the most frequent specific diagnoses.
