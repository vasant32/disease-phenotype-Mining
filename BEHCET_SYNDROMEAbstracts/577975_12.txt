Six patients with Behçet's syndrome were treated with transfer factor (TF) from randomly selected donors. Mucocutaneous symptoms and signs were predominant at the time that TF injections were started. Three patients showed great improvement, one moderate improvement, and one was unresponsive to multiple injections of TF from different donors. One case was uninterpretable because of concomitant administration of high doses of prednisone and chlorambucil and brief treatment with TF. These results indicate that TF therapy may be beneficial in some patients with Behçet's syndrome and that a trial of TF is warranted at least in the absence of severe ocular or neurologic manifestations.
