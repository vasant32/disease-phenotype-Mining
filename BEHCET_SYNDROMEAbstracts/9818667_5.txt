OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the frequency of fibromyalgia (FM) in Behçet's syndrome (BS) and to evaluate the relationship of FM to Behçet's disease activity. METHOD: Self-questionnaires were completed by 108 patients with BS. Each patient was evaluated by an observer blinded to diagnosis; evaluation included assessment of tender points by palpation. Another observer determined the disease activity of patients at that time. RESULTS: Ten of 108 patients (9.2%) met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM. Nine of the patients who met the criteria for FM were women. In contrast to patients without FM, patients with FM had mild to moderate disease activity in which musculoskeletal complaints were common. CONCLUSION: There is a trend for an increased frequency of FM in female BS patients.
