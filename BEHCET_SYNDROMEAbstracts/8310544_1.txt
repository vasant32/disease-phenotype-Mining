The authors report a retrospective study of 50 CT Scan made for patients suffering from Behçet's disease with neurological manifestations. Neuro-Behçet can affect all the central nervous system structures with particular predilection to the brain stem, internal capsula and basal brain ganglia. The authors emphasize on the importance of CT Scan for the diagnosis, the severity evaluation of the neurological impairment and for the Neuro-Behcet's prognosis.
