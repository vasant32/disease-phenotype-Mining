HLA B51 specificity is strongly associated with Behcet's disease (BD) (for references see Baricordi et al., 1986), a multisystem vasculitis of unknown aetiology, for which an immunological pathogenesis has been proposed (O'Duffy et al., 1983; O'Duffy et al., 1990). Neutrophil abnormalities observed in BD patients even during clinical remission suggest prominent involvement of these phagocytic cells in the pathogenesis of the disease (Niwa et al., 1982). In order to clarify how HLA B51 antigen might confer susceptibility to BD, we have investigated neutrophil function in 13 B51-positive and 13 B51-negative healthy subjects. Lymphocyte spontaneous proliferation and circulating immune complexes were also evaluated. Whereas neutrophils from B51-positive subjects showed an increase in the chemotactic response toward casein (P = 0.003) and LPS (P = 0.033) and also in the PMA-induced superoxide production (P = 0.008) no evidence of enhanced lymphocyte activation emerged. These results suggest that the HLA region can exert a regulatory control on PMN functions.
