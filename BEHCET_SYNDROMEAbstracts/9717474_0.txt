A 25-year-old Hispanic woman presented with painful oral ulcers, a sore throat, and dysphagia of two weeks' duration. She was treated empirically with acyclovir for presumed herpes simplex stomatitis and esophagitis and sent home. A week later, she returned with complaints of worsening sore throat, fever (as high as 38.9 degrees C), and cough producing yellow-green sputum. She had not had chills, shortness of breath, burning on urination, or a change in bowel habits.
