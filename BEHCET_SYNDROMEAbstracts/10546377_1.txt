The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 201 patients with intermediate, posterior or panuveitis to determine the most frequent etiologies and collect some epidemiological data. A specific diagnosis was made in 70% of the cases: 35% were of infectious origin, 23% were associated with a systemic disease and 24% had a specific ocular condition. The most common entities included toxoplasmosis (24%), sarcoidosis (7.5%) and Beh√ßet disease (5.5%). Birdshot retinochoroidopathy was the most frequent specific ocular disease (3.5%). The findings of this study are compared with those previously published in the literature.
