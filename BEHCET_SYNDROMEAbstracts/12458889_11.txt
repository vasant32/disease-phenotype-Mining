The aims of this study were to assess whether the increased oxidative stress in affected tissues is reflected by serum lipid peroxidation and to check for alterations in serum levels of extracellular antioxidants and antioxidant enzyme activities in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) levels and CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were increased, while serum transferrin (Trf) levels were diminished in patients with active ocular BD (n = 19), inactive ocular BD (n=18), and nonocular BD (n=15), compared to healthy controls (n = 20). Serum MDA levels in patients with active ocular BD and nonocular BD were significantly higher than in the inactive ocular BD group. Patients with active ocular BD also had significantly higher serum Cu-Zn SOD activities, compared to the inactive ocular BD. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were higher in patients with active ocular BD, inactive ocular BD, and nonocular BD, compared to the control group. In addition, patients with active ocular BD and nonocular BD had significantly higher ESR and serum CRP levels, compared to the inactive ocular BD group. Serum albumin concentrations showed no significant differences among the BD patients and controls. The authors speculate that in BD patients, serum superoxide radicals may be dismutated to H2O2 by increased CuZn-SOD activity and the conversion of H2O2 to hydroxyl radical may be enhanced by iron, owing to diminished serum Trf; these mechanisms may contribute to the increased serum lipid peroxidation.
