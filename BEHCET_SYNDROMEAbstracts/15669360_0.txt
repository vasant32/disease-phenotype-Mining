Pulmonary involvement in Behcet's disease is uncommon and pulmonary arterial aneurysms are present in about 1 to 7% of patients. But despite their scarcity, they represent a life-threatening complication and are usually regarded as of a poor prognosis. Our study aims to describe the epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of this condition. Among 180 patients with Behcet's disease according to the criteria of the international study group for Behcet's disease, four were diagnosed as having pulmonary artery aneurysms (2.22%). All were male, the mean age at the time of the diagnosis of pulmonary artery aneurysms was 29.8 years and the mean disease duration was 6.6 years. Hemoptysis was the presenting symptom in all cases. The patients were treated by corticosteroid, colchicine and cyclophosphamide pulses. The outcome was good with disappearance of hemoptysis in all cases and disappearance of pulmonary aneurysms in three. One patient had recurrence of aneurysms 40 months after the first episode and died 18 months later. So, we can hope, thanks to medical treatment, a better outcome than previously reported in this complication.
