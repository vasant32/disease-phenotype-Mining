Pseudotumoral presentation of Neuro-Beh√ßet's disease has been described before. The diagnosis may be difficult obtain in patients without mucosal, cutaneous, and ocular signs. We report the observation of a young patient suffering from a right hemiparesis with computed-tomographic (CT) features suggestive of a thalamocapsular expanding lesion. Histologic study of brain biopsy tissue ruled out a tumor but did not show any specific diagnosis. The patient improved with steroid therapy.
