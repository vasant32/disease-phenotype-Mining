It was believed that there were no abnormal radiographic changes in patients with Behcet's disease, but in this study, we examined X-ray films of the hands of 20 patients with Behcet's disease who had had a history of arthritis in the hands for more than 5 years. As a result, juxta-articular demineralization was seen in 11 patients, carpal rotation was seen in 9, narrowing of the joint space was observed in 3, and asymmetrical bone destruction was seen in 2. From our study, radiological abnormalities of the joints appear more common in Behcet's disease than believed.
