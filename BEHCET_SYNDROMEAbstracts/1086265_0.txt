Lymphangiectasia of the small intestine was demonstrated in 9 to 18 cases with protein losing gastroenteropathy and in 10 of 26 cases with Behçhet's disease. Protein losing gastroenteropathy was compared to Behçet's disease in view of immunological aspects. Immunoglobulin containing cells in the jejunal mucosa of protein losing gastroenteropathy were decreased, whereas Behçet's disease had normal or increased distribution. This suggested that suggested that immunoglobulin may be lost into the intestinal lumen or that production of those cells may be inhibited in protein losing gastroenteropathy. Decreased DNCB skin reaction and impaired blastoid transformation of peripheral lymphocytes in both of two diseases suggested that there should be immunological defect in those diseases. However, in Behçet's disease, investigation of the thymus disclosed hyperplasia and the presence of lymphoid follicle which does not appear in normal state. In conclusion, protein losing gastroenteropathy is in immunological deficiency state due to the congenital or acquired disorders of lymphatics which implies abnormal protein loss, decreased immunoglobulin containing cells in the jejunal mucosa and decreased sensitivity. On the contrary, in Behçet's disease hyperimmune state is present based on thymic hyperplasia.
