This study reports 4 cases of Behçet Syndrome which came under our observation and were surgically treated for vascular or gastrointestinal manifestations. These cases included 3 males and 1 female, mean age 26.5 years, of which 2 were treated with implantation of prosthesis for aneurysm of the abdominal aorta with recurrence of Behçet vasculitis and prosthesis substitution three years later in one case, 1 with total colectomy for ulcerous rectocolitis, while the last case (female) required excision and plastic reconstruction, for a perforated duodenal ulcer. Immediate and long-term results of the surgical treatment of the gastrointestinal and vascular manifestations and/or complications were satisfactory, whereas the long-term results of the medical treatment of the basic disease were unsuccessful in 50% of cases. BS is a rare affliction, whose pathogenesis is still poorly defined and in which the results of medical treatment cannot be regarded as satisfactory to date. Surgical treatment of its vascular and gastrointestinal manifestations and complications, on the other hand, was effective in our experience.
