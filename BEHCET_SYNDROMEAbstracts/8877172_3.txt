Behçet's disease is an idiopathic, recurrent multisystem syndrome characterized by oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and ocular inflammation. Small bowel involvement may occur in 1% of patients with aphthous ulceration which may mimic Crohn's disease. We report a case of a patient with Behçet's disease with small bowel pathology which simulated a mass and at surgery was an inflammatory pseudotumor. Inflammatory pseudotumors can be mistaken for a malignancy as was the case in this patient.
