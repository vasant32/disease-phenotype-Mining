 PURPOSE: To determine whether repeated intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) injections in patients with Behçet disease that is resistant to conventional therapy will prevent recurrences of uveitis. DESIGN: Prospective preliminary clinical trial. METHODS: Nine eyes of five patients with Behçet disease with sight-threatening uveitis that was resistant to conventional therapy received repeated IVTA injections. Each patient was examined monthly, and IVTA was given when the TA particles that remained in the vitreous were judged to be gone before the next visit. RESULTS: Repeated IVTA completely prevented the recurrence of uveitis in eight eyes, and the one eye that had an attack experienced the uveitis when the TA particles disappeared quicker than expected. It was possible to stop systemic corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive agents within 1 year after IVTA in three patients. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that repeated IVTA will prevent the recurrence of uveitis in patients with Behçet disease with frequent ocular attacks that is resistant to conventional therapy.
