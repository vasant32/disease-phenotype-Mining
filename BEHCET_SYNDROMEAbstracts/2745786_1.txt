A woman with neuro-Behçet disease characterized by recurrent attacks of meningoencephalitis is reported. During an attack of brain stem dysfunction characterized by dysarthria, diplopia, and ataxia, the postcontrast CT showed an enhancing lesion of the upper brain stem. During a subsequent attack characterized by subcortical dementia and amnesia, magnetic resonance (MR) showed abnormal signal intensity in the hypothalamus and upper brain stem. Upon remission of her symptoms, follow-up contrast enhanced CT and MR were entirely normal. Magnetic resonance is especially useful in localizing acute inflammatory lesions in Behçet disease. This case suggests that abnormal MR and CT findings in neuro-Behçet disease are potentially reversible and that radiographic improvement parallels clinical improvement.
