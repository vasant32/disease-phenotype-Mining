PURPOSE: To report a case of central retinal artery occlusion associated with ocular Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and briefly discuss retinal vasculitis due to BD. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old man, diagnosed as BD 22 years ago and followed up with ocular involvement for six years presented with sudden loss of vision. The clinical diagnosis was central retinal artery occlusion. RESULTS: No other associated systemic diseases were found and the case was classified as a complication of retinal vasculitis due to BD. CONCLUSIONS: Although the arteries are rarely affected in retinal vasculitis due to BD, it has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of retinal arterial occlusions especially in countries where the disease is prevalent. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ocular BD complicated with central retinal artery occlusion.
