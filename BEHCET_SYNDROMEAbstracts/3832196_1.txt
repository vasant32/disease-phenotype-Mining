Five case histories of intra-thoracic involvement occurring in the course of Behcet's disease were studied. These included a superior vena caval obstruction, an obstructive syndrome, transitory infiltrates, repeated lung infections and a case of haemoptysis. A review of the literature was carried out "Ã  propos" of each case. The blood results seemed to be the involved as a manifestation of all the varied clinical presentations. The advantage of specialised investigations such as pulmonary angiography, perfusion scintigraphy and bronchial arteriography is underlined.
