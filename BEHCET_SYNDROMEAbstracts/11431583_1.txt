OBJECTIVE: To assess prolactin level and its possible role in the pathogenesis and disease expression of patients with Behçet's disease (BD). Materials and methods: Twenty-eight patients with the diagnosis of Behçet's disease were selected. They all fulfilled the international criteria for BD. The control group consisted of 17 males and 6 females. Patients are divided into subgroups according to the clinical and paraclinical characteristics such as disease duration, ocular, articular and neurological involvement. Serum prolactin was measured by ELISA using Merck Kits on a Maggia 7000 Analyser. The normal range in males was<17ng/ml in males and<18ng/ml in females. The mean PRL level in each group and subgroup was calculated and compared with Student's t test. RESULTS: The mean prolactin level in the BD group (mean=13.76, SD=6.82), was higher than in the control group (mean=10.13, SD=5.46) with no statistically significant difference. The mean prolactin levels in all subgroups of patients with BD were higher than normal, but no statistically significant difference was shown between these subgroups. CONCLUSION: Hyperprolactinemia occurred in a small number of patients with BD and its significance remained unclear. Serum PRL level did not correlate with disease manifestations and activity.
