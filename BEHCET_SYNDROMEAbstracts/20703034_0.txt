Macular edema (ME) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) can complicate the course of several inflammatory chorioretinal diseases, leading to a severe visual function impairment. The most frequently involved clinical entities include for example multifocal choroiditis, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, Be√ßhet's disease, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, birdshot chorioretinopathy, acute multifocal posterior placoid pigment epitheliopathy, serpiginous choroiditis, and persistent placoid maculopathy. Results that have reported on antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment in uveitic patients with CNV or ME have demonstrated positive results in many cases. However, bearing in mind that it has been proven impossible to perform randomized clinical trials with anti-VEGF in uveitic patients with CNV or ME, further studies with longer follow-ups are necessary to assess the value of this therapeutic approach.
