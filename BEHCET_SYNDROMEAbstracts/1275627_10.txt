A 46-year-old man with Behçet syndrome and a long history of recurrent bouts of colitis was studied by sigmoidoscopy, barium enema x-ray film, and colon biopsy. A nonspecific colitis characterized by shallow mucosal ulcerations and submucosal mononuclear infiltration in the absence of meaningful roentgenolographic changes was seen. A histopathological comparison was made between the oral and colonic lesions. The aphthous colitis appears, therefore, to be a colonic manifestation of Behçet syndrome, differing from typical chronic nonspecific ulcerative colitis in terms of clinical course, severity, and histologic appearance. The simultaneous occurrence of Behçet syndrome and inflammatory disease of the colon was discussed in terms of the differential diagnosis of colitis.
