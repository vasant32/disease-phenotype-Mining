AIM: To study joint pathology in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 183 BD patients (128 males, 54females, mean age 32.0 +/- 9.8 years, age at BD onset 22.3 +/- 9.9 years, mean duration of the disease 9.5 +/- 8.9 years. RESULTS: Joint pathology occurred in 74.8% patients, in 10.9% patients the disease onset was associated with arthritis and arthralgia. 3 patients had aceptic necrosis of the head of the femur and knee joint, 3 patients--bone marrow infarction. Knee joints were affected more frequently than others (up to 40%) followed by ankle, elbow and radiocarpal and other joints. In BD duration about 10 years, none of the examinees had stage III of sacroiliitis, stage II was diagnosed only in 4 patients, stage I (suspicion)--in 9. Significant sacroillitis was not registered, bilateral sacroiliitis occurred only in 9 patients. HLA B5 was detected in 61% patients while HLA B27--only in 9.7%. CONCLUSION: The articular syndrome was seen in 3/4 of BD patients. Arthritis runs a recurrent course. Erosive arthritis, sacroiliitis and combination of the latter with HLA B27 are rare.
