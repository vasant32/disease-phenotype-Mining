 OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of Behcet's disease (BD) associated with bone marrow failure (BMF), classified as conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or aplastic anaemia (AA), in Korea. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of 13 patients with BD associated with BMF (MDS 8 cases, AA 5 cases) and 66 patients with BD not associated with BMF. These patients all fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the international BD study group. RESULTS: BD patients with BMF showed significantly lower leucocyte count, haemoglobin level and platelet count when compared with patients without BMF (P < 0.001). BD patients with BMF had significantly higher serum CRP level at the time of BD diagnosis compared with patients without BMF (P = 0.03). Intestinal lesions were more frequent in BD patients with BMF than those without BMF (61.5% vs 13.6%, P = 0.001). Cytogenetic abnormality was observed in 90.9% of BD patients with BMF. Of the cytogenetic abnormalities, trisomy 8 was most common, occurring in 70% of the patients. In four patients with refractory BD associated with BMF, successful treatment of BMF by haematopoietic stem cell transplantation resulted in clinical remission of BD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that intestinal ulceration is a characteristic finding in BD associated with BMF. It also suggests that cytogenetic aberration, especially trisomy 8, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD associated with BMF.
