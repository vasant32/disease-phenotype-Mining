Six cases of arterial aneurysms, due to "Behçet's disease" located in various arteries are presented. Surgical reconstruction included: Resection of the lesions and replacement with corresponding grafts with satisfactory results. In spite of the macroscopic similarity of the aneurysms found in "Behçet's disease" as compared to those of mycotic origin, the presence of any microorganism could not be detected in various cultures or pathological specimens. Meticulous diagnosis on the nature of the aneurysm, close follow-up and careful postoperative anticoagulant treatment, is imperative for satisfactory immediate and late results.
