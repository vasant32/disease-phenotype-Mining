Behçet's disease is a multisystem disease in which there is evidence of immunological dysregulation. It has been proposed that gamma/delta T cells are involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to assess the capacity of gamma/delta T cells with phenotype Vgamma9/Vdelta2, from a group of Italian patients with Behçet's disease, to proliferate in the presence of various phosphoantigens and to express tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-12 receptors. Twenty-five patients and 45 healthy individuals were studied. Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells were analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting, utilizing specific monoclonal antibodies. For the expansion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells, lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of various phosphoantigens. The expression of TNF receptor II and IL-12 receptor beta1 was evaluated with the simultaneous use of anti-TNF receptor II phycoerythrin-labelled (PE) or anti-IL-12 receptor beta1 PE and anti-Vdelta2 T-cell receptor fluorescein isothiocyanate. There was a certain hierarchy in the response of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells toward the different phosphoantigens, with the highest expansion factor obtained with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and the lowest with xylose 1P. The expansion factor was fivefold greater in patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease or in control individuals. TNF receptor II and IL-12 receptor beta1 expressions were increased in both patients and control individuals. The proportion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells bearing these receptors was raised in active disease when Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells were cultured in the presence of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These results indicate that Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell activation is correlated with disease progression and probably involved in the pathogenesis.
