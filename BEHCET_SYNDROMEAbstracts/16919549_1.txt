The aim of this prospective study was to determine and compare the orbital Doppler ultrasonography parameters of patients with Behçet's disease (with or without ocular involvement) with those of healthy subjects. We evaluated ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery, posterior ciliary artery (PCA), central retinal vein, and superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) flow velocities and resistance indices (RIs). Detection of the decreased flow velocities in the OA and SOV and the increased RI in the OA and PCA might allow the identification of active period of patients with Behçet's disease.
