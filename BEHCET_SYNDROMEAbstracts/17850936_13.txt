Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS; aphthae; canker sores) is common worldwide. Characterised by multiple, recurrent, small, round, or ovoid ulcers with circumscribed margins, erythematous haloes, and yellow or grey floors, it usually presents first in childhood or adolescence. Its aetiology and pathogenesis is not entirely clear, but there is genetic predisposition, with strong associations with interleukin genotypes, and sometimes a family history. Diagnosis is on clinical grounds alone, and must be differentiated from other causes of recurrent ulceration, particularly Beh√ßet disease - a systemic disorder in which aphthous-like ulcers are associated with genital ulceration, and eye disease (particularly posterior uveitis). Management remains unsatisfactory, as topical corticosteroids and most other treatments only reduce the severity of the ulceration, but do not stop recurrence.
