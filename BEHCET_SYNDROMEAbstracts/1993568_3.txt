Thirty patients with Beh√ßet disease (BD) were treated with oral indomethacin 25 mg four times daily for 3 months as an open label study. The study population consisted of 13 women and 17 men from 15 to 45 years of age (mean 27 years). At the initiation of the therapy, 28 patients had oral aphthous lesions, 23 had joint involvement, 13 had genital ulcerations, 8 had cutaneous lesions, and 4 had eye involvement. Eighty-eight percent of patients with skin lesions, 80% with joint involvement, 43% with oral aphthous lesions, and 38% with genital ulcerations responded to indomethacin therapy. In three patients indomethacin was changed to the suppository form due to gastrointestinal side effects. Although it is difficult to assess the efficacy of indomethacin in BD because of the intermittent nature of symptoms, the majority of patients showed improvement in their symptoms of arthritis and skin lesions. This study indicates that indomethacin can be used as effective therapy particularly in patients with joint involvement.
