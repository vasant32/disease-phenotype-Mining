 AIM: This study was designed to assess whether ultrasonic reflectivity, evaluated by integrated backscatter analysis was associated with the severity of inflammation and diastolic dysfunction of the left (LV) and right ventricles (RV) in Beh√ßet's disease (BD). METHODS: The study consisted of 20 patients with BD and 18 healthy controls. The expression of CD11b and CD63 on the surface of granulocytes and monocytes were measured by flow cytometry. RV and LV diastolic functions were assessed by tricuspid and mitral annular tissue Doppler recordings, respectively. Backscatter cyclic variation (CV) and maximal intensity (IB) were measured in RV lateral wall, interventricular septum, and posterior LV wall from parasternal long-axis view, apex from apical four-chamber view, anterior, inferior, and lateral LV walls from parasternal short axis view. RESULTS: The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD11b on granulocytes and CD63 on monocytes in BD patients was higher than those of controls. Patients with BD had smaller mitral and tricuspid annular early diastolic wave velocities and early/late diastolic wave velocity ratios (E/A) than controls. MFI of CD11b and CD63 was inversely correlated with tricuspid and mitral annular E/A in BD patients. CV of RV and global CV of LV were found to be diminished in BD patients than controls. CV of RV and global CV of LV showed a direct correlation with tricuspid and mitral annular E/A ratio, respectively. CONCLUSION: There is an association between the levels of cellular adhesion molecules, deterioration of diastolic function, and altered myocardial ultrasonic reflectivity in BD.
