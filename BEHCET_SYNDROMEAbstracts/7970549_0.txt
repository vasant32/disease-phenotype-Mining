We reviewed retrospectively the charts of 36 patients (72 eyes) with Beh√ßet's disease. The visual acuities in 21 patients receiving colchicine (group A) gradually decreased with time. The visual acuities in 9 patients receiving colchicine and systemic corticosteroid (group B) gradually decreased after the onset of the disease and were significantly worse than those in group A 10 and 15 years after onset. The visual acuities in 6 patients receiving colchicine and cyclosporin (group C) gradually decreased, and their visual acuity scores were similar to those in group A.
