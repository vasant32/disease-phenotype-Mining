Clinical features in two patients with Behcet's disease were dominated by "minor" manifestations of the disease--arthritis and central nervous system involvement in one, chronic stasis ulcers complicating thrombosis of the inferior vena cava in the other. In a third patient, the dominant clinical features were coincidental obstructive airway disease and cor pulmonale. Two patients developed a nephrotic syndrome; the third had intermittent trace proteinuria. Amyloidosis was proved by histologic examination in all three. The two patients examined post-mortem had no focus of chronic suppuration. There is a possibility that systemic amyloidosis is an intrinsic feature of Behcet's disease.
