<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The safety and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the IL-1 inhibitor, rilonacept (IL-1 Trap; 160 mg, subcutaneously), was studied in a group of 6 patients with well-controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) who were observed for a period of 42 days following dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety of rilonacept administration was ascertained by regular monitoring of patients for adverse events, by periodic determination of a battery of standard laboratory and hematology tests, and by testing for binding and neutralizing antibodies to rilonacept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the 6 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events that were moderate in intensity and unrelated to administration of rilonacept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, serious adverse events, or withdrawals due to adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patient developed binding or neutralizing antibodies to rilonacept by the 42nd day postdosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean C(max) estimated by a noncompartmental analysis was 17.2 mg/L; t(max,) 2.80 days; terminal t(1/2), 7.63 days; and AUC(0-infinity), 199.3 d.mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of these results to those obtained in a population of patients with cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e>, a group of rare, inherited, autoinflammatory disorders (mean [SD] eGFR of 73.1 [13.3] mL/min/1.73m2), shows that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> and related hemodialysis procedures do not prolong the elimination of rilonacept, and therefore no dose adjustment should be needed relative to individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function </plain></SENT>
