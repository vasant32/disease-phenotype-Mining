<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with autoinflammatory disease treated at the Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, over the past 10 years were included </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, diagnosis, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, disease duration, follow-up duration, clinical and laboratory variables, and outcome data were compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gathered laboratory data were part of patients' usual medical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (females, 53%) with autoinflammatory diseases were included (mean age, 151 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean disease duration was 118 months; mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 32 months; consanguinity was present in 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were diagnosed as follows: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, 50%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRMO</z:e>, 23.5%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>, 8.8%; EOS, 8.8%; MWS, 6%; and PFAPA, 2.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The referral diagnosis was inaccurate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gene study was informative in 9 of 14 FMF patients who had molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of our cohort had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with EOS had multiorgan involvement, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our report shows that autoinflammatory diseases other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> may be overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Increased awareness among pediatricians about these conditions will help to provide better health care to patients in the form of early diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
