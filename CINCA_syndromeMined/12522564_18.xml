<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FCAS was previously mapped to a 10-cM region on chromosome 1q44, and subsequently the gene ( CIAS1) responsible for FCAS was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe the physical and genetic mapping of the FCAS locus, and we report a large ancestral haplotype and a new disease-causing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A BAC contig of approximately 3 Mb was developed and subsequently used for high throughput sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a critical region of 4 cM using rare crossover events in four large North American FCAS families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An unusually large shared haplotype (40 cM) was identified in three of the four families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a single heterozygous missense mutation (T1058C=L353P) in exon 3 of CIAS1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four families that is responsible for the large majority of FCAS cases described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also report a comprehensive list of intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data provided here will assist others researching the 1q44 region and will aid clinicians in the diagnosis of FCAS </plain></SENT>
