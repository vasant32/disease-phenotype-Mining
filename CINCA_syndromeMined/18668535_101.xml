<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of rilonacept (Interleukin-1 [IL-1] Trap), a long-acting and potent inhibitor of IL-1, in patients with cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> (FCAS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven adult patients with CAPS, as defined by mutations in the causative NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene and pathognomonic symptoms, were enrolled in 2 consecutive phase III studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study 1 involved a 6-week randomized double-blind comparison of weekly subcutaneous injections of rilonacept (160 mg) versus placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study 2 consisted of 9 weeks of single-blind treatment with rilonacept (part A), followed by a 9-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal procedure (part B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy was evaluated using a validated composite key symptom score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four patients completed both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In study 1, rilonacept therapy reduced the group mean composite symptom score by 84%, compared with 13% with placebo therapy (primary end point; P &lt; 0.0001 versus placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rilonacept also significantly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other efficacy end points in study 1 (numbers of multisymptom and single-symptom disease flare days, single-symptom scores, physician's and patient's global assessments of disease activity, limitations in daily activities, and C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A [SAA] levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In study 2 part B, rilonacept was superior to placebo for maintaining the improvements seen with rilonacept therapy, as shown by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> efficacy parameters (primary end point; P &lt; 0.0001 versus placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rilonacept was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse events were injection site reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with weekly rilonacept provided marked and lasting improvement in the clinical signs and symptoms of CAPS, and normalized the levels of SAA from those associated with risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rilonacept exhibited a generally favorable safety and tolerability profile </plain></SENT>
