<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse gene expression patterns and to define a specific gene expression signature in patients with the severe end of the spectrum of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular consequences of interleukin 1 inhibition were examined by comparing gene expression patterns in 16 CAPS patients before and after treatment with anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 CAPS patients with active disease and from 14 healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcripts that passed stringent filtering criteria (p values â‰¤ false discovery rate 1%) were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A set of DEG was validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and functional studies with primary cells from CAPS patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used 17 CAPS and 66 non-CAPS patient samples to create a set of gene expression models that differentiates CAPS patients from controls and from patients with other autoinflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Many DEG include transcripts related to the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A set of gene expression-based models comprising the CAPS-specific gene expression signature correctly classified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 samples from an independent dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This classifier also correctly identified 15 of 16 post-anakinra CAPS samples despite the fact that these CAPS patients were in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified a gene expression signature that clearly distinguished CAPS patients from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A number of DEG were in common with other systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> such as systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CAPS-specific gene expression classifiers also suggest incomplete suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at low doses of anakinra </plain></SENT>
