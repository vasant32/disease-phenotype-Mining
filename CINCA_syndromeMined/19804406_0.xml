<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We screened ten exons of TNFRSF1A gene, and detected a heterozygous c.1080C&gt;G nucleotide substitution in exon 10 in both of the unrelated patients, resulting p.Y360X nonsense (protein truncated) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to classical TNFRSF1A gene nomenclature and the agreement of 30th amino acid as the first one, it is accepted as p.Y331X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was interesting to determine same mutations in fathers of two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one of the cases, E148Q heterozygous mutation, which is one of the disease-causing mutations of MEFV gene, was detected </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CIAS1 gene, two different nucleotide substitutions resulting synonymous amino acid mutation were detected in exon 3: c.[732G&gt;A] and c.[786A&gt;G] nucleotide substitutions and compatible p.A242A (according to c.DNA p.A244A) and p.R260R (according to c.DNA p.R262R) synonymous amino acid mutations </plain></SENT>
