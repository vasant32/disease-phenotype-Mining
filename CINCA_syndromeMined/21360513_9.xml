<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) is an inherited autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene that result in excessive interleukin-1 (IL-1) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>sensorineural deafness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recombinant IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> anakinra blocks the biologic activity of IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of anakinra therapy in children and adults with severe MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-center observational study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized assessments included clinical features, the Disease Activity Score (DAS) for MWS, classic and novel markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and patient-derived measures of health status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a score of &lt;10 on the DAS for MWS at 2 weeks and at the last followup visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measures of MWS disease activity were investigated using descriptive statistics and paired comparative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 12 patients with severe MWS (5 children and 7 adults) received anakinra for a median of 11 months (range 5-14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median followup was 11 months (range 5-14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at 2 weeks (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Organ manifestations of MWS improved, as did <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient-derived measures of health status, markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and hearing loss in 2 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Levels of the novel neutrophil activation biomarker S100A12 followed clinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anakinra was found to be a safe and effective treatment of severe MWS, leading to a significant improvement in disease activity at 2 weeks as well as long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Anakinra therapy should therefore be considered in children and adults with severe MWS disease requiring IL-1 blockade </plain></SENT>
