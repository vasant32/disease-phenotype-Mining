<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e>) is a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> that was recently found to be associated with mutations in CIAS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CIAS1 mutations have been detected in only half of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> patients, and it remains unclear which genes are responsible for the syndrome in the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> who exhibited CIAS1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genetically analyzed the CIAS1 gene in various blood cells and the buccal mucosa of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the ability of the mutant CIAS1 gene to enhance ASC-dependent NF-kappaB activation was assessed to confirm that the mutations of CIAS1 found were responsible for the patient's clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had 1 heterologous single-nucleotide polymorphism, 587G&gt;A (S196N), and 1 heterologous mutation, 1709A&gt;G (Y570C), in exon 3 of CIAS1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter mutation was found to occur as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's PBMCs produced a large amount of IL-1beta in the absence of stimulation, unlike those from controls or from his mother, who also bore the S196N polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Y570C mutation (with or without the S196N polymorphism) increased the ability of CIAS1 to induce ASC-dependent NF-kappaB activation, unlike the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> gene or the gene bearing the S196N polymorphism alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings in this patient indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> is one reason CIAS1 mutations have not been detected in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
