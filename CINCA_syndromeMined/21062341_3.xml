<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, purulent cerebrospinal fluid was present in the absence of evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy revealed a sparse infiltrate throughout the entire dermis, including the eccrine adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The infiltrate was composed mostly of neutrophils, but rarely lymphocytes and eosinophils could also be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the presenting attributes, a diagnosis of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) was considered and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal-onset</z:hpo> multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>) that represents the most severe expression of the CAPS clinical spectrum was favored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed by identification of a mutation in the cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome-1 gene and by an observed response to treatment with the interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the clinical and histopathological findings of the presented case may represent a distinct entity within the spectrum of aseptic neutrophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We refer to this spectrum as neutrophilic urticarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatosis</z:e> (NUD), which may serve as a cutaneous marker of autoinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NUD with perieccrine involvement should prompt consideration of CAPS, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>, in the context of neonatal multisystem disease </plain></SENT>
