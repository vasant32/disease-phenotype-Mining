<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> (FCAS) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> after cold exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of this disease has been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cryopyrin, the protein that is altered in FCAS, is one of the adaptor proteins that activate caspase 1, resulting in release of interleukin 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An experimental cold challenge protocol was developed to study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory mechanisms occurring after a general cold exposure in FCAS patients and to investigate the effects of pretreatment with an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1Ra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ELISA, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry were used to measure cytokine responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: After cold challenge, untreated patients with FCAS developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> within 1-4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in serum concentrations of interleukin 6 and white-blood-cell counts were seen 4-8 h after cold challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of interleukin 1 and cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in peripheral-blood leucocytes were not raised, but amounts of interleukin 1 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were high in affected skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-1Ra administered before cold challenge blocked symptoms and increases in white-blood-cell counts and serum interleukin 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The ability of IL-1Ra to prevent the clinical features and haematological and biochemical changes in patients with FCAS indicates a central role for interleukin 1beta in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Involvement of cryopyrin in activation of caspase 1 and NF-kappaB signalling suggests that it might have a role in many <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: These findings support a new therapy for a disorder with no previously known acceptable treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They also offer insights into the role of interleukin 1beta in more common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
