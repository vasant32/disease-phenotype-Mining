<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of the V198M variant is unclear; it has been reported in association with various CAPS phenotypes and as a variant of uncertain consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical phenotypes and treatments in individuals with V198M assessed in a single UK Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA samples from 830 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes or a family history of CAPS were screened for mutations in the NLRP3 gene by PCR and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed medical history was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory disease</z:e> activity was monitored monthly by measurements of serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in symptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NLRP3 V198M was identified in 19 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found in association with CAPS in five cases, in one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schnitzler syndrome</z:e>, in three patients, who also had a nucleotide alteration in another <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> gene, and in three other patients with evidence of an autoinflammatory phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven asymptomatic individuals were detected during screening of family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The NLRP3 V198M variant shows <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>reduced penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may be associated with classical inherited or apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> CAPS and with atypical autoinflammatory disease of varying severity, intriguingly including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schnitzler syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The factors that influence the pathogenic consequences of this variant remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the remarkable response to IL-1 blockade in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one individual in our series confirms that their clinical features are indeed mediated by IL-1 </plain></SENT>
