<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High levels of IL-1β have been implicated in the development of many diseases, including type 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1D and T2D), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>XOMA is developing gevokizumab (XOMA-052), an IgG2 humanized mAb against human IL-1β, for the potential treatment of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gevokizumab has a high affinity for IL-1β and a long t1/2, which would allow for once-monthly dosing and offer a considerable advantage for patients over agents requiring more frequent dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials suggest that gevokizumab is a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment for the indicated diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of publication, phase II clinical trials were ongoing in patients with T1D, T2D and RA, with the T2D trials assessing key cardiovascular markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following promising data from a recent pilot trial, XOMA was also planning a phase I/II trial of gevokizumab for the potential treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in patients with the vasculitic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and the autoinflammatory conditions <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
