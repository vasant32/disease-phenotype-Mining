<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-IL-1 monoclonal antibody (canakinumab) was recently registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However no clear data is available on the optimal schedule of administration of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyse the impact of canakinumab on CAPS patients in daily clinical practice and to identify the best schedule of administration according to age and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 13 CAPS patients (10 children and 3 young adults) treated with canakinumab were followed for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was recorded at month 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete response was defined as absence of clinical manifestations and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory variables at last follow-up were compared with those registered at the moment of anakinra discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Infantile Neurological Cutaneous Articular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>) syndrome, 4 patients with as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) and 2 patients with an overlapping MWS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> phenotype were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> patients experienced an higher number of modifications of the treatment (increased dosage or decreased dosing interval) in respect to MWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> patients displayed a higher frequency of administration with a median dose of 3.7 mg/kg (2.1 mg/kg for MWS patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab was withdrawn in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> for incomplete response and poor compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect of canakinumab on HRQoL was similar to that observed during treatment with anakinra, with the exception of an improvement of the psychosocial concepts after the introduction of canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of canakinumab in daily practice is associated with a persistent satisfactory control of disease activity but needs a progressive dose adjustments in more severe patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The clinical phenotype, rather than the age, represents the main variable able to determine the need of more frequent administrations of the drug at higher dosage </plain></SENT>
