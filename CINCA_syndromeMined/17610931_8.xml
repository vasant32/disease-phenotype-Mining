<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The samples were collected up- and downstream from an industrial park </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 fishes, 6 sediments and 3 water samples were analyzed for polybrominated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ethers</z:chebi> (PBDEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analytical work included 23 congeners, from tri- to deca-BDEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest values for both sediment and fish samples were found downstream of the industrial park </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High BDE-209 contamination was found in these sediment samples, with values up to 12 microg g(-1) dry weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BDE-209 was detected in 14 out of 15 biota samples collected downstream the industrial park, at concentration levels ranging from 20 to 707 ng g(-1) <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> weight, whereas it was not detected in samples collected upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These fish concentrations proved the bioavailability of BDE-209 and represented the highest deca-BDE values found in aquatic biota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The analysis of industrial effluents revealed that some industries contribute in some way to the BDE-209 contamination found in this area, but the industry focused on the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="53224">polyamide</z:chebi> polymerization is the main responsible </plain></SENT>
