<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the synthesis, processing, and secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), as well as the clinical and biologic effects of IL-1 blockade, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>) syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS), in an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms linking mutations of the CIAS1 gene and IL-1beta hypersecretion, and the underlying response to IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1Ra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> or MWS were treated with IL-1Ra and followed up longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monocytes obtained from the patients and from 24 healthy donors were activated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) for 3 hours, and intracellular and secreted IL-1beta levels were determined by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after exposure to exogenous ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LPS-induced IL-1beta secretion was markedly increased in monocytes from patients with CIAS1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, unlike in healthy subjects, secretion of IL-1beta was not induced by exogenous ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with IL-1Ra resulted in a dramatic clinical improvement, which was paralleled by an early and strong down-regulation of LPS-induced IL-1beta secretion by the patients' cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the requirements of ATP stimulation for IL-1beta release observed in healthy individuals are bypassed in patients bearing CIAS1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that cryopyrin is the direct target of ATP and that the mutations release the protein from the requirement of ATP for activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the dramatic amelioration induced by IL-1Ra treatment is at least partly due to the strong decrease in IL-1beta secretion that follows the first injections of the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory conditions characterized by increased IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
