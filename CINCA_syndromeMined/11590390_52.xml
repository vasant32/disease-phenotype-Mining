<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to formulate clinical diagnostic criteria for FCAS in a large cohort in whom the diagnosis of FCAS was supported by genetic linkage to chromosome 1q44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed 45 affected and 68 unaffected members from 6 American families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis was performed to confirm linkage to chromosome 1q44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics were determined by means of analysis of detailed questionnaires and medical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pedigree and genetic analyses confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission and linkage to chromosome 1q44 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most consistent symptoms during attacks were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (100%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (93%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> (96%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>Age of onset</z:hpo> was within the first 6 months of life in 95% of affected subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average delay between cold exposure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 2.5 hours, and the average duration of an episode was 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> occurs infrequently in FCAS (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most consistent clinical characteristics of FCAS that discriminate it from other periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> are association with cold exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, duration of episodes, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the analysis of genotype and phenotype of FCAS, we formulated clinical diagnostic criteria that can be used to distinguish FCAS from other hereditary periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
