<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> (FCAS) is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> condition characterized by unremitting attacks of cold-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>, often accompanied by other systemic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disorder was previously shown to be caused by mutations in CIAS1, encoding a pyrin-like protein also involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, using direct sequencing, we assessed a two-generation family of Jewish Ethiopian origin, including 3 members affected with FCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a novel CIAS1 mutation, F525C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation was shown to affect a highly conserved residue of the protein and to segregate with the disease throughout the extended family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to the expanding spectrum of mutations in CIAS1 and provide evidence for striking phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in inherited autoinflammatory syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of inherited cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> in a family of Ethiopian origin </plain></SENT>
