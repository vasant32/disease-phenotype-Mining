<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Description of the audiometric and vestibular characteristics of a Dutch family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> family members consisted of pure tone audiometry, otoscopy and genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a selected group underwent speech audiometry, vestibulo-ocular examination, acoustic reflex testing and tests assessing loudness scaling, gap detection, difference limen for frequency and speech perception in noise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses were performed on the audiometric data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six clinically affected family members participated in this study and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were carriers of a p.Tyr859His mutation in the NLPR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most affected family members reported bilateral, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> since childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>Hearing impairment</z:hpo> started at the high frequencies and the low- and mid-frequency threshold values deteriorated with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Annual threshold deterioration (ATD) ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 dB/year with the highest values at the lower frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal linear regression analysis demonstrated significant progression for a number of frequencies in five individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Speech recognition scores were clearly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, these individuals tended to have higher speech recognition scores than presbyacusis patients at similar <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>(1,2,4 kHz) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The loudness growth curves were steeper than those found in individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearing, except for one family member (individual IV:6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Suprathreshold measurements, such as difference limen for frequency (DL(f)), gap detection and particularly speech perception in noise were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range or at least close to data obtained in two groups of patients with a so-called conductive type of hearing loss, situated in the cochlea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>Hearing impairment</z:hpo> in MWS is variable and shows resemblance to previously described intra-cochlear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This could be helpful in elucidating the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> in MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Other associated symptoms of MWS were mild and nonspecific in the present family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, even without any obvious syndromic features, MWS can be the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>sensorineural hearing impairment</z:hpo>, especially when combined with (mild) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> and musculoskeletal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>An early diagnosis of MWS is essential to prevent irreversible damage from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The effect of IL-1β inhibitors on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> is more controversial, but an early start of treatment seems to be essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results are of importance in patient care and counselling </plain></SENT>
