<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However 5% to 10% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> are unresponsive or intolerant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biologics are efficient in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e>, psoriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review to analyze patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, including juvenile patients who received treatment with biologics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: A MEDLINE search, including articles published in English language between 1990 and May 2012, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had MEFV variants but could not be classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> according to Tel-Hashomer criteria were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: There is no controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of biologics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine (32 female and 27 male) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> who had been treated with biologics (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, anakinra, and canakinumab) were reported in 24 single reports and 7 case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 16 children and 43 adults (7- to 68-year olds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients were reported to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> intolerance or had adverse events related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> use, and the rest 54 were unresponsive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: The current data are limited to case reports, and it is difficult to obtain a quantitative evaluation of response to biologic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, on the basis of reported cases, biologic agents seem to be an alternative treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> who are unresponsive or intolerant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> therapy and seem to be safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Controlled studies are needed to better evaluate the safety and efficacy of biologics in the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
