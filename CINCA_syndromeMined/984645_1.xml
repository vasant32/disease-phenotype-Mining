<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The existence of incomplete forms, either without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001917'>renal amyloidosis</z:hpo> should be known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This perceptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> is very probably due to lesion of the internal ear but the histological characteristics do not seem to be very clear at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, as certain of our observations show, in a few cases, conduction may be impaired, either in isolation, or associated with impairment of perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only an analysis of a large number of cases will enable the audiological characteristics of this curious syndrome to be defined </plain></SENT>
