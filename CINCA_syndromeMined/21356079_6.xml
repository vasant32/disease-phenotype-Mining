<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CAPS is a rare hereditary auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, which may start early in childhood and requires a life-long treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab, a fully human anti-IL-1β antibody, produces sustained selective inhibition of IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of canakinumab in the treatment of pediatric CAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven pediatric patients (five children and two adolescents) with CAPS were enrolled in a phase II, open-label study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab was administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.) (for patients with body weight ≤ 40 kg) or 150 mg s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(for patients with body weight &gt; 40 kg) with re-dosing upon each relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy variable was time to relapse following achievement of a complete response (defined as a global assessment of no or minimal disease activity and no or minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> and values for serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or serum amyloid A (SAA) within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, &lt; 10 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved a complete response within seven days after the first dose of canakinumab and responses were reinduced on retreatment following relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvements in symptoms were evident within 24 hours after the first dose, according to physician assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimated median time to relapse was 49 days (95% CI 29 to 68) in children who received a dose of 2 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One serious adverse event, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, was reported, but resolved during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab, 2 mg/kg or 150 mg s.c., induced rapid and sustained clinical and biochemical responses in pediatric patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00487708 </plain></SENT>
