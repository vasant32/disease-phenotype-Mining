<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 48-week, phase 3 study, patients with CAPS received canakinumab 150 mg subcutaneously at 8-week intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (n = 35) received canakinumab during weeks 1 through 8; weeks 9 through 24 constituted a double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal phase, and weeks 24 through 48 constituted an open-label phase in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient and physician assessments of symptoms, levels of inflammatory markers, and HRQoL were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rapid symptom remission was achieved, with 89% of patients having no or minimal disease activity on day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were sustained in patients receiving 8-weekly canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses were lost during the placebo-controlled phase in the placebo group and were regained on resuming canakinumab therapy in the open-label phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical responses were accompanied by decreases in serum levels of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, and interleukin-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HRQoL scores at baseline were considerably below those of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) domain scores were evident by day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Scores approached or exceeded those of the general U.S. population by week 8 and remained stable during canakinumab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvements in bodily pain and role-physical were particularly marked, increasing by more than 25 points from baseline to week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therapy was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab, 150 mg, 8-weekly, induced rapid and sustained remission of symptoms in patients with CAPS, accompanied by substantial improvements in HRQoL </plain></SENT>
