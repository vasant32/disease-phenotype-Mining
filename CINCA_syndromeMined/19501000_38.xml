<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the NLRP3 gene cause the autoinflammatory disease spectrum cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The central role of IL-1beta in CAPS is supported by the response to IL-1-targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed two Nlrp3 mutant knockin mouse strains to model CAPS to examine the role of other <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> and adaptive immune responses in an innate immune-driven disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mice had systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>poor growth</z:hpo>, similar to some human CAPS patients, and demonstrated early mortality, primarily mediated by myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mating these mutant mice to various gene mutant backgrounds showed that the mouse disease phenotype required an intact inflammasome, was only partially dependent on IL-1beta, and was independent of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CAPS are true inflammasome-mediated diseases and provide insight for more common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
