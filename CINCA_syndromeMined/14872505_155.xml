<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies suggest that NALP3 is involved in the processing of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), prompting us to investigate whether IL-1 blockade may be therapeutic in patients with MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features of 3 members of a family, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had MWS associated with the NALP3 variant V200M (also designated V198M), and evaluated the response of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> to treatment with the recombinant human IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects kept a diary of symptoms and underwent fortnightly clinical and laboratory assessments, including measurement of the serum amyloid A protein concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each subject had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>sensorineural deafness</z:hpo>, and an intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response characteristic of MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, additional features were identified, including exacerbation of their disease by cold and neurologic manifestations, that have hitherto been described only in FCAS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and serologic evidence of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> resolved rapidly and completely during treatment with anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The remarkable response of MWS to anakinra suggests that IL-1beta has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> associated with mutations in the NALP3 gene, and supports study of IL-1 inhibition in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> or FCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of the various syndromes associated with mutations in the NALP3 gene may overlap to a greater extent than has previously been recognized </plain></SENT>
