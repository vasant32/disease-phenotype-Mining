<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing features include cutaneous, neurological, ophthalmologic, and rheumatologic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAPS results from a gain-of-function mutation of the NLRP3 gene coding for cryopyrin, which forms intracellular protein complexes known as inflammasomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defects of the inflammasomes lead to overproduction of interleukin-1, resulting in inflammatory symptoms seen in CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is often delayed and requires a thorough review of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkable advances in our understanding of the genetics and the molecular pathway that is responsible for the clinical phenotype of CAPS has led to the development of effective treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also has become clear that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in innate immune defense and therefore has wider implications for other inflammatory <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
