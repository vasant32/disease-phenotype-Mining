<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite having indistinguishable clinical features, some patients lack CIAS1 mutations by conventional nucleotide sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently reported a CAPS patient with mosaicism of mutant CIAS1, and raised the possibility that CIAS1 mutations were overlooked in "mutation-negative" patients, due to a low frequency of mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether there were latent mutant cells in "mutation-negative" patients, we sought to identify mutation-associated biologic phenotypes of patients' monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> selectively induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-like cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in monocytes bearing CIAS1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> correlated with CIAS1 up-regulation, was dependent on cathepsin B, and was independent of caspase-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was intrinsic to CIAS1-mutated monocytes, was not mediated by the inflammatory milieu, and was independent of disease severity or anti-IL-1 therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By collecting dying monocytes after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> treatment, we succeeded in enriching CIAS1-mutant monocytes and identifying low-level CIAS1-mosaicism in 3 of 4 "mutation-negative" CAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings reveal a novel effect of CIAS1 mutations in promoting <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-like cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and demonstrate that CIAS1 mosaicism plays an important role in mutation-negative CAPS patients </plain></SENT>
