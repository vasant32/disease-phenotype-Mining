<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Q703K allele is a variant of unknown pathogenetic significance, and has been considered to be both a clinically unremarkable polymorphism and a low- penetrance mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyse the long-term clinical course in a cohort of patients presenting with periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> attacks and carrying the Q703K mutation in the NLRP3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven Caucasian patients (mean age 37.3±8.5 years, 2 males and 5 females) were identified as carriers of the Q703K mutation among 71 patients with CAPS-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 25.58±16.08 years and the mean disease duration was 12.28±8.36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of febrile episodes was 7.56±6.48 and the mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> attacks was 6.66±4.71 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six out of 7 patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low grade fever</z:hpo>, while 1 patient had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were characterised by symptoms consistent with recurrent inflammatory syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients out of 7 presented <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, 4/7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, 4/7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>, 4/7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, 3/7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients also complained of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 4/7 patients symptoms were triggered or worsened by generalised cold exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that patients carrying the low-penetrance Q703K mutation in the NLRP3 gene may present with FCAS-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, given the high frequency of healthy carriers, the role of additional, still unknown genetic and/or environmental modifiers is conceivable </plain></SENT>
