<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of patients with classic presentation lack mutations in the coding region of NLRP3 suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> or epigenetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cryopyrin is a key regulator of proinflammatory cytokine release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, variations in the NLRP3 promoter sequence may have effects on disease state in patients with cryopyrinopathies and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report, we confirmed three 5'-untranslated region splice forms with two separate transcriptional start sites, and identified potential promoter regions and six new DNA promoter variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One variant is unique to a mutation negative cryopyrinopathy patient and increases in vitro gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional studies can now be performed to further characterize the NLRP3 promoter and sequence variants, which will lead to better understanding of the regulation of NLRP3 expression and its role in disease </plain></SENT>
