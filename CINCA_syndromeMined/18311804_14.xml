<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with MWS have a mutation in CIAS1, the gene encoding cryopyrin, a component of the inflammasome that regulates the processing of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe an 8-year-old Japanese girl with MWS who had symptoms of periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042109" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urticarial rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo>, and sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory analysis of the patient's serum showed abnormally high concentrations of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and IL-1beta, and she had a heterozygous mutation in the CIAS1 gene, with C-to-T transversion at nucleotide position 778, encoding an arginine-to-tryptophan mutation at position 260 (R260W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolated from the patient secreted large amounts of IL-1beta, without stimulation, and were highly sensitive to muramyldipeptide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment with anakinra, laboratory results normalized, and clinical symptoms, including sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, disappeared, while MNCs appeared to remain activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our case suggests that anakinra possibly affects the cryopyrin inflammasome and markedly improves the clinical and laboratory manifestations of MWS </plain></SENT>
