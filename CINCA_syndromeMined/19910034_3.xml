<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Acquired cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> (ACU) is usually a self-limited, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, cutaneous disease diagnosed based on history and a positive cold stimulation time test (CSTT) result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe 3 unrelated families (A, B, and C) with lifelong atypical cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> distinguished from ACU and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> of cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> and study its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Questionnaires, interviews, physical examinations, skin testing, and biopsies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absolute values, means, and prevalence percentages of data are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five subjects are described with familial atypical cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> (FACU; family A, 17; family B, 8; and family C, 10) displaying an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tested subjects had negative CSTT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Completed questionnaires from affected and unaffected members of families A and B (n = 35) revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected subjects had lifelong symptoms that began in early childhood with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> after cold exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>Angioedema</z:hpo> (family A, 23%; family B, 42%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, near <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, or both (family A, 46%; family B, 86%) were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Triggers included cold atmosphere (100%), aquatic activities (family A, 92%; family B, 100%), handling cold objects (family A, 54%; family B, 71%), and ingestion of cold foods or beverages (family A, 69%; family B, 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy specimens demonstrated a mast cell infiltrate with the appearance of degranulation after cold challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FACU is a new cold-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> that is different than ACU in its natural history, atmospheric cold elicitation, severity of systemic reactions, and CSTT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FACU differs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> in symptom timing and the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, chills, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cause is suspected to be mast cell related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment of reactions is similar to that for ACU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of pathogenesis and genetics is warranted </plain></SENT>
