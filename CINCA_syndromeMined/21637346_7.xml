<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both mouse and human IL-1β has been indicated as a key cytokine for the commitment to T(H)-17 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) are a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> associated with mutations of the NLRP3 gene encoding the inflammasome component cryopyrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work we asked whether the deregulated secretion of IL-1β secondary to mutations characterizing these patients could affect the IL-23/IL-17 axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 11 CAPS, 26 systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (SoJIA) patients and 20 healthy controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-17 and IL-6 serum were assessed by ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of T(H)17 cells was quantified upon staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secretion of IL-1β, IL-23 and IL-6 by monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs), were quantified by ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 8 CAPS and 11 SoJIA patients were also analysed before and after treatment with IL-1β blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Untreated CAPS patients showed significantly increased IL-17 serum levels as well as a higher frequency of T(H)17 compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, SoJIA patients displayed a frequency of T(H)17 similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, but were found to have significantly increased serum level of IL-6 when compared to CAPS patients or healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, decreased IL-17 serum levels and T(H)17 frequency were observed in CAPS patients following in vivo IL-1β blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the same line, MoDCs from CAPS patients exhibited enhanced secretion of IL-1β and IL-23 upon TLRs stimulation, with a reduction after anti-IL-1 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings further support the central role of IL-1β in the differentiation of T(H)17 in human inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
