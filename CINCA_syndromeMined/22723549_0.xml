<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the generation of NLRP3-mutant and nonmutant-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 2 CINCA syndrome patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo>, and describe their differentiation into macrophages (iPS-MPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that mutant cells are predominantly responsible for the pathogenesis in these mosaic patients because only mutant iPS-MPs showed the disease relevant phenotype of abnormal IL-1β secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed that the existing anti-inflammatory compounds inhibited the abnormal IL-1β secretion, indicating that mutant iPS-MPs are applicable for drug screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> and other NLRP3-related inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results illustrate that patient-derived iPSCs are useful for dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> and that NLRP3-mutant iPSCs can provide a valuable platform for drug discovery for multiple NLRP3-related disorders </plain></SENT>
