<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the pathophysiology of an atypical familial form of an autoinflammatory disorder, characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, increased secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and the absence of any cutaneous manifestations, and to assess the functional consequences of a missense mutation identified in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Microsatellite markers were used to test the familial segregation of the NLRP3 locus with the disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> NLRP3 exons were screened for mutations by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional assays were performed in HEK 293T cells to determine the effects of mutated (versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) NLRP3 proteins on NF-kappaB activation, caspase 1 signaling, and speck formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A heterozygous NLRP3 missense mutation (p.Tyr859Cys) was identified in exon 6, which encodes the LRR domain of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mutation was found to segregate with the disease phenotype within the family, and had a moderate activating effect on speck formation and procaspase 1 processing and did not alter the inhibitory properties of NLRP3 on NF-kappaB signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report is the first to describe a familial form of a cryopyrinopathy associated with a mutation outside of exon 3 of NLRP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding, together with the known efficacy of anti-IL-1 treatments in these disorders, underlines the importance of screening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons of NLRP3 in patients who present with atypical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the gain of function associated with this mutation in terms of activation of caspase 1 signaling was consistent with the observed inflammatory phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study of the functional consequences of an LRR mutation sheds new light on the clinical relevance of in vitro assays </plain></SENT>
