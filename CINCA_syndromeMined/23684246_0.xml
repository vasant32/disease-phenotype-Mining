<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As anti-cytokine therapies were developed for clinical use during the last decade, anti-IL-1 therapies have emerged as a highly effective treatment for cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPSs), including the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>." Based on clinical observations, we hypothesized that NLPR3 activation and IL-1β production, in particular in mast cells (MCs), are important for the development of this eruption, due to the observation that CAPS patients have gain-of-function mutations in NLRP3 that result in unregulated excess levels of IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further address our hypothesis, we employed gene-targeted mice carrying Nlrp3 mutations and found that signaling in MCs following <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> colonization of skin is essential for IL-1β-dependent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intradermal administration of a molecule that induces the release of granule-associated molecules from MCs showed that MCs and TNF-α were necessary for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in CAPS-mimicking mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, adult CAPS mice exhibited a persistent skin phenotype and did not respond to anti-TNF-α antibody, indicating that TNF-α is important only for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease and is dispensable during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this review, we highlight our recent findings on how MCs play an important role, not only in ordinary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>, but also in the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>" associated with NLRP3 mutations </plain></SENT>
