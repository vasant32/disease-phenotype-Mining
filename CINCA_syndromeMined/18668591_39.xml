<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of rilonacept (IL-1 Trap), a long-acting IL-1 receptor fusion protein, in patients with FCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with FCAS were studied in an open-label trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received an initial loading dose of 300 mg of rilonacept by subcutaneous injection, were evaluated 6 and 10 days later for clinical efficacy, and remained off treatment until a clinical flare occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of flare, patients were again treated with 300 mg of rilonacept and then given maintenance doses of 100 mg/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients whose FCAS was not completely controlled were allowed a dosage increase to 160 mg/week and then further to 320 mg/week during an intrapatient dosage-escalation phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety, disease activity measures (daily diary reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo> and/or swelling, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo>), health quality measures (Short Form 36 health survey questionnaire), and serum markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], serum amyloid A [SAA], and IL-6) were determined at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after initiation of rilonacept and were compared with baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, clinical symptoms typically induced by cold (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo>/swelling) improved within days of rilonacept administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (ESR, hsCRP, and SAA) showed statistically significant reductions (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001, and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) at doses of 100 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dosage escalation to 160 mg and 320 mg resulted in subjectively better control of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, levels of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants ESR, hsCRP, and SAA were lower at the higher doses; the difference was statistically significant only for the ESR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients continued taking the study drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The drug was well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp> in 2 patients was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No study drug-related serious adverse events were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, we present 2-year safety and efficacy data on rilonacept treatment in 5 patients with FCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The dramatic improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, the sustained response, and the good tolerability suggest that this drug may be a promising therapeutic option in patients with FCAS, and the data led to the design of a phase III study in this patient population </plain></SENT>
