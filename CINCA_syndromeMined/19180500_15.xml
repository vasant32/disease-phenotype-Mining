<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Blau syndrome is a rare, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo>, autoinflammatory disorder characterized by granulomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetics studies have shown that the disease is caused by single nonsynonymous substitutions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-2, a member of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-like receptor or NACHT-leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family of intracellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several NLRs function in the innate immune system as sensors of pathogen components and participate in immune-mediated cellular responses via the caspase 1 inflammasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in a gene related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-2, NLRP3, are responsible for excess caspase 1-dependent interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in cryopyrinopathies such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, functional studies demonstrate that caspase 1-mediated release of IL-1beta also involves <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that IL-1beta may mediate the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> seen in patients with Blau syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-1beta release was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in vitro, obtained from 5 Blau syndrome individuals with a NOD2 (CARD15) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed no evidence for increased IL-1beta production in cells obtained from subjects with Blau syndrome compared with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we presented 2 cases of Blau syndrome in which recombinant human IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (anakinra) was ineffective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that in contrast to related IL-1beta-dependent autoinflammatory cryopyrinopathies, Blau syndrome is not mediated by excess IL-1beta or other IL-1 activity </plain></SENT>
