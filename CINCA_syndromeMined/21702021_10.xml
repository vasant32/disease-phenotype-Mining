<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although heterozygous germline gain-of-function NLRP3 mutations are a known cause of this disease, conventional genetic analyses fail to detect disease-causing mutations in ∼40% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since somatic NLRP3 mosaicism has been detected in several mutation-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> patients, we undertook this study to determine the precise contribution of somatic NLRP3 mosaicism to the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An international case-control study was performed to detect somatic NLRP3 mosaicism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> patients who had shown no mutation during conventional sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcloning and sequencing of NLRP3 was performed in these mutation-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> patients and their healthy relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical features were analyzed to identify potential genotype-phenotype associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Somatic NLRP3 mosaicism was identified in 18 of the 26 patients (69.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimates of the level of mosaicism ranged from 4.2% to 35.8% (mean ± SD 12.1 ± 7.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism was not detected in any of the 19 healthy relatives (18 of 26 patients versus 0 of 19 relatives; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro functional assays indicated that the detected somatic NLRP3 mutations had disease-causing functional effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differences in NLRP3 mosaicism were detected between different cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among nondescript clinical features, a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> was noted in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Genotype-matched comparison confirmed that patients with somatic NLRP3 mosaicism presented with milder neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Somatic NLRP3 mutations were identified in 69.2% of patients with mutation-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This indicates that somatic NLRP3 mosaicism is a major cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
