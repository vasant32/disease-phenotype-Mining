<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classically, four such diseases were recognized, namely familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (previously called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FMF">periodic disease</z:e> in France), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e>, Hibernian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and hyper IgD with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The discovery of culprit genes has led to an overhaul of this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis of these diseases, that are difficult to identify on clinical grounds alone, is now possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Timely diagnosis is particularly important as, in the absence of treatment, there is a risk of secondary AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, which is fatal within 5 to 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discovery of underlying genetic mechanisms has also led to the development of new therapeutic approaches, which are currently being tested in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
