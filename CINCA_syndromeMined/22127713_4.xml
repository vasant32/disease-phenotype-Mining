<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are disorders of Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> that are characterized by mutations in genes that regulate innate immunity and whose typical features are systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> without high-titer autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Skin and bone <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the newborn period have been described in 3 of these autoinflammatory disorders: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal-onset</z:hpo> multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, Majeed syndrome, and deficiency of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (DIRA) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to present the characteristics of the DIRA syndrome in 2 cases from Brazil, and describe a novel mutation in IL1RN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two unrelated Brazilian patients were evaluated for the clinical signs and symptoms of these 3 disorders, and peripheral blood samples were assessed for mutations in NLRP3, LPIN2, and IL1RN by DNA resequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mutation in IL1RN that encodes a mutant protein was identified, and the expression and function of this mutant protein were compared to those of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients presented with pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> resembling generalized pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>, recurrent multifocal aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo>, and elevation in the levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are features most consistent with the DIRA syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006528'>Chronic lung disease</z:hpo> was observed in 1 of the patients, and jugular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was observed in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients showed a partial response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy, and 1 patient experienced an initial improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50173">acitretin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients were homozygous for a novel 15-bp (in-frame) deletion on the IL1RN gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutated protein expressed in vitro had no affinity with the IL-1 receptor, and stimulation of the patients' cells with recombinant human IL-1α or IL-1β led to oversecretion of proinflammatory cytokines, similar to the findings obtained in previously reported patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of the same homozygous novel mutation in IL1RN in 2 unrelated Brazilian patients suggests that this genetic variant may be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutation that has been introduced in the Brazilian population </plain></SENT>
