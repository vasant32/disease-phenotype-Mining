<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a multicentre effort, we set out to register genetic, epidemiological and clinical features as well as prognostic factors of these diseases by prospective longitudinal and long-term documentation, in order to define novel AIDs and to better understand treatment responses and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 2009, a federally funded clinical and research consortium (AID-Net) was established, including an online registry for AIDs (http://www.aid-register.uk-essen.de) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria are disease-associated mutations for hereditary periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HIDS</z:e>), TNF receptor 1-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e>) and cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (CAPS)], or, alternatively, clinically confirmed AID, systemic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> (SoJIA) and periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pharyngitis</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> (PFAPA) syndrome with unknown genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were recruited to the registry and patient material was deposited in biomaterial banks (DNA/serum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, basic research projects were initiated that focus on molecular mechanisms of AID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first 9 months, 117 patients (65 males, 52 females; age 1-21 years) have been recorded and classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> (n=84), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HIDS</z:e> (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e> (n=3) and CAPS (n=1); clinically confirmed AID (n=5); SoJIA (n=22); and PFAPA (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty blood samples of 18 patients were included in biomaterial banks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recruitment and follow-up of patients with AID will enable us to comprehensively address the correlation between clinical and epidemiological data, genetics and biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The translational approach may help to identify genetic or inflammatory markers relevant for the course and outcome of diseases </plain></SENT>
