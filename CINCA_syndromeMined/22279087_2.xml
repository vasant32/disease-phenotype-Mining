<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently found a high incidence of NLRP3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> in apparently mutation-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> patients using subcloning and subsequent capillary DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is important to rapidly diagnose somatic NLRP3 mosaicism to ensure proper treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this approach requires large investments of time, cost, and labour that prevent routine genetic diagnosis of low-level somatic NLRP3 mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We developed a routine pipeline to detect even a low-level allele of NLRP3 with statistical significance using massively parallel DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address the critical concern of discriminating a low-level allele from sequencing errors, we first constructed error rate maps of 14 polymerase chain reaction products covering the entire coding NLRP3 exons on a Roche 454 GS-FLX sequencer from 50 control samples without mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we formulated a statistical confidence value for each sequence variation in each strand to discriminate sequencing errors from real genetic variation even in a low-level allele, and thereby detected base substitutions at an allele frequency as low as 1% with 99.9% or higher confidence </plain></SENT>
