<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In MWS, NLRP3 gene mutations are associated with excessive interleukin-1 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine the otologic characteristics of MWS, define trajectories of hearing loss, and explore the association with distinct NLRP3 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study of children and adults diagnosed as having MWS was conducted at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NLRP3 gene mutations were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent standardized clinical, laboratory, and otologic assessments, including pure tone audiometry, vestibular organ testing, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trajectories of hearing loss were defined for each genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genotype-specific risk of progression of hearing loss was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 33 patients ages 3-75 years who were members of 5 families with 4 different NLRP3 gene mutations were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (67%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0008619'>bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even in cases of profound hearing loss vestibular reactivity remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fourteen adult patients reported nondebilitating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> progressed with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with the T348M mutation were at highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with MWS are at risk of developing progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> without vestibular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>Hearing impairment</z:hpo> starts at high frequencies and can subsequently progress to profound hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Progression is age dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with different NLRP3 mutations had distinctly different trajectories of hearing loss, suggesting a mutation-specific risk that should be considered when making treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
