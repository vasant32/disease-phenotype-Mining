<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present here a 13-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> treated with anakinra and low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> since he was 7 years old for an overall period of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Every clinical manifestation was highly responsive to interleukin-1 blockade, with the exception of his bone abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the comparison of radiography and magnetic resonance imaging of his knees made respectively at 7 and 13 years, we noticed a bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> on the posterior surface of the patella combined with the progression of distal femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and endosteal thinning of both meta-epiphyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report must encourage clinicians in a precocious institution of interleukin-1 antagonists to thwart the occurrence of irreversible bone changes </plain></SENT>
