<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-1-inhibition with anakinra, an IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, improves clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subclinical disease activity is commonly observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab, a fully human IgG1 anti-IL-1beta monoclonal antibody, can abolish excess IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of these two anti-IL-1 therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two cohorts of patients with severe MWS and confirmed NLRP3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) mutation were treated with anakinra and/or canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory features including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and the neutrophil marker S100A12 were determined serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was captured by MWS disease activity scores (MWS-DAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remission was defined as MWS-DAS [less than or equal to] 5 plus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CRP and SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment efficacy and safety were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 12 anakinra- and 14 canakinumab-treated patients; the median age was 33.5 years (3.0 - 72.0); 57% were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both treatment regimens led to a significant reduction of clinical disease activity and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 75% of anakinra-treated and 93% of canakinumab-treated patients achieved remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, S100A12 levels mirrored recurrence of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both treatment regimens had favorable safety profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL-1 blockade is an effective and safe treatment in MWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>MWS-DAS in combination with MWS inflammatory markers provides an excellent monitoring tool set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab led to a sustained control of disease activity even after secondary failure of anakinra therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>S100A12 may be a sensitive marker to detect subclinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
