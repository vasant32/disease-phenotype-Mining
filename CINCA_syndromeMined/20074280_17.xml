<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the potent proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 in disease could clinically be investigated with the development of the IL-1 blocking agent anakinra (Kineret), a recombinant IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was first tested in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> without much benefit but was later FDA approved for the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently IL-1 blocking therapies are used successfully to treat a new group of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions, autoinflammatory diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These conditions include rare hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes and pediatric and adult conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087031" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Still's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently the FDA approved two additional longer acting IL-1 blocking agents, for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS), an IL-1 dependent autoinflammatory syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study of autoinflammatory diseases revealed mechanisms of IL-1 mediated organ damage and provided concepts to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of more common diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> and Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> which show initial promising results with IL-1 blocking therapy </plain></SENT>
