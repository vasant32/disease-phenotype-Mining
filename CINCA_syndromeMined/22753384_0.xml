<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dysregulated production of cytokines downstream of interleukin (IL)-1 participates in the pathophysiology of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary monocytes from patients with CAPS, unstimulated or after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, were examined for signs of stress and production of IL-1β, IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1Ra) and IL-6 in comparison with monocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unstimulated CAPS monocytes showed mild signs of stress including elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and fragmented mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stress signs were worsened by TLR stimulation and eventually led to protein synthesis inhibition with strong impairment of production of cytokines downstream of IL-1, such as IL-1Ra and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These defects were not detected in monocytes from autoimmune patients and healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The stress state of LPS-stimulated CAPS monocytes and the consequent inhibition of translation are likely to be responsible for the impaired production of IL-1Ra and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deficient secretion of these cytokines coupled with increased IL-1β release explains the severity of the IL-1-related clinical manifestations and the predominant implication of innate immunity in CAPS </plain></SENT>
