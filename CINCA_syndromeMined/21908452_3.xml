<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 39 patients with CAPS, including 5 FCAS, 16 MWS and 18 CINCA syndrome, received anti-IL-1 therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> and 12 with MWS were treated with IL-1Ra (anakinra), 14 patients with MWS with a monoclonal anti-IL-1Î² antibody (canakinumab) and patients with FCAS received IL-1 Trap (rilonacept) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During serial clinical visits serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and MRP8/14 serum levels were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Untreated patients with CAPS had significantly elevated MRP8/14 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In response to treatment there was a significant reduction of MRP8/14 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> (2,830 (range 690 - 8,480) ng/ml to 670 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.001) and MWS patients (anakinra-treated: 4,390 (1790 - 9780) ng/ml to 1,315 ng/ml (p = 0.003); canakinumab-treated: 3,000 (500 - 13060) ng/ml to 630 ng/ml (p=0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in many patients with CAPS, MRP8/14 levels were still elevated compared with healthy individuals, reflecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, canakinumab-treated patients with CAPS showed normalised MRP8/14 levels, suggesting control of phagocyte activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of cellular systems involved in inflammatory cascades of the innate immunity was successfully applied to the IL-1-driven CAPS diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first study illustrating different states of subclinical disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of CAPS depending on the type of anti-IL-1 therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRP8/14 is a sensitive biomarker for monitoring disease activity, status of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and response to IL-1 blockade in patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
