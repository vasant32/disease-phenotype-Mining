<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The model is based on fuzzy theory and uses information provided by international experts through a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been tested in two case studies for a particular type of POPs: brominated flame retardants (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BFRs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first case study is related to the EU-funded AQUATERRA project, with sampling campaigns carried out in two Ebro tributaries in Spain (the Cinca and Vero Rivers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second one, named the BROMACUA project, assessed different aquatic ecosystems in Chile (San Vicente Bay) and Colombia (Santa Marta Marsh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both projects, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BFRs</z:e> under study were polybrominated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ethers</z:chebi> (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the model can be extrapolated to other POPs and to different aquatic ecosystems to provide useful results for decision-makers </plain></SENT>
