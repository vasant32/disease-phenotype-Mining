<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Autoinflammatory diseases constitute a large spectrum of monogenic diseases like <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> or cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) and complex genetic trait diseases such as systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (SoJIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased rate of MEFV mutations has been shown among patients with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>, in populations where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> is frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to search for MEFV mutations in our patients with SoJIA and see whether these mutations had an effect on disease course or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five children with the diagnosis of SoJIA were screened for 12 MEFV mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control data were obtained from a previous study of our centre determining the carrier frequency in Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients were homozygous and three patients were heterozygous for the M694V mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient was a compound heterozygote for the M680I/V726A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous V726A mutation was found in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall mutation frequency of patients was 14.28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This figure had been compared with the previously published rate of disease-causing mutations in this country, which is 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disease-causing mutations were found to be significantly more frequent in the SoJIA patients than the population (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among these, M694V was the leading mutation with a frequency of 10% in SoJIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients carrying MEFV mutations were among the most resistant cases requiring biological therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SoJIA patients had a significantly higher frequency of MEFV mutations but clinical studies with large number of patients are needed to confirm the association of MEFV mutations with SoJIA and its course </plain></SENT>
