<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome (FCAS), a subtype of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS), is a rare, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> that is virtually unknown to healthcare professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this patient survey was to characterize the symptomatology and evaluate the debilitating effects of FCAS on patients' daily lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients included in a disease database consisting of 167 FCAS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) patients were provided an opportunity to voluntarily participate in a cross-sectional market-based survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon assessment of eligibility, individual in-depth phone interviews were conducted by an independent research agency to characterize disease symptomatology, diagnosis, and disease impact on daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients with prior diagnosis of FCAS participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common and recurring symptoms reported were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo>, chills, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of survey participants (90%) reported that they presented with symptoms as newborns or in early childhood - symptoms which became burdensome by school age, with patients reporting recurring symptoms and debilitating disease flares precipitated by environmental exposure to cooling temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To cope with their underlying disease and to try to avoid symptomatic flares, patients reported limiting their work, school, family, and social activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent of survey participants described an impact of the disease on their work, including absenteeism and impaired job advancement; frequently they quit their job as a consequence of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over 95% of survey participants reported that FCAS prevented participation in outdoor activities, while 83% indicated an impact on social activities, including relationships with friends and family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Limitations of this survey include the absence of a validated quality-of-life instrument, lack of correlation with patient medical records, and potential recall and responder bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of participants appears small, but reflects 18% of the known FCAS population in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FCAS causes lifelong debilitating effects that restrict patients' daily lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Poor recognition of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> among healthcare professionals leads to delayed diagnosis and inappropriate or ineffective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Healthcare providers need to be made aware of this serious debilitating disease to enable accurate and timely diagnosis and more compassionate management of this lifelong condition </plain></SENT>
