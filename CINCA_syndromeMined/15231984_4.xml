<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> occurred at 26 months of age with predominantly cutaneous (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042109" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urticarial rash</z:e>) and neurologic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>) symptoms including early bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo>, whereas articular manifestations were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene revealed heterozygosity for a novel missense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A T515C transition led to the replacement of isoleucine by threonine at amino acid position 172 (I172T) in a region of cryopyrin flanking the PYRIN and NACHT domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mutation was not present in the parents or in 11 controls and therefore was considered to be a de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to determine interleukin-6 and soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor superfamily 1B levels in the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations were highly elevated in the CSF, whereas corresponding serum levels remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strong cytokine activation in the CSF corresponded with the neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local activation of intrathecal macrophages may therefore be an important pathogenetic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CSF cytokine levels decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the boy reached the age of 5.5 years, treatment was stopped, and he has remained relapse-free </plain></SENT>
