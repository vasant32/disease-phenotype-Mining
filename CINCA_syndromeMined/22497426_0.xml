<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The age-dependent disease progression requires accelerating diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) in order to start treatment as early as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent, but not obligate symptoms are familial <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, hearing loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The design of further clinical trials should focus on hearing in order to document the long-term effect of anti-interleukin (IL)-1 drugs on hearing preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the otologic features of a genetically defined syndrome causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001730'>progressive hearing loss</z:hpo> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005102'>cochlear degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first study reporting the pretreatment otologic presentation of a selected population with familial MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-center cohort was examined by audiologic and neurotologic methods including pure tone audiograms, vestibular testing, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The audiograms of members of the same family were compared to describe the family-specific risk of hearing loss progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients (aged 3-72 years) belonging to four families with three different mutations of the NLRP3 gene were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (89%, 17/19) demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0008619'>bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss started in the high frequencies and led to profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> in the most severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even in cases of profound hearing loss the vestibular caloric reactivity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of the adults reported intermittent or permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
