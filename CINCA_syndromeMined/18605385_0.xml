<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sampling site corresponded to a point downstream from Monz√≥n, a heavily industrialized town with drainage into the river </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This river has historically been a source of emissions of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> and its metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest levels were found in 1999 and 2000, although the concentrations of organic compounds in sediments and fish have decreased since then </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> in water were below the quantification limit during the period of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average composition of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> isomers measured in sediments and fish showed the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16598">p,p'-DDE</z:chebi>, the product of aerobic degradation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16130">p,p'-DDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations in fish were compared with sediment samples, and high quotients indicate that they are highly bioavailable </plain></SENT>
