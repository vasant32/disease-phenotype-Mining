<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report a new corneal finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) and its subsequent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical chart of a 45-year-old woman with a history of MWS was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She presented with progressive bilateral stromal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> that had been worsening over the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left eye, which had more severe stromal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> and a best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of hand motion, had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> removal with lens implantation, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser trabeculoplasty, and trabeculectomy 2 years previously for open-angle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The right eye had also undergone <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser trabeculoplasty and trabeculectomy and had a BSCVA of 20/100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty in the more severely affected left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine months postoperatively the patient had a BSCVA of 20/40 in the eye that had undergone transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathologic specimen demonstrated a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000491'>keratitis</z:hpo> with focal calcification of Bowman layer, localized Descemet membrane breaks, marked endothelial loss, and pronounced intrastromal epithelioid histiocytes without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this case highlights a new association with MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epithelioid histiocytes have been demonstrated in other parts of the body in patients with MWS including the skin and joints, which is sometimes accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
