<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NLRP3 is an important regulator of caspase-1, the enzyme that processes the immature form of IL-1Î² into the active protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control of NLRP3 has therefore become a focus of research with evidence for redox regulation, ubiquitination and regulation by miRNA-223, kinases and calcium <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> emerging as controllers of NLRP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As our knowledge expands the prospect for precise pharmacological targeting of NLRP3 will improve and could lead to substantial clinical utility </plain></SENT>
