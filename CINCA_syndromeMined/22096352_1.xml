<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CAPS are thought to be driven by excessive production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), through over-activation of the inflammasome by gain of function mutations in the gene encoding cryopyrin (NLRP3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by the remarkable efficacy of IL-1β blockade in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rilonacept (Arcalyst(TM); Regeneron) is the first us Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> and the first in a new line of drugs designed for longer-acting IL-1 blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rilonacept has been associated with a decrease in disease activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the treatment of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical safety and efficacy of rilonacept in CAPS and non-CAPS populations will be summarized in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rilonacept is also beneficial for patients who tolerate injections poorly, due to an extended half-life over the unapproved CAPS treatment, anakinra, requiring weekly rather than daily self-administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other autoinflammatory disorders may also benefit from rilonacept treatment, with clinical trials in progress for systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo> and familial mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
