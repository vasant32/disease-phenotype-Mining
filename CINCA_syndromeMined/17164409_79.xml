<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several autoinflammatory disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> are characterized by mutations in the NALP3/cryopyrin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NALP3 and NALP1 proteins can assemble to inflammasomes that activate caspase-1, resulting in the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine which cells and tissues express NALP1 and NALP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies were developed and their use revealed distinct distribution profiles of NALP1 and NALP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes, monocytes (very weakly), dendritic cells, and B and T cells <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> express NALP1 and NALP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Highest levels of NALP1 are found in T cells and Langerhans cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NALP1 is present in glandular epithelial structures such as stomach, gut, lung, and, surprisingly, in neurons and testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to NALP1, NALP3 shows a more restricted tissue distribution with expression mainly in non-keratinizing epithelia in the oropharynx, esophagus, and ectocervix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NALP3 expression is found in the urothelial layer in the bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, a difference in subcellular distribution between NALP1 and NALP3 is observed because NALP1 is localized mainly in the nucleus, whereas NALP3 is predominantly cytoplasmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that the presence of NALP3 in epithelial cells lining the oral and genital tracts allows the rapid sensing of invading pathogens, thereby triggering an innate immune response </plain></SENT>
