<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Markers of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> response include intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> and extracellular release of reduced cysteine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) are autoinflammatory diseases in which Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) gene mutations lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0008657'>increased IL-1beta secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show in a large cohort of patients that IL-1beta secretion by CAPS monocytes is much faster than that by healthy monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This accelerated kinetics is caused by alterations in the basal redox state, as well as in the redox response to TLR triggering displayed by CAPS monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, unstimulated CAPS monocytes are under a mild <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, with elevated levels of both ROS and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The redox response to LPS is quickened, with early generation of the reducing conditions favoring IL-1beta processing and secretion, and then rapidly exhausted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, secretion of IL-1beta is accelerated, but reaches a plateau much earlier than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibition of the redox response hinders IL-1beta release, confirming the functional link between redox impairment and altered kinetics of secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Monocytes from patients with juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> display <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kinetics of redox response and IL-1beta secretion, excluding a role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the alterations observed in CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that preexisting redox alterations distinct from CAPS monocytes anticipate the pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule-induced generation of the reducing environment favorable to inflammasome activation and IL-1beta secretion </plain></SENT>
