<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three barbels (Barbus graellsii), 30 bleaks (Alburnus alburnus) and 4 sediment samples were collected from four areas of the Cinca River (NE Spain), upstream and downstream of a mercury cell <z:chebi fb="35" ids="23116">chlor</z:chebi>-alkali plant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mercury concentration in sediments downstream of the plant was about 25 times higher than the concentration upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mercury levels in the muscle and liver of barbels downstream of the <z:chebi fb="35" ids="23116">chlor</z:chebi>-alkali plant were 10 and 30 times higher than those upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average mercury concentration in the muscle and liver of barbels downstream of the factory was 1.48 and 1.78mg/kgw.w., with maximal concentrations of 2.43 and 3.64mg/kgw.w, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liver/muscle ratio of mercury was significantly higher in barbels sampled downstream of the factory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bleak showed a similar pattern, with a significantly higher whole-body mercury concentration downstream of the <z:chebi fb="35" ids="23116">chlor</z:chebi>-alkali plant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a progressive decrease in mercury concentration downstream of the impact area was found in bleak, but not in barbel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis showed that fish downstream of the factory had significantly higher prevalence of liver pathologies (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there are no specific histopathological markers of mercury exposure, barbels with the highest Hg levels in the liver also showed the most severe pathologies, and the processes found in these barbels were consistent with the pro-oxidant effect of heavy metals </plain></SENT>
