<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding NALP3 (NLRP3) underlie the cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to report a novel NLRP3 mutation in 2 siblings of Swedish descent in whom symptoms first presented in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutation analysis of NLRP3 was performed on DNA from patients with CAPS and 100 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For assessment of caspase 1 and IL-1beta, blood was collected from patients and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic constructs containing mutant or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> NLRP3 were transduced into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells, followed by assessment of IL-1beta levels in cell supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both siblings carried a novel M299V mutation in NLRP3, which was not present in the control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The samples obtained from the patients displayed increased caspase 1 activity and elevated IL-1beta levels at basal conditions as compared with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells expressing mutated M299V revealed almost 10-fold higher IL-1beta production compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: M299V is an activating mutation in NLRP3 resulting in elevated spontaneous caspase 1 activity and IL-1beta levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The classic CAPS phenotype was lacking in these adult siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whereas one sibling displayed a milder phenotype that has so far responded satisfactorily to oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi> in combination with low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, the inflammatory symptoms in the sibling with the more severe case responded well to IL-1beta blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Understanding the pathogenic mechanism underlying such disorders can be helpful for the physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study reinforces the importance of genetic testing and laboratory investigations in combination with careful phenotypic evaluation for the diagnosis of such patients </plain></SENT>
