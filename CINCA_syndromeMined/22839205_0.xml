<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> appears in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients rapidly after infusion, and is triggered or exacerbated by cold, while its mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the involvement of thermosensitive transient receptor potential channels (TRPA1, TRPM8 and TRPV1) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypersensitivity was investigated in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single intraperitoneal administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (1-10 mg/kg) induced cold but not mechanical hypersensitivity within 2 h in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infusion of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> metabolite, oxalate (1.7 mg/kg), also induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cold hypersensitivity, while another <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-based chemotherapeutic agent, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg), or the non-<z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel (6 mg/kg) failed to induce mechanical or cold hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cold hypersensitivity was abolished by the TRPA1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> HC-030031 (100 mg/kg) and by TRPA1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nocifensive behaviors evoked by intraplantar injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30361">allyl</z:chebi>-isothiocyanate (AITC; TRPA1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) were significantly enhanced in mice treated for 2 h with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (1-10 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner, while <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> (TRPV1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>)-evoked nocifensive behaviors were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Menthol (TRPM8/TRPA1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>)-evoked nocifensive-like behaviors were also enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> pretreatment, which were inhibited by TRPA1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, oxalate enhanced, but neither <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> nor paclitaxel affected AITC-evoked nocifensive behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of cultured mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (30-300 μM) for 1, 2, or 4 h significantly increased the number of AITC-sensitive neurons in a concentration-dependent manner whereas there was no change in the number of menthol- or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-sensitive neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that a brief treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> or its metabolite oxalate is sufficient to enhance the responsiveness of TRPA1 but not that of TRPM8 and TRPV1 expressed by DRG neurons, which may contribute to the characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
