<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) is a rare inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> associated with overproduction of interleukin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab is a human anti-interleukin-1beta monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In part 1, 35 patients received 150 mg of canakinumab subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with a complete response to treatment entered part 2 and were randomly assigned to receive either 150 mg of canakinumab or placebo every 8 weeks for up to 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the completion of part 2 or at the time of relapse, whichever occurred first, patients proceeded to part 3 and received at least two more doses of canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated therapeutic responses using disease-activity scores and analysis of levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In part 1 of the study, 34 of the 35 patients (97%) had a complete response to canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 31 entered part 2, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients receiving canakinumab remained in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease flares occurred in 13 of the 16 patients (81%) receiving placebo (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of part 2, median CRP and SAA values were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (&lt;10 mg per liter for both measures) in patients receiving canakinumab but were elevated in those receiving placebo (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 patients, 28 (90%) completed part 3 in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In part 2, the incidence of suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was greater in the canakinumab group than in the placebo group (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two serious adverse events occurred during treatment with canakinumab: one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urosepsis</z:e> and an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with subcutaneous canakinumab once every 8 weeks was associated with a rapid remission of symptoms in most patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
