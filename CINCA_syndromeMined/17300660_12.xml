<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They appear to represent a continuum of one disease characterized by IL-1-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until recently, these conditions have been difficult to treat; however, with the advent of IL-1-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> therapy, many reports of successful treatment of patients with these autoinflammatory diseases have emerged in the past 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe an 8-year-old girl, diagnosed with Familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome, confirmed by presence of a novel CIAS1 mutation, who was refractory to symptomatic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As frequent attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> had a debilitating effect on the child's lifestyle, a trial of IL-1-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (anakinra) was instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dramatic sustained clinical improvement was evident within days and serum amyloid and C-reactive protein levels normalized within a month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although several authors have reported successful use of this agent in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome, we believe ours is the first report of successful treatment with anakinra in a young child with familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome </plain></SENT>
