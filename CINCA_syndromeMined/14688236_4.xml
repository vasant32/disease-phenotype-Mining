<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Coculture of mouse bone marrow-derived immature mast cells (BMMC) with Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) promotes morphological and functional maturation toward a connective tissue mast cell (CTMC)-like phenotype, which is accompanied by increased expression of several unique genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the molecular identification of one of them, mast cell maturation-associated inducible gene (MMIG)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MMIG-1 cDNA encodes a 117-kDa cytosolic protein that comprises an N-terminal PYRIN domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain, and nine C-terminal leucine-rich repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMIG-1 shows &gt;85% sequence similarity to human cryopyrin/PYPAF1, a causal gene for familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMIG-1 was distributed in the cytosol of CTMC-like differentiated BMMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMIG-1 underwent alternative splicing in the leucine-rich repeats and each variant was induced differently in BMMC during coculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its expression was increased in the ears of mice with experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, MMIG-1, a likely mouse PYPAF1 ortholog, may play a role in mast cell-directed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
