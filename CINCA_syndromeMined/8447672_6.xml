<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Release of a chymotrypsinlike substance has been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no effective treatment has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: Eight cases from a large family pedigree are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three members showed a very favorable response in their cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>, when treated with stanozolol; the response was reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of an early lesion in one case revealed evidence of mast cell degranulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The biochemical observations are probably secondary epiphenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correction of a deficiency of an inhibitory protein is a possible mechanism of action of stanozolol as in hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
