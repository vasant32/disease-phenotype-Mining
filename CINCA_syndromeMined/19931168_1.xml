<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26374">pterins</z:chebi> have been reported as mediating immunologic functions in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, but to date studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26374">pterin</z:chebi> cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) values and cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> have been lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 2-year-old child was affected with a severe atypical form of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e>, suspected based on the analysis of neopterin in CSF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neopterin was the most altered indicator over the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Child neurologists should be on the alert when unexplained neurologic signs appear, giving consideration to the possibility of inflammatory or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present case demonstrates the clinical utility of measurement of CSF neopterin levels in screening for these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath>, especially when neurologic symptoms are associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results on routine CSF tests </plain></SENT>
