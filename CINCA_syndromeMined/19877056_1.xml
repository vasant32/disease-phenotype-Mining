<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HPFs include familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperimmunoglobulinemia</z:e> D with periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HIDS</z:e>), TNF receptor-associated syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e>), and cryopyrinopathies, which are attributable to mutations of the MEFV, MVK, TNFRSF1A, and CIAS1 genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in many patients, the mutated gene has not been determined; therefore, the condition in these patients with an HPF-like clinical picture is referred to as idiopathic periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess involvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (XIAP), which plays a role in caspase inhibition and NF-kappaB signaling, both of which are processes that influence the development of inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The XIAP gene (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo>) was sequenced in 87 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>, 46 patients with HPF (13 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HIDS</z:e>, 17 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e>, and 16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>), and 182 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of different alleles was evaluated by sequencing XIAP-specific complementary DNA mini-libraries and by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional effect of XIAP on caspase 9 activity was assessed by a fluorimetric assay, and cytokine secretion was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sequencing disclosed a 1268A&gt;C variation that caused a Q423P amino acid substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of 423Q-homozygous female patients and 423Q-hemizygous male patients was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> group than in the control group (69% versus 51%; odds ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.23-3.87, P = 0.007), whereas no significant difference was detected in the HPF group (59%) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In primary lymphocytes and transfected cell lines, 423Q, as compared with 423P, was associated with higher XIAP protein and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression and lower caspase 9 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-activated monocytes, 423Q was associated with higher secretion of TNFalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 423Q is a predisposing factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> development, possibly through its influence on monocyte function </plain></SENT>
