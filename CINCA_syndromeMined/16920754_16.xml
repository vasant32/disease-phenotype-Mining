<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical and genetic features of 12 unrelated Italian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> are described, focusing on the possible influence of the presence of CIAS1/cryopyrin mutations on the phenotype of the disease and on its prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical features of 12 Italian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA of the patients was sequenced using specific primers for CIAS1 and ASC genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our patients shared typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> characteristics and, sometimes, remarkable perinatal events, peculiar of CIAS1-mutated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients carried CIAS1 missense mutation, localized within the nucleotide binding domain of cryopyrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four previously described mutations and three new heterozygous CIAS1 missense mutations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ASC gene, encoding for a direct interactor of cryopyrin, was not mutated in Italian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we reported the efficacy and safety of anti-IL1 therapy (Anakinra) in seven patients with a particularly severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite some common signs-used as syndrome hallmarks-we observed a high variability in symptoms, genetic results and outcomes in Italian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast with other authors, we cannot find out any correlation between mutations in CIAS1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> severity, but we underlined the concomitance of perinatal events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> only in CIAS1 mutated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, we confirmed the efficacy of Anakinra treatment, both in CIAS1-mutated and non-mutated patients </plain></SENT>
