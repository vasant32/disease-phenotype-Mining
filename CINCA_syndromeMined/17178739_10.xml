<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Describe four generations (11 members) of a family with a cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (CAPS), including joint destruction, associated with a CIAS1-gene mutation and good responses to anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In addition to detailed questioning and physical examination, six family members underwent haematological, immunological and biochemical testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene was sequenced in search of a mutation in the 1q44 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During childhood or adolescence, four family members developed different combinations of the following CAPS manifestations: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> (3/4); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (4/4) with joint destruction for two of them; <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> (cerebral demyelinization, 2/4), cutaneous (livedo and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>, 3/4) and eye lesions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100534'>episcleritis</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e>, 4/4); IgA <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinaemia</z:hpo> (4/4) and inflammatory syndrome (3/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of six family members' CIAS1-gene exon 3 identified a heterozygous mutation, c.1043C &gt; T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pertinently, this CAPS is distinct from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurological cutaneous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> syndrome/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal onset</z:hpo> multisystemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS), which also result from exon 3 mutations in this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this family did not have the usual neurological manifestations, typical morphological features and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> of MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe a previously unreported form of CAPS with atypical neurological signs, joint destruction and livedo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation extends the clinical spectrum associated with CIAS1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anakinra, an interleukin-1-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, prescribed to two family members, was highly effective </plain></SENT>
