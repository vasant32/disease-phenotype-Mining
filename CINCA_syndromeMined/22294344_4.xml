<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of long-term treatment has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term effect of anakinra on clinical and laboratory outcomes and safety in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 26 NOMID patients ages 0.80-42.17 years who were followed up at the NIH and treated with anakinra 1-5 mg/kg/day for at least 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed using daily diaries, questionnaires, and C-reactive protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, hearing, vision, and safety were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sustained improvements in diary scores, parent's/patient's and physician's global scores of disease activity, parent's/patient's pain scores, and inflammatory markers were observed (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.001 at 36 and 60 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 36 and 60 months, <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>CNS inflammation</z:mp> was suppressed, with decreased cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell counts (P=0.0026 and P=0.0076, respectively), albumin levels, and opening pressures (P=0.0012 and P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients showed stable or improved hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cochlear enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging correlated with continued hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity and peripheral vision were stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low optic nerve size correlated with poor visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bony lesions progressed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that anakinra provides sustained efficacy in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> for up to 5 years, with the requirement of dose escalation </plain></SENT>
