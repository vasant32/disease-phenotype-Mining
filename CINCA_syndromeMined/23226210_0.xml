<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> patients present with systemic and organ-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the skin, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and bone, and respond dramatically to treatment with IL-1 blocking agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the cellular infiltrates and transcriptome of skin biopsies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> (n = 14) before treatment (lesional (LS) and non-lesional (pre-NL) skin) and after treatment (post-NL) with the IL-1 blocker anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, Kineret®, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, SOBI), to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin (n = 5) to assess tissue responses in the context of untreated and treated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abundant neutrophils distinguish LS skin from pre-NL and post-NL skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD11c(+) dermal dendritic cells and CD163(+) macrophages expressed activated caspase-1 and are a likely source of cutaneous IL-1 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with anakinra led to the disappearance of neutrophils, but CD3(+) T cells and HLA-DR(+) cells remained elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the upregulated genes IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-17A, CCL20, and the neutrophil defensins DEFA1 and DEFA3 were differentially regulated in LS tissues (compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Important significantly downregulated pathways in LS skin included IL-1R/TLR signaling, type I and II cytokine receptor signaling, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, and antigen presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differential expression and regulation of microRNAs and pathways involved in post-transcriptional modification were suggestive of epigenetic modification in the chronically inflamed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the dysregulated genes and pathways suggest extensive "adaptive" mechanisms to control <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and maintain tissue homeostasis, likely triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> IL-1 release in the skin of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> </plain></SENT>
