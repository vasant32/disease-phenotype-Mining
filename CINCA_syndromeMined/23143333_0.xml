<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding NLRP3 cause a spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases known as cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NLRP3 is a key component of one of several distinct cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes (inflammasomes) that mediate the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by activating caspase-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although several models for inflammasome activation, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> efflux, generation of reactive oxygen species and lysosomal destabilization, have been proposed, the precise molecular mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as the mechanism by which CAPS-associated mutations activate NLRP3, remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the murine calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, mediated by increased intracellular Ca(2+) and decreased cellular cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> (cAMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) or other CASR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in the absence of exogenous ATP, whereas knockdown of CASR reduces inflammasome activation in response to known NLRP3 activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASR activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through phospholipase C, which catalyses <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-1,4,5-trisphosphate production and thereby induces release of Ca(2+) from endoplasmic reticulum stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased cytoplasmic Ca(2+) promotes the assembly of inflammasome components, and intracellular Ca(2+) is required for spontaneous inflammasome activity in cells from patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CASR stimulation also results in reduced intracellular cAMP, which independently activates the NLRP3 inflammasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>cAMP binds to NLRP3 directly to inhibit inflammasome assembly, and downregulation of cAMP relieves this inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The binding affinity of cAMP for CAPS-associated mutant NLRP3 is substantially lower than for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> NLRP3, and the uncontrolled mature IL-1β production from CAPS patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells is attenuated by increasing cAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate that Ca(2+) and cAMP are two key molecular regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome that have critical roles in the molecular pathogenesis of CAPS </plain></SENT>
