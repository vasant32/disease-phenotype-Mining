<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no clear response to standard therapies, including human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (anakinra) and soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor (etanercept) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient finally had a partial clinical response (reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>) and complete laboratory response (improved C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A levels) to humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (MRA), but died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> 2 months after initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
