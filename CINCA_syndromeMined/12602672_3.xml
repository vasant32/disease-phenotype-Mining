<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations responsible for FCAS were identified in a novel gene (CIAS1), making it possible to confirm the diagnosis in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We present a summary of clinical data from a large family with FCAS to further define the characteristics of the disorder and to validate previously proposed clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 73 participants were evaluated by interview and questionnaire, including 36 affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses from the questionnaire were analyzed and comparisons of proportions were made using the Z test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated and genotyping was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Affected haplotypes (genotype patterns) were identified and used to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the CIAS1 gene was performed in selected patients to confirm the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>/chills, joint complaints, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and thirst were not significantly different from previously reported proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was statistically significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> with alpha = 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean temperature required to produce symptoms was 22 degrees C, and the average earliest <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms after exposure was 1.5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Applying the proposed clinical criteria, 41% of affected subjects met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six criteria, 90% met five criteria, and 100% met four criteria for FCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the unaffected subjects met more than two criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Using a threshold of 4 of 6 clinical criteria, the data support the diagnostic validity of the proposed clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
