<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The systemic autoinflammatory disorders (SAID) share many clinical manifestations, albeit with variable patterns, intensity and frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A common definition of disease activity would be rational and useful in the management of these lifelong diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, standardised disease activity scores are required for the assessment of new therapies in constant development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop preliminary activity scores for familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> kinase deficiency, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-1-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> and cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted using two well-recognised consensus formation methods: the Delphi technique and the nominal group technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results from a two-step survey and data from parent/patient interviews were used as preliminary data to develop the agenda for a consensus conference to build a provisional scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24 of 65 experts in SAID from 20 countries answered the web questionnaire and 16 attended the consensus conference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was consensus agreement to develop separate activity scores for each disease but with a common format based on patient diaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> and disease-specific clinical variables were scored according to their severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A final score was generated by summing the score of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the variables divided by the number of days over which the diary was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Scores varied from 0 to 16 (0-13 in CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These scores were developed for the purpose of clinical studies but could be used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using widely recognised consensus formation techniques, preliminary scores were obtained to measure disease activity in four main SAID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further prospective validation study of this instrument will follow </plain></SENT>
