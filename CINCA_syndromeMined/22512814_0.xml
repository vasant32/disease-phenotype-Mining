<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) is a rare autoinflammatory disorder associated with NLRP3 gene mutations, which cause excessive caspase-1 activation and processing of interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether MWS disease may be associated with impaired fertility in male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male MWS patients with NLRP3 mutations followed in our tertiary center for inherited autoinflammatory diseases were reviewed retrospectively for data indicating fertility problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of 9 patients were unable to have children despite regular sexual activity during at least 2 years; 3 succeeded in having children through in vitro fertilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>Infertility</z:hpo> was the main reason for divorce in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spermiogram analyses were available in 8 of the 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002687'>Oligozoospermia</z:mp> was observed in 5 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, treatment with IL-1-targeting drugs for 6 and 12 months, respectively, had a moderate or no effect on spermatozoa counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels were low and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased spermatozoa counts in 1 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MWS may be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> in male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, sexual health and fertility should be assessed systematically in adolescent and adult male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are required to establish the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> in male MWS patients, to understand when <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> occurs in the disease natural history, and, finally, to investigate whether early management with IL-1-targeting drugs, or <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> treatment or early sperm cryo-conservation may help to allow procreation </plain></SENT>
