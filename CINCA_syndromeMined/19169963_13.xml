<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab has promising clinical safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and demonstrated potential for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) and possibly for other complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, systemic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (SoJIA), COPD disease and ocular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently in phase III clinical development, canakinumab was recently granted EU and US Orphan Drug status for SoJIA and CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early clinical trials have established the administration of canakinumab every 2 weeks to be safe and effective, offering a considerable advantage over the existing treatment with the human IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> anakinra, which must be injected daily and which is often poorly tolerated by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The availability of more than one IL-1 targeting biological agent is undoubtedly advantageous, not only for patients and clinicians, but also for the elucidation of disease mechanisms </plain></SENT>
