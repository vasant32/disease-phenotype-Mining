<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the CIAS1 gene, which encodes a member of the NALP (NACHT-, LRR-, and PYD-containing proteins) family, the cryopyrin/NALP3/PYPAF1 protein, expressed primarily in phagocytic cells, were recently found to be associated with a spectrum of autoinflammatory disorders </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 3-dimensional model of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of cryopyrin suggested that this molecule is structurally and functionally similar to members of the AAA+ protein family of ATPases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to this model, most of the mutations known to affect residues of the NBD are clustered on one side of this domain in a region predicted to participate in intermolecular contacts, suggesting that this model is likely to be biologically relevant and that defects in nucleotide binding, nucleotide hydrolysis, or protein oligomerization may lead to the functional dysregulation of cryopyrin in the MWS, FCU, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> disorders </plain></SENT>
