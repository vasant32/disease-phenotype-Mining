<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize patients according to the disease severity of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five Japanese patients with four kinds of gene variations in NLRP3 were found and diagnosed as CAPS or juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two mutations in NLRP3, Y563N and E688K, found in CAPS patients exhibit significant positive activities in the nuclear factor-κB reporter gene assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased serum interleukin (IL)-18 levels were only observed in severe cases of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In mild cases of CAPS, the serum IL-18 levels were not increased, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>-enhanced IL-1β and IL-18 production levels by their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This series of case reports suggests that a combination of in vitro assays could be a useful tool for the diagnosis and characterization of the disease severity of CAPS </plain></SENT>
