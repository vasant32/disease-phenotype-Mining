<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fish and sediments from four places along the Spanish River Cinca were analyzed for polybrominated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ethers</z:chebi> (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The samples were collected up- and downstream from Monz√≥n, a heavily industrialized town draining to the river </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBDEs and HBCD were found in sediments at levels ranging from 2 to 42 ng/g dry weight and from not detected (nd) to 514 ng/g dry weight, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three fish samples (Barbus graellsi) collected at the same places were also analyzed, showing levels from nd to 446 ng/g wet weight for PBDEs and from nd to 1172 ng/g wet weight for HBCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lowest values for both sediment and fish samples were found upstream of the industry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 40 congeners (from mono- to deca-BDEs) included in the analytical work, 8 PBDE congeners were detected in river sediments, whereas 17 different PBDEs were found in fish samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Large fish-to-sediment ratios for these brominated compounds indicate that they are highly bioavailable, with the exception of deca-BDE which was only detected in sediment samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of PBDEs and HBCD were slightly higher in muscle tissues than in liver samples obtained from the same specimen of fish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PBDE and HBCD concentrations are correlated with fish length indicating the bioaccumulation of these contaminants </plain></SENT>
