<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Since 2004, 20 patients with CAPS were enrolled in a common registry from different Italian Centers of Pediatric Rheumatology; 14 patients were treated with Anakinra in an open fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both treated and untreated patients were routinely followed according to standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-PF 50) was used to assess the health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 37.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients, a complete and persistent control of the inflammatory manifestations was observed with no further progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At enrollment in the registry, patients showed a poorer health-related quality of life than healthy children in both physical and the psychosocial summary scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was associated with a dramatic and sustained amelioration of a variety of measures of poor quality of life, particularly in those concerning the global health perception, bodily pain-discomfort, and other physical domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term IL-1 blockade produces a significant and persistent improvement in the clinical manifestations associated with the disease and on the overall quality of life </plain></SENT>
