<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed the immune responses of gene-targeted mice carrying a mutation in the Nlrp3 gene equivalent to the human mutation associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from such mice produced massive amounts of IL-1beta upon stimulation with microbial stimuli in the absence of ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was likely due to a diminished inflammasome activation threshold that allowed a response to the small amount of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Nlrp3 gene-targeted mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011123'>skin inflammation</z:hpo> characterized by neutrophil infiltration and a Th17 cytokine-dominant response, which originated from hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of Nlrp3 gene-targeted mice resulted from excess IL-1beta production from APCs, which augmented Th17 cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the NLRP3 mutation leads to inflammasome hyperactivation and consequently Th17 cell-dominant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> in autoinflammation </plain></SENT>
