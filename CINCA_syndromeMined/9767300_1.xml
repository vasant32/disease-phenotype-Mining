<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> were non-pruritic, maculopapular, erythematous eruptions and were neither urticarial nor angioedematous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ice-cube test was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory examinations showed marked leucocytosis during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical features, histological findings and laboratory data, although these symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, the most likely diagnosis was familial polymorphous cold eruption, which has also been referred to as familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 6 were significantly elevated during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack after cold exposure, suggesting that both cytokines played important parts in the development of her condition </plain></SENT>
