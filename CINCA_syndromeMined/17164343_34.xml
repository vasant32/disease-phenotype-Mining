<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIAS1 encodes cryopyrin, a protein that localizes to the cytosol and functions as pattern recognition receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cryopyrin also participates in nuclear factor-kappaB regulation and caspase-1-mediated maturation of interleukin 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that disease-associated mutations in CIAS1 induced rapid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 monocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The features of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, including 7-AAD staining, the presence of cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and early membrane damage resulting in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) release, indicated that it was more likely to be <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and was effectively blocked with the cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA-074-Me </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CA-074-Me also suppressed induced by disease-associated mutation lysosomal leakage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36704">R837</z:chebi>, a recently identified activator of cryopyrin-associated inflammasomes, induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> CIAS1-transfected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that monocytes undergo rapid cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a cathepsin B-dependent manner upon activation of cryopyrin, which is also a specific phenomenon induced by disease-associated mutation of CIAS1 </plain></SENT>
