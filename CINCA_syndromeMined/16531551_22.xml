<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1beta, is believed to have a fundamental role in their pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: The case is described of a 59 year old white woman who presented with increasingly severe MWS-type features over a 15 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response to interleukin 1beta inhibition with anakinra was dramatic, including a reduction in intracranial pressure with associated auditory improvement, as demonstrated by serial audiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The confirmed improvement in hearing after initiation of interleukin 1 receptor antagonism corroborates previous reports that specific blockade of this single cytokine reverses most of the symptoms of this group of CIAS1/NALP3 related autoinflammatory conditions, including the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>sensorineural deafness</z:hpo>, which has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
