<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, conventional sequencing analyses detect true disease-causing mutations in only approximately 55-60% of patients, which suggests the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook the current study to assess the presence of somatic, nongermline NLRP3 mutations in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data, laboratory results, and information on treatment outcomes were gathered through direct interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exhaustive genetic studies, including Sanger method sequencing, subcloning, restriction fragment length polymorphism assay, and pyrosequencing, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> was diagnosed based on clinical features (early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, knee <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo>, and dysmorphic features) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient has exhibited a successful response to anakinra within the last 28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of NLRP3 identified a novel heterozygous variant (p.D303H) that was detected in approximately 30-38% of circulating leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of this variant in healthy controls and in the patient's parents suggested a de novo true disease-causing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses showed that this novel mutation was present in both leukocyte subpopulations and epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings identify the novel p.D303H NLRP3 variant in a Spanish patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> as a new disease-causing mutation, which was detected as a somatic, nongermline mutation in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data provide new insight into the role of low-level mosaicism in NLRP3 as the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
