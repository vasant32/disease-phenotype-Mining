<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of activation and regulation of the cryopyrin signaling pathway remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that co-expression of cryopyrin with its binding partner, ASC, induced both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This signaling was mimicked by oligomerization of ASC, suggesting that cryopyrin activates downstream targets as reported for other Nod family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, pyrin, the product of the familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> gene, inhibited cryopyrin-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and NF-kappaB activation by disrupting the cryopyrin-ASC interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence for a cryopyrin signaling pathway activated through the induced proximity of ASC, which is negatively regulated by pyrin </plain></SENT>
