<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to characterize NLRP12 mutations in patients with autoinflammatory syndromes, particularly a novel missense mutation, p.D294E, affecting a protein sequence crucial for ATP binding, which was identified in a Caucasian family with familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome in some family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients were tested for NLRP12 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Caucasian family with the p.D294E missense mutation of NLRP12 in some family members was clinically characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis of the effects of the mutation on NF-κB activity was performed in HEK 293 cells after cotransfection of the cells with a luciferase NF-κB-responsive element and mutant or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) NLRP12 expression plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NF-κB activity was also evaluated 24 hours after stimulation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α in monocytes from individual family members carrying the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> systems in patient and healthy donor monocytes, under resting conditions and after stimulation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the family assessed, the p.D294E mutation segregated in association with a particular sensitivity to cold exposure (especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>), but not always with an inflammatory phenotype (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042109" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urticarial rash</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the mutant protein maintained the same inhibitory activity as that shown by WT NLRP12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistently, NLRP12-mutated monocytes showed neither increased levels of p65-induced NF-κB activity nor higher secretion of IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the kinetics of PAMP-induced IL-1β secretion were significantly accelerated, and high production of ROS and up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> systems were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even with a variable range of associated manifestations, the extreme sensitivity to cold represents the main clinical hallmark in an individual carrying the p.D294E mutation of the NLRP12 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although regulation of NF-κB activity is not affected in patients, redox alterations and accelerated secretion of IL-1β are associated with this mild autoinflammatory phenotype </plain></SENT>
