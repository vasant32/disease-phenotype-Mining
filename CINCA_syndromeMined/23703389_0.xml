<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It leads to production of proinflammatory cytokine productions such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We and others demonstrated that an induction of activated NLRP3 also induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the characteristics and mechanisms of the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and its involvement in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we established cell lines in which NLRP3 was induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> using a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-inducible expression (Tet-on) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this system, the expression of NLRP3 mutants in cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) patients was sufficient for the induction of necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> stimulation or generation of mature IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that CA074-Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, blocked cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before oligomerization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), whereas Z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, blocked the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after the oligomerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Silencing of the ASC gene (Pycard) by small hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> treatment inhibited the NLRP3 mutant-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but silencing of the caspase-1 gene (Casp1) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicated that ASC was indispensable for NLRP3-mediated programmed necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and that this type of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was distinct from 'pyroptosis', which requires caspase-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrated in an in vivo model that the programmed necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by activated NLRP3 could cause neutrophil infiltration, indicating a possible role of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in neutrophil infiltration of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in CAPS patients </plain></SENT>
