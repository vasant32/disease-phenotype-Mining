<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> is a rare, autosomally dominant disease of interest to physicians treating urticarial-type diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe two patients, a father and daughter with the characteristics of this disease and review the features that differentiate it from other cold-induced syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both patients underwent a cold room challenge, a lesional skin biopsy, and an ice-cube test, P-K test and extensive laboratory studies pre- and post-cold-room challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A careful history revealed winter outbreaks of erythematous, nonpruritic lesions occurring hours after cold air exposure since early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic symptoms included burning, chills, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> rather than the anaphylactic symptoms associated with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticarias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cold room challenge induced "non-urticarial" lesions after a delay of one-half to two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesional biopsy demonstrated polymorphonuclear infiltration with increased eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ice-cube tests and P-K tests were negative, and laboratory studies were remarkable only for a rise in leukocytes and erythrocytic sedimentation rate after positive challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal serum proteins were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> with distinct characteristics that distinguish it from acquired cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticarias</z:hpo> and other cold-induced syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, lesions occur with a delay after exposure to cold air and are not urticarial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anaphylactic symptoms do not occur and abnormal serum proteins are not found </plain></SENT>
