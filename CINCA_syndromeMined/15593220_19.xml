<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the involvement of the CIAS1/PYPAF1/NALP3 gene in 7 unrelated Spanish families with recurrent autoinflammatory diseases characterized by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042109" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urticarial rash</z:e>, in whom a clinical diagnosis of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical symptoms, results of laboratory analyses, and data on previous treatments in members of the 7 families were recorded on a questionnaire specific for hereditary autoinflammatory diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> coding regions and intronic flanking boundaries of the CIAS1/PYPAF1/NALP3 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five different missense mutations, including 2 de novo and 1 previously unreported mutation (R488K), were identified in exon 3 of the CIAS1/PYPAF1/NALP3 gene in 5 of the 7 affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expanded genetic analysis among the healthy individuals identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> in 2 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in 2 of the 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>) syndrome/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal-onset</z:hpo> multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical data suggested a diagnosis of familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome in 3 families, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> syndrome in 3 others, and a possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e>, whereas mutational analysis showed different CIAS1/PYPAF1/NALP3 missense mutations in 5 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with a common molecular basis of these diseases and highlights the phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among CIAS1/PYPAF1/NALP3 gene-associated syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The previously unreported mutation and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> found in 2 families expand the genetic basis underlying these autoinflammatory syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings should alert clinicians to the possible genetic basis of these conditions, even in the absence of a family history, in their attempts to establish an accurate diagnosis and the optimal therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
