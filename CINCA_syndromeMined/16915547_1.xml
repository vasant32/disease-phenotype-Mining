<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some months ago a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) had been made and confirmed by genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mother had developed partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her daughter had been suffering mainly from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> at least once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>THERAPY: Because of the established role of interleukin (IL)-1 in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> and some positive case reports, we decided to treat these patients with the IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients reported a great success of this treatment with virtually complete absence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MWS-associated symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Therapy of MWS with anakinra seems to be highly efficacious for several clinical manifestations of this disease, including laboratory markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is possible that organ destruction may be prevented by this medication </plain></SENT>
