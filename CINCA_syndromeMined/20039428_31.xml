<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>Neonatal-onset</z:hpo> multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e>) is the most severe phenotype, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, articular manifestations, and neurologic and neurosensory involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAPS are caused by mutations in CIAS1, the gene encoding NLRP3, which plays a critical role in interleukin-1 (IL-1) processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, has been shown to be an effective treatment; however, data on long-term efficacy and safety have been sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of anakinra treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> patients referred to 2 centers, who had started anakinra treatment before June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> who had been treated with anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients' ages at the time anakinra treatment was initiated ranged from 3 months to 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had been followed up for 26-42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sustained efficacy in the treatment of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and, in some cases, neurologic involvement and growth parameters, was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dosage of anakinra required for efficacy ranged from 1 to 3 mg/kg/day in the 8 oldest patients and from 6 to 10 mg/kg/day in the 2 youngest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Residual central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> persisted in some patients, especially if there had been a delay in diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> persisted in cases in which it was present at treatment initiation, but no new lesions developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adverse events consisted of mild injection-site reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that anakinra treatment is effective over the long term in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CINCA">CINCA syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, treatment has to be initiated before irreversible lesions develop, and, particularly in very young patients, dosage adjustment is required </plain></SENT>
