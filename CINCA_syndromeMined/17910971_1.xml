<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Cinca River is a tributary of Ebro River in the NE of Spain which receives input from different activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most important is related to an industry where <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> is used as an intermediate in the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34692">dicofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> contamination along the Cinca River </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sampling sites were selected up- and downstream from this industry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sediments and fishes (59 bleaks (Alburnus alburnus) and 23 barbels (Barbus graellsi)) were collected in 2002 and analyzed using a new and rapid selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> and its metabolites were found in sediments and fishes at levels ranging from 9 to 94microg kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.) and from not detected to 2098microg kg(-1) wet weight (w.w.), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest values corresponded to samples collected just downstream the industry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty kilometers downstream from the factory, levels were clearly lower, showing a weakening of the impact. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16598">p,p'-DDE</z:chebi> isomer comprised up to 50% and 70% of total <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> measured in sediment and fish, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared with values obtained in a previous study in 1999, a generalized drop of the levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> matrixes (77-97%), was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No meaningful differences were found between the two fish species studied neither between the two tissues (muscle and liver) analyzed </plain></SENT>
