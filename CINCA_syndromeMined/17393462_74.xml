<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The cryopyrinopathies are a group of rare autoinflammatory disorders that are caused by mutations in CIAS1, encoding the cryopyrin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, cryopyrin mutations are found only in 50% of patients with clinically diagnosed cryopyrinopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the structural effect of disease-causing mutations on cryopyrin, in order to gain better understanding of the impact of disease-associated mutations on protein function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested for CIAS1 mutations in 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal-onset</z:hpo> multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome, 12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS), 18 with familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), and 3 probands with MWS/FCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subset of mutation-negative patients, we screened for mutations in proteins that are either homologous to cryopyrin or involved in the caspase 1/interleukin-1beta signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CIAS1 and other candidate genes were sequenced, models of cryopyrin domains were constructed using structurally homologous proteins as templates, and disease-causing mutations were mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were mutation positive, and 7 novel mutations, V262A, C259W, L264F, V351L, F443L, F523C, and Y563N, were found in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations in any candidate genes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most mutations mapped to an inner surface of the hexameric ring in the cryopyrin model, consistent with the hypothesis that the mutations disrupt a closed form of cryopyrin, thus potentiating inflammasome assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease-causing mutations correlated with disease severity only for a subset of known mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our modeling provides insight into potential molecular mechanisms by which cryopyrin mutations can inappropriately activate an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant number of patients who are clinically diagnosed as having cryopyrinopathies do not have identifiable disease-associated mutations </plain></SENT>
