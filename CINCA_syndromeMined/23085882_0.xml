<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This autoinflammatory disease develops in the neonatal period or early childhood, with various inflammatory symptoms occurring repeatedly throughout the patient's lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is caused by abnormality of the NLRP3 protein which mediates the intracellular signal transduction mechanism of inflammatory processes, resulting in continuous overproduction of interleukin (IL)-1β, which induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and progressive tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Definitive diagnosis of CAPS is difficult, and treatment has also been difficult because of a lack of effective medications in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies of human anti-human IL-1β monoclonal antibody (canakinumab) treatment were conducted in Japan, and approval was granted for therapeutic use of canakinumab for CAPS in September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar to other biological drugs, canakinumab is clinically highly effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, sufficient attention to the method of use and adverse drug reactions is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This guidance describes the use of canakinumab in Japan for CAPS in relation to exclusion criteria, method of use, evaluation criteria, and adverse drug reactions </plain></SENT>
