<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> is a life-threatening complication of the hereditary periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes (HPFS), which are otherwise often compatible with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the characteristics, presentation, natural history, and response to treatment in 46 patients who had been referred for evaluation at the UK National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>Amyloidosis</z:hpo> Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Disease activity was monitored by serial measurement of serum amyloid A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal function was assessed by measurement of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and albumin levels, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> from 24-hour urine collections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amyloid load was measured by serum amyloid P scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, 12 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e>, 6 patients had cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e>, and 4 patients had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> kinase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of HPFS was 5 years; median age at presentation with AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> was 38 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of an HPFS had not been considered prior to presentation with AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in 23 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (24%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal failure</z:hpo> (ESRF) at presentation; of these, 3 had received transplants prior to referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A further 13 patients developed ESRF over the followup period, with 10 undergoing renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression to ESRF from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> was 3.3 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2-8), with a median time to transplant of 4 years (IQR 3-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (24%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival in the entire cohort was 19 years from diagnosis of AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 37 patients who were treated successfully, or in whom at least partial suppression of the underlying HPFS was achieved, 17 (46%) showed amyloid regression, 14 (38%) showed a stable amyloid load, and 2 (5%) showed increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> over the followup period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> remains a challenging and serious late complication of HPFS; however, outcomes are excellent when HPFS is diagnosed early enough to allow effective treatment, thus preventing or retarding further <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> and organ damage </plain></SENT>
