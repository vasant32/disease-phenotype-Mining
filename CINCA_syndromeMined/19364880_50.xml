<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The investigation of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> is hampered by the fact that it is virtually undetectable in human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that by administering the anti-human IL-1beta antibody canakinumab (ACZ885) to humans, the resulting formation of IL-1beta-antibody complexes allowed the detection of in vivo-produced IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A two-compartment mathematical model was generated that predicted a constitutive production rate of 6 ng/d IL-1beta in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS), a rare monogenetic disease driven by uncontrolled caspase-1 activity and IL-1 production, produced a mean of 31 ng/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with canakinumab not only induced long-lasting complete clinical response but also reduced the production rate of IL-1beta to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels within 8 wk of treatment, suggesting that IL-1beta production in these patients was mainly IL-1beta driven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model further indicated that IL-1beta is the only cytokine driving disease severity and duration of response to canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correction for natural IL-1 antagonists was not required to fit the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, the study allowed new insights into the production and regulation of IL-1beta in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also indicated that CAPS is entirely mediated by IL-1beta and that canakinumab treatment restores physiological IL-1beta production </plain></SENT>
