<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>(AID) are characterized by recurrent episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> variably associated with serosal, synovial and / or cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, usually in a self-limiting manner, and with a mostly monogenic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims were to determine the incidence of CAPS and the spectrum of mutations in the NLRP3 (formerly= CIAS1) gene and to describe the clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective surveillance of children with CAPS was conducted in Germany during a time period of 3 years(2003-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monthly inquiries were sent to 370 children's hospitals by the German Paediatric Surveillance Unit (Clinic-ESPED, n1) and to 2 laboratories (Laboratory-ESPED, n2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were children ≤ 16 years of age, disease-associated NLRP3 mutation, more than 3 self-limiting episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> &gt; 38.5 ° C, and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical, epidemiological and genetic data were evaluated via questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 6 out of 14 patients were identified in Clinic-ESPED (n1) and 13 / 14 in Laboratory-ESPED(n2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory surveys overlapped in 5 of 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CAPS in German children was estimated to be 3.43 per 10⁷ person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients carried 11 different NLRP3 mutations and were classified as MWS(n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e> (n = 4), FCAS (n = 1) and undefined CAPS (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The incidence of CAPS in Germany is very low and corresponds to 2-7 newly diagnosed patients ≤ 16 years per year </plain></SENT>
