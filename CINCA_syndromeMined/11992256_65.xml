<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations of CIAS1 have recently been shown to underlie familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> (FCU) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS), in three families and one family, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> diseases are both characterized by recurrent inflammatory crises that start in childhood and that are generally associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>sensorineural deafness</z:hpo> that occurs later in life is characteristic of MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>Amyloidosis</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>-associated type is the main complication of MWS and is sometimes associated with FCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In FCU, cold exposure is the triggering factor of the inflammatory crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified CIAS1 mutations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> located in exon 3, in nine unrelated families with MWS and in three unrelated families with FCU, originating from France, England, and Algeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five mutations--namely, R260W, D303N, T348M, A439T, and G569R--were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The R260W mutation was identified in two families with MWS and in two families with FCU, of different ethnic origins, thereby demonstrating that a single CIAS1 mutation may cause both syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that modifier genes are involved in determining either a MWS or a FCU phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The finding of the G569R mutation in an asymptomatic individual further emphasizes the importance of such modifier a gene (or genes) in determining the disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification of this gene (or these genes) is likely to have significant therapeutic implications for these severe diseases </plain></SENT>
