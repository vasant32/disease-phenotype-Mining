<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of the skin manifestations is, however, not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To clarify the nature of cutaneous cold sensitivity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> by studying clinical aspects and histological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen members of a family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> and the recently identified mutation of the CIAS1 gene at locus 260 of chromosome 1q44 were available for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination included a thorough history, physical examination and a battery of laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two brothers, standard cold contact and cold air provocation tests were performed, as were biopsies from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and lesional skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> affected family members reported an increased sensitivity to cold, dampness or changes in temperature, and most had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight had developed hearing loss, four renal involvement, and amyloid deposits were found in three of five patients in whom rectal biopsies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests showed leucocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein, but no serum cold agglutinins and cryoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Skin eruptions</z:e>, with weals of 0.2-3 cm, lasted from 5 to 24 h and were associated with local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e> or pain as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, malaise and chills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On cold provocation of two patients, lesions could be reproduced by cold air, but not by contact with an ice cube or cold water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On histology, there was increased vasodilatation, marked infiltration with neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, and increased expression of beta 2 integrins in lesional vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Numbers of mast cells as well as expression of interleukin-3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cold-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> represent typical generalized cold air/wind inflammatory reactions, as also observed in familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Microscopic features are similar to those observed in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
