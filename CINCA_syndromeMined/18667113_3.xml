<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Development of an instrument for characterization of symptom patterns and severity in patients with cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two generations of daily health assessment forms (DHAFs) were evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first-generation DHAF queried 11 symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses of results obtained with that instrument identified five symptoms included in a revised second-generation DHAF that was tested for internal consistency and test-retest reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This DHAF was also assessed during the initial portion of a phase 3 clinical study of CAPS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight CAPS patients provided data for the first-generation DHAFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five symptoms (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo>, eye redness/pain, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>) were included in the revised second-generation DHAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptom severity was highly variable during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study phases with as many as 89% of patients reporting at least one symptom flare, and percentages of days with flares reaching 58% during evaluation of the second-generation instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean composite key symptom scores (KSSs) computed during evaluation of the second-generation DHAF correlated well with Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (r=0.91, p&lt;0.0001) and patient reports of limitations of daily activities (r=0.68, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Test-retest reliability and Cronbach's alpha's were high (0.93 and 0.94, respectively) for the second-generation DHAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of this DHAF during a baseline period and placebo treatment in a phase 3 clinical study of CAPS patients indicated strong correlations between baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KSS</z:e> and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's alpha's at baseline and test-retest reliability were also high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Potentially important study limitations include small sample size, the lack of a standard tool for CAPS symptom assessment against which to validate the DHAF, and no assessment of the instrument's responsivity to CAPS therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DHAF is a new instrument that may be useful for capturing symptom patterns and severity in CAPS patients and monitoring responses to therapies for these conditions </plain></SENT>
