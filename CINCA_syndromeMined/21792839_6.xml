<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 2-week-old male who presented with a swollen, erythematous left index finger and elevated serum markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He later developed cyclical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo>, diffuse pustular <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After not responding to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and achieving only moderate success with systemic steroid therapy, he was ultimately treated with recombinant IL-1Ra, anakinra, and experienced significant clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of his IL1RN gene revealed that the patient was compound heterozygous for a known mutation (E77X) associated with IL-1Ra deficiency and a novel mutation in exon 2 of the gene (c.140delC; p.T47TfsX4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His case highlights IL-1Ra deficiency as an autoinflammatory disease that is distinct from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal-onset</z:hpo> multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> but that also responds well to anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our patient is the first reported compound heterozygote for E77X and the novel mutation in exon 2 of the gene, the latter of which adds to what will surely be a growing database of pathologic mutations in IL1RN </plain></SENT>
