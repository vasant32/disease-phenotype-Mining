<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab, developed by Novartis AG (Basel, Switzerland), is an intravenously or subcutaneously administered, fully human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the bioactivity of human IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab has promising clinical safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and has demonstrated potential for the treatment of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab was recently granted EU orphan drug status for systemic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and early clinical trials have established that administration of canakinumab every 2 weeks is both safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous canakinumab (approved formulation) offers some advantages over the existing IL-1β-blocking treatment, anakinra, which must be injected daily and is often not well tolerated by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The long-term safety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> targeted anti-IL-1 therapies in CAPS remains an unanswered question owing to the relatively short clinical experience with these agents; as canakinumab produces sustained IL-1 suppression, vigilance is necessary to diagnose the development of adverse events, especially any associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
