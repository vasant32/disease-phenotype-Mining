<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> was characterized chiefly by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e>, and AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Markers from known periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> susceptibility loci were investigated in 7 affected and 11 healthy members of a north Indian family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included the TNFRSF1A locus (formerly known as TNFRI), which is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> on chromosome 12p13, the familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> locus (MEFV) on chromosome 16p13, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperimmunoglobulinemia</z:e> D and periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HIDS</z:e>) locus on chromosome 12q24, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e>/familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> (MWS/FCU) locus on distal chromosome 1q44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linkage to both TNFRSF1A and MEFV was definitively excluded, and DNA sequencing of these genes revealed no mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no evidence of linkage to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HIDS</z:e> locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, significant logarithm of odds scores for 5 markers from the MWS/FCU region were obtained in this family, and the disease segregated with the same haplotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have identified an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> in a north Indian family with clinical features overlapping some of those of MWS and FCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The susceptibility gene maps to distal chromosome 1q44, a region already implicated in both MWS and FCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Different mutations in the same (or a closely related) gene may be responsible for an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> with a broad phenotype among diverse ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
