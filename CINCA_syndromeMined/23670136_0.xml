<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inflammasomes are key inducers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in response to exogenous and endogenous stimuli, because they regulate the processing and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, inflammasomes have a crucial role in host defence against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, but they can also be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the NLRP3 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome has been shown to play a part in several inflammatory rheumatic disorders, although the mechanisms involved are better elucidated in some of these diseases than in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, the pathogenesis of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> and microcrystal-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arthritides</z:e> is thought to be dependent on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and IL-1 inhibition has shown efficacy as a therapeutic strategy in both groups of conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this Review, we describe the current understanding of the mechanisms that trigger the inflammasome, and consider the relevance of the inflammasome to a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we discuss the current therapies targeting this molecular complex, as well as future therapeutic prospects </plain></SENT>
