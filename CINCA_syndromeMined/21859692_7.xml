<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Longer-term effects of prolonged selective interleukin-1β blockade with canakinumab were evaluated in the largest cohort of cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) patients studied to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult and paediatric CAPS patients (n=166, including canakinumab-naive and pretreated patients from previous studies) received canakinumab subcutaneously 150 mg or 2 mg/kg (≤40 kg) every 8 weeks for up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response and relapse was assessed using scores for disease activity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> and C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or serum amyloid A (SAA) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete response was achieved in 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 141 patients with an available relapse assessment, 90% did not relapse, their CRP/SAA levels normalised (&lt;10 mg/l) by day 8, and remained in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median treatment duration was 414 days (29-687 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upward adjustments of dose or frequency were needed in 24.1% patients; mostly children and those with severe CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Predominant adverse events (AE) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (65.7%) of mostly mild-to-moderate severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serious AE reported in 18 patients (10.8%) were mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and were responsive to standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (92%) reported having no injection-site reactions and only 8% patients reported mild-to-moderate reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving vaccination (15%) showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous canakinumab 150 mg every 8 weeks was well tolerated and provided substantial disease control in children and adults across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CAPS phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher canakinumab doses in younger patients and more severe CAPS disease were efficacious in achieving complete responses without evidence of increased AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Trial registration number: NCT00685373 (clinicaltrials.gov) </plain></SENT>
