<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A web-based registry collecting baseline and clinical information on autoinflammatory diseases and related conditions is available in the member area of the PRINTO web-site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anonymised data were collected with standardised forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1880 (M:F=916:964) individuals from 67 centers in 31 countries have been entered in the Eurofever registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients (1388; 74%), reside in western Europe, 294 (16%) in the eastern and southern Mediterranean region (Turkey, Israel, North Africa), 106 (6%) in eastern Europe, 54 in Asia, 27 in South America and 11 in Australia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median diagnosis delay was 7.3 years (range 0.3-76), with a clear reduction in patients born after the identification of the first gene associated with autoinflammatory diseases in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A shared online registry for patients with autoinflammatory diseases is available and enrollment is ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are data available for analysis on clinical presentation, disease course, and response to treatment, and to perform large scale comparative studies between different conditions </plain></SENT>
