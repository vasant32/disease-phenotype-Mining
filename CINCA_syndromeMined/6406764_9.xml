<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predominant amyloid fibril protein was the amyloid A (AA) type determined by the following criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(a) Only antiserum against protein AA gave a strong specific reaction, whereas the other antisera with specificity against amyloid of immunoglobulin origin, i.e., A-lambda and A-kappa, did not stain using the indirect immunoperoxidase technique on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(b) In immunodiffusion, the predominant amyloid fibril protein from WAL isolated in pure form from formalin-fixed tissues precipitated in a line of identity with anti-AA and a purified and chemically identified protein AA from another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(c) Amyloid fibril protein from WAL had a molecular weight of 8000 to 9000 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and, thus, is in the same range as the commonly found protein AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(d) The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was that of protein AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the pure amyloid fibril protein AA (WAL), proteins of higher molecular weights with AA-antigenic determinants were also isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These proteins may represent protein AA in a complex form or protein AA linked to other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is the most likely cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> complicating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> an antiinflammatory therapy (as in other AA-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002726" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amyloidoses</z:e>) is recommended </plain></SENT>
