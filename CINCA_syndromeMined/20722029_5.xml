<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether demographic, clinical, or laboratory characteristics at the time of diagnosis may identify patients who are at high risk for severe disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to analyze clinical and laboratory features of MWS, compare genetically defined subcohorts, and identify risk factors for severe MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicenter cohort study of consecutive MWS patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters assessed included clinical features, MWS Disease Activity Score (MWS-DAS), <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers, and cytokine levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E311K mutation-positive patients were compared with E311K mutation-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Putative risk factors for severe MWS (defined as an MWS-DAS score of â‰¥10) were assessed in univariate analyses, and significant predictors were entered into a multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (15 male and 17 female) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent organ manifestations were musculoskeletal symptoms and eye and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal disease</z:e> and hearing loss were seen in &gt;50% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetically defined subcohorts had distinct phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Severe disease activity was documented in 19 patients (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Predictors of severe MWS identified at the time of diagnosis were female sex, hearing loss, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026857" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">musculoskeletal disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate</z:hpo>, and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Female sex and hearing loss remained significant after adjustment for age in a multivariate model (relative risk 1.8 and 2.6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MWS patients at high risk for severe disease can be identified at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Female patients presenting with hearing loss have the highest likelihood of manifesting severe MWS and should be considered a high-risk group </plain></SENT>
