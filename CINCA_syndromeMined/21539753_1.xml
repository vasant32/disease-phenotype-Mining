<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two different strategies were used to collect data on patients with periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes from ECE countries- the Eurofever survey and collection of data with the structured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 35 centers in 14 ECE countries were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> together there were 11 patients reported with genetically confirmed familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>), 14 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi>-kinase deficiency (MKD), 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e>) and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CINCA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher numbers were reported for suspected cases which were not genetically tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> together there were 49 suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients reported, 24 MKD, 16 TRAPS, 7 CINCA and 2 suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of genetically confirmed patients with periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes in ECE countries is very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to identify more patients in the future, it is important to organize educational programs for increasing the knowledge on these diseases and to establish a network for genetic testing of periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes in ECE countries </plain></SENT>
