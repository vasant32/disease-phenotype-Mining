<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the development of a methodology for the simultaneous determination and quantification of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and related compounds (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33216">bisphenol A</z:chebi>, monobromobisphenol A, dibromobisphenol A, and tribromobisphenol A) in sludge and sediment samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The selected method is based on an extraction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15767">dichloromethane</z:chebi>: <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> followed by purification via SPE C(18) cartridges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Instrumental determination was carried out by liquid chromatography-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS), with quantification based on isotopic dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyte recoveries were in the range of 39-120% and 88-126% for spiked sewage and sediment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeatability of replicate extractions was better than 13% relative standard deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linearity was checked in the range of 0.05 and 25 injected nanograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 0.6 and 2.7 ng/g and 1.4 and 66 ng/g for sediment and sludge samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The developed method was applied to sewage sludge and sediment samples collected along the Ebro River and Cinca River, one of its tributaries (northeast of Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TBBPA levels in sewage sludge ranged from not quantified to 1,329 ng/g dw, whereas levels in sediment samples were lower, between not detected and 15 ng/g dw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As regards HBCD, concentrations were between not detected and 375 ng/g for sludge samples and 0.8 and 1850 ng/g for sediments </plain></SENT>
