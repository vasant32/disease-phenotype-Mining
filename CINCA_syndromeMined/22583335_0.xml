<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryopyrin-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> respond to treatment with interleukin-1 antagonists, and single case reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schnitzler syndrome</z:e> have shown improvement following treatment with the interleukin-1 blocker anakinra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the effects of the interleukin-1 antagonist rilonacept on the clinical signs and symptoms of SchS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with SchS were included in this prospective, single-center, open-label study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 3-week baseline, patients received a subcutaneous loading dose of rilonacept 320 mg followed by weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was determined by patient-based daily health assessment forms, physician's global assessment (<z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi>), and measurement of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and S100 calcium-binding protein A12 (S100A12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with rilonacept resulted in a rapid clinical response as demonstrated by significant reductions in daily health assessment scores and <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> scores compared with baseline levels (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects, which were accompanied by reductions in CRP and SAA, continued over the treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rilonacept treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no treatment-related severe adverse events and no clinically significant changes in laboratory safety parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rilonacept was effective and well tolerated in patients with SchS and may represent a promising potential therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
