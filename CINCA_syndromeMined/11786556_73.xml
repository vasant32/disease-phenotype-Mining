<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The PYRIN domain is a recently identified protein-protein interaction domain that is found at the N terminus of several proteins thought to function in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that PYPAF1 (PYRIN-containing Apaf1-like protein 1) is a novel PYRIN-containing signaling protein that belongs to the nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>/LRR) family of signaling proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of PYPAF1 is highly restricted to immune cells, and its gene maps to chromosome 1q44, a locus that is associated with the rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> and familial cold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify downstream signaling partners of PYPAF1, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid screen and identified ASC as a PYRIN-containing protein that interacts selectively with the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When expressed in cells, ASC recruits PYPAF1 to distinct cytoplasmic loci and induces the activation of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, coexpression of PYPAF1 with ASC results in a potent synergistic activation of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that PYPAF1 and ASC function as upstream activators of NF-kappaB signaling </plain></SENT>
