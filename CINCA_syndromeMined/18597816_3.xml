<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Polybrominated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ethers</z:chebi> (PBDEs) are chemicals of environmental concern due to their lipophilic, persistent and bioaccumulable characteristics as well as for their potential <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disrupting role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Former studies carried out in a tributary of the Cinca river (Ebro basin, NE Spain) revealed high levels of PBDEs in fish due to the discharges of effluents rich in PBDEs coming from a nearby industrial park in Barbastro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, several biomarkers of pollutants exposure were measured in barbel, Barbus graellsii, before (upstream) and after (downstream) the main industrial site (Barbastro) in the Vero river </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results evidenced an enhanced hepatic phase I and II metabolism (measured as reductases, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S transferase and uridinediphospho-glucuronosyltransferase), and of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, fishes collected from downstream reaches had their phase I CYP1A dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34480">ethoxyresorufin</z:chebi> O-deethylase, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> diaphorase and brain cholinesterase activities depleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the histological study of the liver and kidney of these fish evidenced an increase of the number and size of macrophage aggregates in most individuals collected downstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bivariate correlated analyses showed that the above mentioned biomarkers were correlated to measured PBDE congeners, thus indicating that the observed biological effects were unlikely to be related to other environmental factors than PBDEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the measured biochemical and histological markers provide new evidence that in field exposed fish, PBDEs levels were associated with high activities of phase I and II metabolic enzymes, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in liver, neurotoxicity in brain and histopathological effects in both liver and kidney </plain></SENT>
