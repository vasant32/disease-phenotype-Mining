<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations in genes for familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> have been reported to have increased in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA samples from 97 patients with BD and 51 matched healthy controls were analysed for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> kinase (MVK), cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome 1 (CIAS1) and proline/serine/threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) genes, responsible for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> kinase deficiency (MKD), cryopyrin associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e> (CAPS) and pyogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000999'>pyoderma</z:hpo> gangrenosum and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> (PAPA) syndrome, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 90% of known mutations were screened using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and/or sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients had paired mutations in the MVK gene (genotypes V377I/V377I and V377I/S135L) and displayed typical features of BD and MKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another was heterozygotic for the V377I genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The V198M mutation in the CIAS1 gene was identified in one patient with typical BD but no symptoms of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations were identified in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PSTPIP1 analysis revealed a new exon 10 insertion variant (c.741+33_741+34insGT) in 2 of 97 patients and in 1 of 51 controls (p&gt;0.05), indicating that it is a polymorphism rather than a true mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study could not demonstrate any significant increases in MVK, CIAS1 or PSTPIP1 mutations in patients with BD as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
