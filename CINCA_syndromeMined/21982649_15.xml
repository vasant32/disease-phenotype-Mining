<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of the atherothrombotic process, and patients with elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) have increased vascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, it remains unknown whether direct inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> will reduce cardiovascular event rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The CANTOS will evaluate whether interleukin-1β (IL-1β) inhibition as compared with placebo can reduce rates of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among stable patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> who remain at high vascular risk due to persistent elevations of hsCRP (&gt;2 mg/L) despite contemporary secondary prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes IL-1β, a proinflammatory cytokine that plays multiple roles in the atherothrombotic process and that undergoes activation by the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing pyrin receptor 3 inflammasome, a process promoted by cholesterol crystals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Canakinumab significantly reduces systemic C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarker levels, is generally well tolerated, and is currently indicated for the treatment of inherited IL-1β driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multinational collaborative effort using an event-driven intention-to-treat protocol, CANTOS will randomly allocate 17,200 stable postmyocardial infarction patients with persistent elevation of hsCRP to either placebo or to canakinumab at doses of 50, 150, or 300 mg every 3 months, administered subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants will be followed up over an estimated period of up to 4 years for the trial primary end point (nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) as well as for other vascular events, total mortality, adverse events, and specific clinical end points associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> including new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: If positive, CANTOS would confirm the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis and provide a novel cytokine-based therapy for the secondary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
