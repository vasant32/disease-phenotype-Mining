<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of CAPS varies from mild to severe and includes the syndromes historically described as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</z:e> (FCAS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Muckle-Wells syndrome</z:e> (MWS), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003623'>neonatal-onset</z:hpo> multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article presents the largest cohort of patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective is to describe the pathogenesis, otolaryngologic, and audiologic manifestations of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Prospective (2003-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: National Institutes of Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with a diagnosis of CAPS were identified (31 NOMID, 11 NOMID/MWS, 9 MWS, and 6 FCAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive data regarding clinical manifestations, audiologic phenotype, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI (FLAIR-MRI) of the brain and inner ear were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete audiologic data obtained on 70% of ears revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> in 4 (11%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> ears and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000410'>mixed hearing loss</z:hpo> in 5 (13%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e> and 2 (14%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/MWS ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> (SNHL), worse in higher frequencies, was the most common type of hearing loss and was present in 23 (61%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>, 10 (71%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/MWS, and 4 (33%) MWS ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients with FCAS had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearing except 2, who had SNHL from 4 to 8 kHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On FLAIR-MRI sequence, cochlear enhancement was noted in 26 of 29 (90%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>, 6 of 11 (55%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOMID</z:e>/MWS, 3 of 9 (33%) MWS, and 1 of 6 (17%) FCAS patients and was significantly associated with the presence of hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Maxillary sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and mucosal thickening were found in 39% and 86% of the cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CIAS1 pathwayâ€“mediated CAPS is associated with unregulated autoinflammation mediated by interleukin-1 in the cochlea and hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Timely diagnosis is crucial to initiate early treatment with interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
