<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIAS1 codes for the protein Cryopyrin, which appears to play a role in innate immune function by regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human and mouse Cryopyrin are highly conserved and consist of three functional domains including a pyrin domain, an NACHT domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that are characteristics of the NALP family of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pyrin and NACHT domains of Cryopyrin and other NALP proteins are highly conserved among primate and nonprimate mammals, suggesting purifying selection throughout mammalian evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryopyrin expression is also very similar in human and mouse with mouse CIAS1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression found primarily in peripheral blood leukocytes consistent with the postulated inflammatory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also detected significant expression in mouse eye and skin tissue, which is consistent with symptoms observed in human Cryopyrin-associated diseases </plain></SENT>
