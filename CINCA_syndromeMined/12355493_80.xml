<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000407'>Sensorineural deafness</z:hpo> in MWS, and provocation of symptoms by cold in FCU, are distinctive features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to characterize the genetic basis of FCU, MWS, and an overlapping disorder in French Canadian, British, and Indian families, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutations in the candidate gene NALP3, which has also been named CIAS1 and PYPAF1, were sought in the study families, in a British/Spanish patient with apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> MWS, and in matched population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identified variants were sought in 50 European subjects with uncharacterized, apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes, 48 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), and 19 subjects with juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Point mutations, encoding putative protein variants R262W and L307P, were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected members of the Indian and French Canadian families, respectively, but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The R262W variant was also present in the subject with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> MWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The V200M variant was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected members of the British family with MWS, in 2 of the 50 subjects with uncharacterized periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo>, and in 1 of 130 Caucasian and 2 of 48 Indian healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No mutations were identified among the subjects with RA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that mutations in the NALP3/CIAS1/PYPAF1 gene are associated with FCU and MWS, and that disease severity and clinical features may differ substantially within and between families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of this gene will improve classification of patients with inherited or apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
