<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anakinra (Kineret) is known to block IL-1 receptor and in the few patients with FCAS in whom it has been used, it has been shown to provide relief for this lifelong disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of anakinra (Kineret) in FCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight affected family members aged 29 to 77 years received anakinra 100 mg subcutaneously daily for 4 weeks preceded and followed by a 2-week control period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment was rapidly effective paralleled by the immediate fall of the C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significant side effect was an injection-site reaction in 50%, which declined in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect was sustained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> who continued to use the treatment at 4 and 16 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first treatment of FCAS that is completely effective while it is used </plain></SENT>
