<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progressive nerve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> develops subsequently, and, after several years, the disease is complicated by multiorgan AA-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> derived from the inflammatory serum amyloid-associated protein) (MIM 191900) with renal involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of MWS is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a genomewide search strategy in three families, we identified the locus responsible for MWS, at chromosome 1q44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the gene is located within a 13.9-cM region between markers D1S2811 and D1S2882, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>66 (recombination fraction.00) at D1S2836 when full penetrance is assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further identification of the specific gene that is responsible for MWS will therefore provide the first biological element for characterizing MWS, other than doing so on the basis of its variable clinical expression </plain></SENT>
