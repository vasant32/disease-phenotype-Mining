<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NLRP3/CIAS1 E311K mutation caused a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> phenotype of MWS in a large family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the clinical spectrum, patterns of inflammatory parameters and reports on response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 42 patients and family members were screened for the presence of the NLRP3 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms were reviewed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Classical (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP)) and novel MWS inflammatory markers (serum amyloid A (SAA), cytokines, cytokine receptor levels) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with the IL-1 inhibitors Anakinra or Canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 clinically affected patients were heterozygous carriers of the amino acid substitution p.Glu311Lys/E311K encoded by exon 3 of the NLRP3 gene, but none of the healthy family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease manifestations varied widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Except for one child, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carriers suffered from hearing loss and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TNF-Î±, IL-6, TNF-RI, and TNF-RII levels as well as SAA were elevated in three, two, one, six and ten patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both clinical and laboratory parameters responded quickly and sustainedly to treatment with Anakinra or Canakinumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The NLRP3 E311K mutation is associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> clinical spectrum, which may expand the view on MWS presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The leading symptom was hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>Pericarditis</z:hpo>, a rare but severe clinical feature of MWS, was diagnosed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient had a severe course, which led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>IL-1 inhibition leads to rapid and sustained improvement of symptoms </plain></SENT>
