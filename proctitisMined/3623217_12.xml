<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The surface pH of rat distal colonic mucosa and human rectal mucosa was measured in vitro using first a small pH electrode with a flattened tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In buffer with pH 7.56 the mean rat colonic surface pH was 6.72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lowering the buffer pH in steps resulted in a small fall in surface pH, the values being buffer pH 7.06 surface pH 6.64, buffer pH 6.58 surface pH 6.61 and finally buffer pH 6.09 surface pH 6.39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained with a buffer where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, 30 mmol/l replaced <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and when a <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>/bicarbonate buffer was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the time taken for the study transmural potential difference only changed by 1-2 mV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serosal surface pH changed with buffer pH, suggesting that the maintained surface pH is a property of the mucosal surface only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surface pH of human rectal mucosa was similar to that of rat distal colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As buffer pH fell from pH 7.51 to 5.96 mucosal surface pH only fell from pH 6.80 to 6.26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The values obtained in ulcerative <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> did not differ from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondly pH microelectrodes were used to measure the juxta mucosal pH and the pH-microclimate thickness when <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> pH was controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The microclimate had a pH 6.63 adjacent to the mucosa with a thickness of 840 micron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The importance of mucus in maintaining the microclimate was shown by n-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> cysteine thinning and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> thickening the layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results describe a surface microclimate in the large intestine of appreciable thickness and a constant juxta mucosal pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> pH changes produce only a small change in microclimate pH </plain></SENT>
