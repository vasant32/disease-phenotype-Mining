<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study an assessment of the number of enterochromaffin cells and expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24702">hydroxyindole</z:chebi>-O-methyltransferase in colonic mucosa and urine excretion of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 30 healthy subjects (group I-C), 30 patients with ulcerative <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> [group II-ulcerative <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> (UP)] and 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> [group III-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC)] in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of enterochromaffin cells (EC) was estimated in rectal and colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bioptates were assembled from many different parts of the large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunorective cells collected from various parts of the colon were counted according to the Eurovision DAKO (Dako A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) System in the range of 10 fields in each bioptate at × 200 magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24702">hydroxyindole</z:chebi>-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) in colonic mucosa was estimated with RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-HMS) excretion was determined immunoenzymatically using an IBL (IBL International GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) kit (RE 54031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of EC cells in healthy subjects (C) was 132.40 ± 31.26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients of group II (UP) and group III (UC) the number of these cells was higher--225.40 ± 37.35 (P &lt; 0.001) and--225.24 ± 40.50 (P &lt; 0.001) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar differences were related to HIOMT expression, which was 1.04 ± 0.36 in group C, 1.56 ± 0.56 (P &lt; 0.01) in group UP and 2.00 ± 0.35 (P &lt; 0.001) in group UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour 6-HMS urinary excretion was as follows: C--6.32 ± 4.95 μg/24 h, UP - 26.30 ± 7.29 μg/24 h (P &lt; 0.01), UC--2.30 ± 12.56 μg/24 h (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A correlation between number of EC cells and 6-HMS excretion was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups: r = 0.766 in patients with UP, r = 0.703 with UC and r = 0.8551 in the control group; the correlation between the results is statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases of both UP and UC, proliferation of EC cells and high expression of HIOMT and urine excretion of 6-HMS is noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These changes may represent a beneficial response in the anti-inflammatory and defense mechanism </plain></SENT>
