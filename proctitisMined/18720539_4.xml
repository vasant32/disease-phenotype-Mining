<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether thalidomide prevents microvascular injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> in white rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen female Wistar rats were used: six in the radiation group, six in the thalidomide group, and two in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiation and thalidomide groups were irradiated at the pelvic area using a single 30 Gy exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The thalidomide (150 mg/kg) was injected into the peritoneum for 7 d from the day of irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were sacrificed and the rectums were removed on day 8 after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The microvessels of resected specimens were immunohistochemically stained with thrombomodulin (TM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> Factor (vWF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The microscopic scores did not differ significantly between the radiation and thalidomide groups, but both were higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of TM was significantly lower in the endothelial cells (EC) of the radiation group than in the control and thalidomide groups (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of capillaries expressing vWF in the EC was higher in the radiation group (15.3+/-6.8) than in the control group (3.7+/-1.7), and the number of capillaries expressing vWF was attenuated by thalidomide (10.8+/-3.5, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intensity of VEGF expression in capillaries was greater in the radiation group than in the control group and was also attenuated by thalidomide (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> radiation-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> in the rats are related to endothelial cell injury of microvessel, which may be attenuated with thalidomide </plain></SENT>
