<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2007 and December 2011, 80 patients with histologically confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were clinically classified as either T3 or T4 and by the N stage based on the presence or absence of positive regional lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received intensified combined modality treatment, consisting of neoadjuvant radiation therapy (50.4-54.0 Gy) and infusional chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 50 mg/m(2)) on the first day of each week, plus five daily continuous infusions of fluorouracil (200 mg/m(2) per die) from the first day of radiation therapy until radiotherapy completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received five or six cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> based on performance status, clinical lymph node involvement, and potential risk of a non-sphincter-conserving surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery was planned 7 to 9 wk after the end of radiochemotherapy treatment; adjuvant chemotherapy treatment was left to the oncologist's discretion and was recommended in patients with positive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were monitored every three months for the first year and every six months for the subsequent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 80 patients enrolled, 75 patients completed the programmed neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received the radiotherapy prescribed total dose; five patients suspended chemotherapy indefinitely because of chemotherapy-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At least five cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> were administered to 73 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated with high compliance and a good level of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxic effects observed were classified as grades 1-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>Proctitis</z:mp> grade 2 was the most common symptom (63.75%) and the earliest manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> toxicity grades 3-4 was reported in 30% of patients and grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea reported in just three patients (3.75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients underwent surgery; low anterior resection was performed in 52 patients, Miles' surgery in 11 patients and total mesorectal excision in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> downsizing ≥ 50% pathological downstaging in 88.00% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Out of 75 patients surviving surgery, 67 patients (89.33%) had some form of downstaging after preoperative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A pathological complete response was achieved in 23.75% of patients and a nearly pathologic complete response (stage ypT1ypN0) in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>An involvement of the radial margin was never present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>During surgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854198" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intra-abdominal metastases</z:e> were found in only one patient (1.25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Initially, 45 patients required an abdominoperineal resection due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> distal margin ≤ 5 cm from the anal verge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, only seven of them underwent Miles' surgery and sphincter preservation was guaranteed in 84.50% of patients in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients received postoperative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In the full analysis of enrolled cohort, eight of the 80 patients died, with seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and one to unrelated causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Local recurrences were observed in seven patients (8.75%) and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in 17 cases (21.25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The five-year rate of overall survival rate was 90.91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Using a median follow-up time of 28.5 mo, the cumulative incidence of local recurrences was 8.75%, and the overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 90.00% and 70.00%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> chemotherapy has a beneficial effect on overall survival, likely due to an increase in local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
