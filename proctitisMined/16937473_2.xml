<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 120 rats were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four groups (n = 30) were analyzed with one group for each of the following applied therapy modalities: control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>, formalin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3077">betamethasone</z:chebi>, and misoprostol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single fraction of 17.5 Gy was delivered to each rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats in control group rats were given saline, and the rats in the other three groups received appropriate enemas twice a day beginning on the first day after the irradiation until the day of euthanasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On d 5, 10, and 15, ten rats from each group were euthanized and a pathologist who was unaware of treatment assignment examined the rectums using a scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The histopathologic scores for surface epithelium, glands (crypts) and lamina propria stroma of the rectums reached their maximum level on d 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control and formalin groups had the highest and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> had the lowest, respectively on d 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the 15th d, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3077">betamethasone</z:chebi>, and misoprostol had the lowest scores of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3077">betamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Mesalazine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3077">betamethasone</z:chebi>, and misoprostol are the best topical agents for radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> and formalin has an inflammatory effect and should not be used </plain></SENT>
