<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These changes are predominantly mucosal, although confusing histological features including granulomas may be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathology of 15 defunctioned rectal stumps has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had previously undergone urgent total colectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and rectal stumps had been left in situ while they awaited pelvic ileal reservoir construction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rectal stumps showed predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e> but there were additional features such as florid lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (12 cases), transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (nine cases), granulomas (four cases), fissures (eight cases), and changes akin to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> or to pseudomembraneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes may result from a combination of defunctioning and of active ulcerative <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 colectomy specimens showed unequivocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and none of the patients has subsequently shown any clinical, radiological, or pathological evidence to support a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology of the rectal stump in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and the patient may subsequently be denied the advantage of a pelvic ileal reservoir </plain></SENT>
