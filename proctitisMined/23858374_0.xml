<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common presentation is with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, but also rectal pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, tenesmus and even passage of mucus can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optimal treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> due to radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among various therapeutic options, medical management is generally ineffective and surgical intervention has a high incidence of morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Promising advances have been made in endoscopic therapy, including <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation (APC), formalin application as well as new techniques such as radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APC is a safe, highly effective and long-lasting therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> associated with radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that several sessions of APC reduce the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and therefore the blood transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effect of treatment is long lasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, best results are achieved in patients with mild to moderate radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, leaving space for alternative treatments for patients with more severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with severe or refractory radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> intra rectal formalin application is an appropriate treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation have shown efficacy as alternative methods in a limited number of patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
