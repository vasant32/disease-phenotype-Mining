<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those reacting with components of neutrophil cytoplasm are associated with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both nuclear and perinuclear staining patterns on human neutrophils have been reported using sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the reactivity against human neutrophils of sera from 100 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, 14 disease controls, and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether 27/50 (54%) sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> contained antibodies that reacted with cytospun <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> fixed neutrophils compared with 5/50 (10%) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (p less than 0.001) and 0/34 control sera (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven sera from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> alone were negative (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between presence or titre of anti-neutrophil antibodies and either disease activity or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive sera gave three different staining patterns on human neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predominant pattern was perinuclear (17/32); 12 sera gave a cytoplasmic and three a homogeneous nuclear staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients or the controls had antibodies to myeloperoxidase, elastase, or serine proteinase 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are recognised by anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 2/27 sera positive by indirect immunofluorescence reacted with an extract of neutrophil primary granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, anti-neutrophil antibodies occur more commonly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or control subjects and the anti-neutrophil antibodies found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> are different from those associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
