<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: An accurate clinical assessment of disease activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) is essential to provide appropriate management strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concurrent presence of functional symptoms in IBD patients is common and said to occur in 80% of <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> patients, 60% of UC patients and 40% of Crohn's patients.(1) A high symptom index can strongly influence clinical assessment and expose patients to unnecessary investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Faecal calprotectin (FC) has a high negative predictive value of 96% for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> therefore allowing use in this cohort to differentiate functional and organic symptoms.(2) METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FC data over a 2 year period was collected in IBD outpatients with a diagnostic uncertainty about symptoms being functional or organic in nature and whether further endoscopic examination was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FC results were regarded as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (&lt;50 μg/g), borderline (50-100 μg/g) or positive (&gt;100 μg/g) and correlated with endoscopic assessment and subsequent influence on management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 262 FC measurements were performed in IBD patients where there was diagnostic uncertainty about symptoms being organic or functional in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, unnecessary colonoscopy was spared in 83% (218/262), including 62/66 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FC, 26/27 borderlines and 130/169 positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FC, 4 patients underwent further assessment via colonoscopy for routine surveillance with no evidence of active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, some patients were investigated with CT colonography as an alternative assessment method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>0/2 scans in the borderline group showed positive findings with 6 being performed in the positive FC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 5 had active disease with 1 showing a psoas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> requiring inpatient treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result of a positive FC, a direct change in management was made in 114/169 (67%) without the need for further endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the case of a negative FC result, 14/66 (21%) patients had an alteration in their treatment regimes to focus upon targeting functional bowel symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Faecal calprotectin measurement spared 80% of the colonoscopies being considered to assess symptomatic IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both positive and negative results had a strong influence on subsequent management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>FC measurement provides clinicians the confidence to isolate and manage functional symptoms in their IBD cohort, whilst preventing unnecessary treatment escalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In those with a positive FC result, appropriate treatment could be initiated whilst avoiding the increased risks of endoscopy in acutely inflamed patients </plain></SENT>
