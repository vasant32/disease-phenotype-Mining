<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> is unclear, but cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrating the mucosa have been implicated in mucosal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Fas ligand (FasL), expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes, induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cells expressing Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyse FasL expression in affected colonic mucosa to ascertain Fas-FasL interaction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was quantified in colonic mucosal specimens from healthy subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, using the competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> localisation was determined by in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of Fas in colonic mucosa was analysed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes of lamina propria lymphocytes that expressed FasL were analysed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was strongly expressed in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> lesions, but not in those associated with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or active <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridisation showed that FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression occurred in mononuclear cells infiltrating lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fas was expressed in epithelial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytometry showed that FasL was expressed in CD3 lymphocytes infiltrating the lamina propria in active lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FasL is expressed in CD3 lymphocytes infiltrating into <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> lesions, suggesting that Fas-FasL induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> participates in the mucosal damage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
