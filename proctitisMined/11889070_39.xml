<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Accumulation and infiltration by neutrophil granulocytes is a prominent feature in the local inflammatory process in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to evaluate human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL) as a specific neutrophil marker in the inflamed lesions of the colon and rectum in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The activity of intestinal neutrophils with respect to release of granule proteins was studied in 18 patients with UC (10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and eight with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>) and in 18 healthy controls using perfusion fluid and biopsies from the sigmoid colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The released amounts of the neutrophil granule proteins HNL and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were determined by radioimmunoassays, and the location of HNL and MPO in biopsies from colonic mucosa was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mucosal release of HNL and MPO was increased 10-55-fold in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their bowel biopsies demonstrated that only neutrophils were stained with anti-HNL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found correlations between HNL and levels of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in perfusion fluids from the sigmoidal segments of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, between HNL and GM-CSF in rectal segments in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, and in sigmoidal segments in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that the increased release of HNL and MPO in colorectal perfusion fluids indicates neutrophil involvement in the local inflammatory process, and suggest that HNL may serve as a specific marker of intestinal neutrophil activation in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF, and to some extent IL-8, may play a role in neutrophil accumulation and priming in this disease </plain></SENT>
