<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment of rectal strictures has been limited to surgery with high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a less invasive therapeutic approach for benign rectal strictures, endoscopic balloon dilation with or without intralesional steroid injection, has become a common treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present a case of benign post-radiation rectal stricture treated successfully with balloon dilation and adjuvant intralesional triamcinolone injection </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy revealed a stricture at the rectum and multiple endoscopic biopsies were obtained from the stricture </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedure appears to have a high success rate and a very low complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the biopsies revealed non-specific inflammatory changes of the rectal mucosa and no specific changes of the mucosa due to radiation </plain></SENT>
