<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a consensus on the classification, diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment of perianal fistulising <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (pCD), based on best available evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on a systematic literature review, statements were formed, discussed and approved in multiple rounds by the 20 working group participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consensus was defined as at least 80% agreement among voters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence was assessed using the modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highest diagnostic accuracy can only be established if a combination of modalities is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drainage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> is always first line therapy before initiating immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucosal healing is the goal in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas antibiotics and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> have a role as adjunctive treatments in pCD, anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (anti-TNF) is the current gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of infliximab is best documented although adalimumab and certolizumab pegol are moderately effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oral tacrolimus could be used in patients failing anti-TNF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Definite surgical repair is only of consideration in the absence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on a multidisciplinary approach, items relevant for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> management were identified and algorithms on diagnosis and treatment of pCD were developed </plain></SENT>
