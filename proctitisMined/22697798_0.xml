<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Solitary rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> syndrome (SRUS) is an uncommon although benign defecation disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the variable endoscopic manifestations of SRUS and its association with other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients diagnosed with SRUS histologically from January 1990 to February 2011 at The Aga Khan University, Karachi were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical records were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the clinical spectrum of the patients along with the endoscopic and histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 37.4 ± 16.6 (range: 13-80) years, 61 (53%) of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> per rectum was present in 82%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> in 49%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> in 23% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> in 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, solitary and multiple lesions were present in 79 (68%) and 33 (28%) patients respectively; ulcerative lesions in 90 (78%), polypoidal in 29 (25%), erythematous patches in 3 (2.5%) and petechial spots in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associated underlying conditions were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> in 7 (6%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> in 4 (3.5%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> in 2(2%), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in 3 (2.5%) while <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of colon was observed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had previous surgery for colonic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SRUS may manifest on endoscopy as multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, polypoidal growth and erythematous patches and has shown to share clinicopathological features with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002035'>rectal prolapse</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> cystica profunda (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) and inflammatory cloacogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>; therefore collectively grouped as mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may be associated with underlying conditions such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhoids</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High index of suspicion is required to diagnose potentially serious disease by repeated endoscopies with biopsies to look for potentially serious underlying conditions associated with SRUS </plain></SENT>
