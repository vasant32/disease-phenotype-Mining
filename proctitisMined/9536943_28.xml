<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of remission with lower doses would be an advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> suppositories (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Pentasa</z:chebi>) 1 g three times a week v placebo to maintain remission in patients with cryptogenetic <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety five patients with cryptogenetic <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> were randomised within two weeks of remission to receive for one year or until relapse three suppositories per week of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Pentasa</z:chebi> (n = 48) or placebo (n = 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of a relapse, the patients received one suppository/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was found that 25 of 48 subjects v 18 of 47 remained in remission in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> and placebo groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate was lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> group for the following time intervals: 0-90 days (19% v 38%, p = 0.035), 0-180 days (29% v 54%, p = 0.017), 0-270 days (38% v 60%, p = 0.031), and 0-365 days (48% v 62%, p = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of relapse with one suppository/day induced remission in 11 of 18 and 2 of 26 patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 61% v 28% patients remained in the protocol and were in remission at one year (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tolerance was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Mesalazine</z:chebi> suppositories 1 g three times a week are effective for preventing relapses of cryptogenetic <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
