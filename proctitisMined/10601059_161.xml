<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known about the prevalence, symptoms, diagnosis, attitude, and referral to specialists of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>) in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine these characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 3111 patients attending 36 general practitioners (GPs) at six varied locations in and near Bristol, UK, were screened to identify those with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017187" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal problem</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients (n=255) and their doctors were given questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six months later the case notes were examined to reach criteria based diagnoses of functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 255 patients with a gastrointestinal complaint, 30% were judged to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> and 14% other functional disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with 100 patients with an "organic" diagnoses, those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> were more often women and more often judged by their GP to be polysymptomatic and to have unexplained symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> (58%) were diagnosed as such by the GP; 22% had other functional diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, among 54 patients diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> by the GPs, the criteria based diagnosis was indeed functional in 91%; only one patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0683324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic disease</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e> than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0683324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic disease</z:e> feared <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most some fear remained after the visit to the doctor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On logistic regression analysis, predictors of referral to a specialist (29% referred) were denial of a role for stress, multiple tests, and frequent bowel movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Half the patients with gut complaints seen by GPs have functional disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These are usually recognised, and few patients are referred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> fears often remain, suggesting unconfident diagnosis or inadequate explanation </plain></SENT>
