<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty eight cases met diagnostic and residency criteria, for an overall age, and sex adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> incidence rate of 15.0 per 100,000 person years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The male:female ratio of age adjusted rates was 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age specific incidence was roughly bimodal in appearance but was not consistent in different patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On 1-1-80, there were 120 Rochester residents with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, corresponding to a prevalence rate of 225.2 per 100,000 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty three per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> incidence cases were 'definite' and 47% were 'probable', the former requiring consistent observations for at least six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The definite group had proportionately more men and disease of greater extent and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pancolitis</z:e> comprised about one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (4.6 per 100,000 person years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>Proctitis</z:mp> and distal disease (7.1 and 2.0 per 100,000 person years) made up most of the rest </plain></SENT>
