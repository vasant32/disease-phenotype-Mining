<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum resting anal canal pressure and the physiological sphincter length were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in the irradiated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rectosphincteric reflex was absent in one patient and showed abnormalities of recovery in four others, who had received radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The squeeze pressure of the external sphincter was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that dysfunction of the internal anal sphincter may contribute to patients' anorectal symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
