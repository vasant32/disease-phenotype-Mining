<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many cases resolve spontaneously, some lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptoms including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, tenesmus, urgency and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> requiring blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> remain unsatisfactory and the basis of evidence for various therapies is generally insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are very few controlled or prospective trials, and comparisons between therapies are limited because of different evaluation methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical treatments, including formalin, topical sucralfate, 5-amino <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> enemas, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short chain fatty acids</z:chebi> have been used with limited success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical management is associated with high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation is touted to be the preferred endoscopic therapy due to its efficacy and safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Newer methods of endoscopic ablation such as radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy have been recently described which may afford broader areas of treatment per application, with lower rate of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on endoscopic ablation therapies, including such newer modalities, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
