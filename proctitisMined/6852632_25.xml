<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This modification was used to study IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgG plasma cells in rectal biopsies from 20 controls, 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1257848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ulcerative proctocolitis</z:e>, 20 with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, 20 with non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, 15 with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> but no apparent large bowel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Counts were correlated with the characteristic histological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In controls the ratio of the mean counts for IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgG plasma cells was 8:3:3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> types of plasma cells were very significantly increased in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1257848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ulcerative proctocolitis</z:e>, Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, and non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> and counts correlated with the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the counts in these three groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When matched for severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> there was no significant difference between the counts in <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that changes in plasma cell counts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> are a non-specific response to mucosal damage, possible by a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> irritant, and do not differentiate the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
