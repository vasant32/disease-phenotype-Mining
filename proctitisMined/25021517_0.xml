<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Compared to conventional endoscopy, capsule endoscopy (CE) is potentially safer, non-invasive, performed in out-patients and may be an alternative first line investigation in patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In colon CE (CCE), a dormant mode (to save battery) is followed by device activation when small bowel mucosa is recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study patients with suspected small and/or large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> underwent a pan-enteric assessment using combined small bowel (SBCE) and CCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients underwent combined SCE and CCE using a novel protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had new GI symptoms (group A: symptoms alone or those with additional abnormal results - GI symptoms plus) or underwent assessment of known IBD (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures: diagnostic yield (relevant findings only), complications, CE completion rates and colon cleanliness (scored 1-4: excellent to poor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients (group A, n = 56; group B, n = 26; mean age 41) had refused (50%), had incomplete (21%) prior colonoscopy or chose to have CCE (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A patients had diarrhoea (62%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (54%); 17 had GI symptoms plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response (9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminaemia</z:hpo> (4), radiological abnormalities (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean SBCE and CCE SB examination times: 255 and 92 mins respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean C examination time: 167mins; median cleanliness score 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SBCE was complete in 73 (89%) and CCE in 58 patients (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group B, pathology was identified in 62%, 16/26 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> active Crohn's) which was significantly higher than in Group A (20%: 11/56, p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New diagnoses in Group A: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (n = 5) and one each of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_425'>leiomyoma</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0940958" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angioectasia</z:e>, diverticulae and idiopathic ulcerated small bowel stricture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>9/11 were in the symptoms plus group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>95% of pathology identified on SBCE was also identified on CCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No complications were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 62% of patients known to have IBD had active disease, but diagnostic yield was as high as 20% in those with new symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>IBD was the commonest and no complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Studies of the respective roles of faecal biomarkers, CE and histology in the diagnosis of IBD are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> small bowel pathology was recognised by CCE suggesting its use as a remote panenteric endoscopic tool only awaits further battery development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
