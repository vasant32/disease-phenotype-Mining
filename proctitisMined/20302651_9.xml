<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However there are few epidemiological data from the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To determine prevalence and clinical characteristics of IBD, a hospital-based survey was performed in the Colombo and Gampaha districts (combined population 4.5 million) in Sri Lanka </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), who were permanent residents of these adjoining districts, were recruited from hospital registries and out-patient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical information was obtained from medical records and patient interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 295 cases of IBD (UC = 240, CD = 55), of which 34 (UC = 30, CD = 4) were newly diagnosed during the study year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate for UC was 5.3/100,000 (95% CI 5.0-5.6/100,000), and CD was 1.2/100,000 (95% CI 1.0-1.4/100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates were 0.69/100,000 (95% CI 0.44-0.94/100,000) for UC and 0.09/100,000 (95% CI 0.002-0.18/100,000) for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female:male ratios were 1.5 for UC and 1.0 for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis was (males and females) 36.6 and 38.1y for UC and 33.4 and 36.2y for CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among UC patients, 51.1% had <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> and at presentation 58.4% had mild disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>80% of CD patients had only large bowel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Few patients had undergone surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBD in this population was low compared to Western populations, but similar to some in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a female preponderance for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>UC was mainly mild, distal or left-sided, while CD mainly involved the large bowel </plain></SENT>
