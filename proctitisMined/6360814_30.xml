<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry revealed a consistent increase in, and abnormal appearance of, VIP nerves in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> not only those with rectal involvement but also patients with no histological evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rectal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> control biopsies contained 1.64 +/- 0.39 pmol VIP/mg protein as compared with 3.43 +/- 1.24 pmol VIP/mg protein in tissue from patients with rectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 5.37 +/- 1.23 pmol VIP/mg protein in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> without rectal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 17 biopsies examined from ulcerative colitics showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of VIP innervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of the conventional histology of these biopsies showed that only areas with obvious active <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> had increased VIP nerves and, unlike the appearance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, these nerves had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The VIP content of these biopsies was similar to that of the controls; 1.34 +/- 0.37 pmol/mg protein </plain></SENT>
