<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current standard therapy for both these conditions is endoscopy with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> plasma coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This usually requires multiple endoscopies over time and in many patients may be ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the development of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CELLO">Barrett's Oesophagus</z:e>, we extended its use in these two settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The available literature is small and our study adds to this body of evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case record study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We collected data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who received RFA between December 2012 and November 2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data was collected from endoscopy reports and electronic case records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RFA was performed using the Halo 60,90 or through the scope probes at 12j energy (Barxx/Covidien) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients received RFA for GAVE and six patients for Radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GAVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with transfusion dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They needed 0.85 OGD/pt/month, 0.41 APC/pt/month and 6 units of packed cells /pt/month prior to RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Between 2-4 sessions of RFA was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Post RFA, there was a reduction in endoscopies to 0.34/pt/month (P 0.239) In two out of three patients no further transfusions were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hence there was a significant reduction in transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>(P 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>Proctitis</z:mp>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with PR <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One was transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A mean of 0.58 APC sessions were done per patient/month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction in the number of sigmoidoscopies from 0.87/pt/month to 0.2/pt/month (P 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>One patient who was requiring 9 units of packed cells per month stopped transfusions after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Number of RFA sessions was between 1-3 (mean: 1.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In the NHS, therapeutic sigmoidoscopy with APC costs £704 and therapeutic OGD is £667 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A single unit of blood transfusion costs £635 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>An RFA probe costs £920 and hence an RFA procedure proves cost effective above 2x APC or 2x blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Our only complication was one clinically insignificant stricturing but this was after 8xAPC and 3X RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Healing is optimum after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is better tolerated than APC in terms of comfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RFA for GAVE and RP is technically feasible, well tolerated and cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in blood transfusions in GAVE and requirement for Sigmoidoscopy in RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We have shown no significant complications and RFA should be considered as a first line treatment in refractory GAVE and in RP where <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We recognise this is a small, retrospective study but future work will include larger numbers, QoL data and establish if this should be considered the first line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
