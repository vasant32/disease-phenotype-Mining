<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>50% of patients develop bowel symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy which affects quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Historically, bowel symptoms post-pelvic radiotherapy have been labelled '<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>', although it is increasingly recognised that these symptoms are due to dysfunction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract at numerous points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evidence-base is poor and comprises often small, heterogenous, single centre unblinded studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article critically reviews the evidence for the medical treatment options for '<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>', which include <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, antibiotics, sucralfate, formalin and hyperbaric oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difficulties in extrapolation from the literature to clinical practise are also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the available evidence, rectal sucralfate appears to have greater efficacy than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi>, which are more effective if used with oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hyperbaric oxygen is emerging as promising treatment for radiation toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel dysfunction</z:e> post-pelvic radiotherapy is a complex clinical condition which reflects multi-site GI tract pathologies both related and unrelated to previous oncological treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From this review article a clear need for an adjustment to both diagnosis and treatment of these patients, as well as for further research, emerges </plain></SENT>
