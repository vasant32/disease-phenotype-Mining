<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gut DNA extracts were obtained from 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and four control subjects and were probed with a chlamydial plasmid probe after Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction was also used to amplify any chlamydial plasmid DNA present in tissue DNA extracts, before Southern blotting and probing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chlamydial <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> control specimens were not available: gut DNA extracts mixed with traces of chlamydia plasmid served as positive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these techniques, no chlamydial plasmid DNA sequences were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> tissue </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seropositivity was present in 14.6% of patients and 29% of control subjects and was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The failure to show chlamydial DNA and the lack of serological response to chlamydia make C trachomatis <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> a very unlikely factor in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
