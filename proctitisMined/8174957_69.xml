<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prospective surveillance programme for patients with longstanding (&gt; = 8 years), extensive (&gt; = splenic flexure) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was undertaken between 1978 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It comprised annual colonoscopy with pancolonic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty patients were entered into the programme and had 739 colonoscopies (4.6 colonoscopies per patient; 709 patient years follow up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight eight per cent of examinations reached the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no procedure related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One Dukes's A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty one patients (25%) defaulted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 25 remain well; 13 are unaccounted for, and one died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had colectomy for medical reasons, and another died of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively an additional 16 eligible patients were identified who had not been recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, 14 remain well, two are unaccounted for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients refused colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> remain well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Over the same period seven other cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancer</z:e> were found in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, two in patients who had erroneously been diagnosed as having only <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> and were therefore not entered into the programme, but were found at operation to have total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, one in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> of seven years duration, and four patients who had previously attended the clinic but had been lost to follow up before 1978 and then had represented with new symptoms during the surveillance period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, of the nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> diagnosed in this centre during the study period only one was detected by the surveillance programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results of this large study, a a review of published works, cast doubts on the effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance programmes in detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
