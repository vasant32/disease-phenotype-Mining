<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a French population-based cohort we identified 841 IBD patients &gt;60 years of age at diagnosis from 1988 to 2006, including 367 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and 472 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was similar for CD (70 years (IQR: 65-76)) and UC (69 years (64-74)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 6 years (2-11) for both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, in CD, pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">colonic disease</z:e> (65%) and inflammatory behaviour (78%) were the most frequent phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At maximal follow-up digestive extension and complicated behaviour occurred in 8% and 9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In UC, 29% of patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, 45% left-sided and 26% extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> without extension during follow-up in 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CD cumulative probabilities of receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (CSs), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> (ISs) and anti <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor therapy were respectively 47%, 27% and 9% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In UC cumulative probabilities of receiving CS and IS were 40% and 15%, respectively at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cumulative probabilities of surgery at 1 year and 10 years were 18% and 32%, respectively in CD and 4% and 8%, respectively in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In CD complicated behaviour at diagnosis (HR: 2.6; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.6) was associated with an increased risk for surgery while CS was associated with a decreased risk (HR: 0.5; 0.3 to 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In UC CS was associated with an increased risk (HR: 2.2; 1.1 to 4.6) for colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical course is mild in elderly-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This information would need to be taken into account by physicians when therapeutic strategies are established </plain></SENT>
