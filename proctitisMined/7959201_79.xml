<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in northern France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective population based study was realised through the gastroenterologists of the region Nord-Pas de Calais and the Somme Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each gastroenterologist referred patients consulting for the first time with clinical symptoms compatible with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were collected by an interviewer practitioner present at the gastroenterologist's consulting room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two independent expert gastroenterologists assessed each case in a blind manner and made a final diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, ulcerative <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp>, or unclassifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 1988 to 1990, 1291 cases of IBD were recorded: 674 (52%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 466 (36%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> including 162 <z:mp ids='MP_0003305'>proctitis</z:mp> (35%), and 151 (12%) unclassifiable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean annual incidence was 4.9 per 100,000 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 3.2 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio F/M was 1.3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 0.8 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest age specific incidence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was between 20 and 29 years: 13.1 for women and 9.8 for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest age specific incidence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was between 20 and 39 years: 5.5 for women and 6.5 for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This first French prospective study has shown an incidence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> comparable with that seen in north European studies but lower than that seen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results could be related to the different environmental factors or the genetic background of the population studied, or both </plain></SENT>
