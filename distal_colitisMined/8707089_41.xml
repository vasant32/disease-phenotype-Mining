<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short chain fatty acid</z:chebi> (SCFA) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> provides energy for colonocytes, stimulates colonic fluid and electrolyte absorption and is recognised as an effective treatment for multiple types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> enema therapy on the clinical course, severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and SCFA stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> absorption in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> was induced in rats with a trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>) enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five days after induction, rats were divided into groups to receive: no treatment, saline enemas, or 100 mM Na-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> enemas daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 24, colonic damage score and tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colon was mounted in Ussing chambers and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> transport and electrical activities were measured during a basal period and after stimulation with 25 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the untreated and the saline enema treated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> groups, diarrhoea and extensive colonic damage were seen, associated with increased tissue MPO activities and absent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> enema treated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> group, diarrhoea ceased, colonic damage score improved, and tissue MPO activity as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> absorption recovered to control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> enema therapy stimulated colonic repair, as evidenced by clinical recovery, decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and restoration of SCFA stimulated electrolyte absorption </plain></SENT>
