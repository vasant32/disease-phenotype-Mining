<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mucosal surface hydrophobicity is a key factor of the gastric acid defence barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the colon, surface hydrophobicity is high but its biological function remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the functional changes of the barrier due to removal of the surface active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> layer by a detergent, or to reinforcement of the surface active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> by local application of a suspension of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surface hydrophobicity (contact angle measurement), colonic permeability (lumen to blood clearance of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>), and mucosal resistance against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> (distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="32149">sodium sulphate</z:chebi>, DSS) were investigated in three study groups: (a) rats pretreated with a detergent (Brij 35) known to remove <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>; (b) rats pretreated with a suspension of surface active <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (tripalmitin and dipalmitoyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>); and (c) control rats pretreated with the corresponding vehicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In controls, surface hydrophobicity was low on the caecal mucosa and high in colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detergent treatment reduced surface hydrophobicity, and increased colonic permeability to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, treatment with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> increased surface hydrophobicity, and reduced colonic permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of DSS induced a progressive loss of colonic surface hydrophobicity, and an increase in permeability to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detergent treatment increased susceptibility to epithelial damage and mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by DSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> reduced susceptibility to DSS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonic surface hydrophobicity modulates permeability to hydrophilic molecules and protects against toxins </plain></SENT>
