<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether failure of the colon to salvage carbohydrate could contribute to the diarrhoea of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> we investigated the effect of ingesting a drink containing 20 g lactulose on stool output and breath hydrogen production in 39 colitic patients subdivided according to their disease extent and activity and in 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each subject took a standard diet for four days and stool output was monitored throughout this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of lactulose on day three significantly increased stool weight and frequency in patients with both active and quiescent total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01), but not in patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> or in the volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basal and peak breath hydrogen responses to ingested lactulose were similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups but the hydrogen concentration tended to be higher in colitics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mouth to caecum transit of the lactulose meal was slower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of colitics (p less than 0.02) when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that impaired colonic salvage of carbohydrate could contribute to the diarrhoea in patients with total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> who are ingesting a diet rich in unabsorbed carbohydrate, or who are hypolactasic </plain></SENT>
