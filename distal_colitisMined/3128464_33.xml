<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in one health district between 1975-84 revealed an incidence and prevalence of 7.1 and 84/100,000 population respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety five new patients were diagnosed and 313 patients seen and followed up in the clinic for 1168 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of these patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> or a complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On routine colonoscopy three cases had high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and two asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (Duke's stage A and B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty four patients were known to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, but were lost to follow up from the hospital clinic; the total time they were not under hospital surveillance was 315 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the study these patients were contacted or clinical details obtained from their general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients subsequently presented with symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (two Duke's B, one Duke's C and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>); three of these five patients have died from their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 48 patients thought to have only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> on initial investigation 21 (43%) had substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (and two <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) on colonoscopy after eight years of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients with apparently distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> should be followed in the clinic as well as those with known extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For a surveillance programme in a district general hospital, eight patients per 100,000 population need to be seen weekly, 12 colonoscopies/100,000 population need to be carried out annually and the cost for each <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> detected is approximately 6015 pounds </plain></SENT>
