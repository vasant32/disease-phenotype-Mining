<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Rectal preparations containing steroids or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylates</z:chebi> are an effective treatment for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, it is perceived that this therapy is associated with poor levels of adherence and that patients are not readily accepting of it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This might make gastroenterologists reluctant to prescribe rectal preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient experience and factors determining adherence with this modality of treatment have not been investigated before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our survey is to evaluate patient compliance with rectal preparations and explore the possible reasons why compliance is not always achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A short anonymised survey was distributed over a 3-month period at general gastroenterology and IBD outpatient clinics to patients with a known diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were questions on baseline demographics and other details relating to compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A free text option was also available for suggestions that could improve compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the period November 2013-January 2014, a total of 59 completed surveys were received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>21 of 59 patients (36%) had never been prescribed a rectal preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 38 patients with reported experience of rectal preparations, 60% were male with a median age of 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, 76% of these (29 patients) answered 'Yes' to being compliant with the preparation (s), and they had been prescribed courses ranging from once/day for 2 weeks to thrice/day long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>20 patients had been prescribed foam and/or liquid enemas, 8 patients a suppository, and 1 patient a suppository and foam enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>93% of the compliant patients reported an improvement in their symptoms with the use of rectal preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Though compliant, 24% reported 'Yes' to having difficulties using the rectal preparation citing "insertion difficulties" and "difficulty retaining the fluid" and "at work" as the main reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When asked for suggestions to improve compliance, 62% felt reduction of treatment frequency to once/day would help, and 21% felt that better explanation about administration would help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of the 9 patients who admitted to being noncompliant, 3 had difficulties with administration, 2 experienced pain, and the majority felt that a better explanation about administration would have improved compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As expected, the majority of noncompliant patients felt that the rectal preparation had made no difference to their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compliance with prescribed rectal preparations is surprisingly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This is an encouragement to continue promoting its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Compliance could be further improved by allowing for patient factors such as work hours and adjusting dosing times, and by dedicating time to explain how the medication should be administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
