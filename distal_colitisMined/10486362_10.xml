<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> may cause troublesome symptoms and alter quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When medical treatment fails to control symptoms, patients and doctors are often reluctant to consider surgical resection because of the relatively small portion of the large bowel affected by the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the outcome of restorative proctocolectomy (RP) in patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> who required surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> debilitating symptoms and failed medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: From 1986 to 1996, of 263 patients receiving RP for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, 27 (16 men) were operated on for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bowel function and quality of life were compared before and one year after RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was 11 (6) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RP was performed at a mean age of 46 (10) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the pouches were J-shaped, and a diverting loop ileostomy was always performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean (SD) hospital stay was 25 (10) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven complications occurred in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previously unknown severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was discovered on the colectomy specimen in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After RP there was a significant decrease in mean (SD) daytime stool frequency (8.2 (4) v 4.7 (2), p&lt;0.05), night-time stool frequency (2 (2) v 1 (1), p = 0.05), and the number of patients with urgency to defecate (26/27 v 1/27, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sex life was improved in eight patients, social life in 26, and professional life in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty six patients were satisfied with the results, and 25 wished that they had received surgery earlier in the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RP can improve bowel function and quality of life in patients with disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptoms of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
