<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to establish a method of investigating intestinal eosinophil and neutrophil granulocytes by flow cytometry, and to compare the distribution and activity of these cells in different stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsy samples were taken from six locations of the entire colon and from the terminal ileum in 10 patients with active total UC, 10 patients with inactive total UC, eight patients with active distal UC, and 11 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell suspensions from biopsies and from peripheral blood were incubated with fluorophore conjugated monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of scatter plot-gating and specific antibodies was established in a flow cytometry assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eosinophils were more numerous and more active in patients with active UC than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, during inactive UC, the number of activated eosinophils was even larger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eosinophil activity was high in the rectum of patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> but was also slightly elevated in the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils were increased in number and activity during active but not inactive UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, activated neutrophils were only found in the sigmoid colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With this method, we confirm that neutrophils participate in the inflammatory process during active UC, and that they express a resting phenotype during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding of activated eosinophils in inflamed intestine strengthens the view of these cells as proinflammatory and tissue damaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our new finding of high eosinophil activation during inactive UC suggests that eosinophils play a role in repair of injured epithelium </plain></SENT>
