<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is thought to be the cause of symptoms in some patients with distal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known, however, how often patients with active distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> exhibit slow colonic transit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty two consecutive patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> each ingested 10 radio-opaque markers nightly for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minimum colonic transit times were derived from counts of retained markers shown by plain abdominal radiography on the 15th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transit times for each patient were related to their disease extent and bowel frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had colonic transit times greater than one week and two others had evidence of relative stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that approximately 10% of attacks of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> are associated with faecal stasis </plain></SENT>
