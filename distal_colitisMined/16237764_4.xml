<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by a single intracolonic administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control rats received an enema of 0.9% saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed 48 h after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> or saline administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic and histologic lesions of the colon were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) activity were measured on the colonic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> rats, we evaluated spontaneous and evoked contractile activity in circular muscle strips derived from DUMC in comparison to the same colonic segment of control rats, both in the presence and in the absence of a non-selective NOS isoforms inhibitor N-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (L-NNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological characterization of electric field stimulation (EFS)-evoked contractile responses was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> rats, the distal colon showed severe histological lesions and a high MPO activity, while the DUMC exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histology and MPO activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Constitutive NOS activity was similar in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> and control rats, whereas inducible NOS activity was significantly increased only in the injured distal colon of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Isometrically recorded mechanical activity of circular muscle strips from DUMC of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> rats showed a marked reduction of the force and frequency of spontaneous contractions compared to controls, as well as of the contractile responses to a contracting stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the presence of L-NNA, the contractile activity and responses displayed a significantly greater enhancement compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological characterization of EFS contractile responses showed that a cooperative-like interaction between cholinergic muscarinic and tachykinergic neurokinin 1 and 2 receptors mediated transmission in DUMC of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi> rats vs a simple additive interaction in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that, during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53063,53506">TNBS</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, circular muscle intrinsic contractile mechanisms and possible enteric neural excitatory activity are inhibited in the distended uninflamed mid-colon </plain></SENT>
