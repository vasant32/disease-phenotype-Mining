<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and tested the therapeutic potential of a synthetic inhibitor (CGS-27023-A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> was induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (at 5% in drinking water for 5 days) in a group of eight rats, whereas a matched control group received plain water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases were measured in colonic tissue homogenates using zymography and Western blot on days 3 and 5 after induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another set of experiments, two groups of colitic rats (20 per group) were treated with CGS-27023-A (20 mg/kg) or vehicle, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On days 5 and 14, colonic mucosal lesions were blindly scored by microscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> led to a significant upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein and its activity, but no change in matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CGS-27023-A significantly decreased the extent and severity of epithelial injury but did not influence mucosal repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases may contribute to epithelial damage in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
