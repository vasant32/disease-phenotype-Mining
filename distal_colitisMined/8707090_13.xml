<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients with severe or refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> involving only the rectum and sigmoid colon are being offered restorative proctocolectomy with ileal reservoir but very few data are available concerning the outcome for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study was designed to compare the outcome of ileal pouch procedures for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> with procedures performed for more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 177 patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> between January 1984 and December 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected prospectively in a dedicated ileal pouch database and included demographic details, indication for surgery, surgical procedures performed, early (&lt; 30 days) and late morbidity, functional outcome, and histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no mortality in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence and range of early morbidity (&lt; 30 days) and the functional outcome (daytime stool frequency, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nocturnal frequency</z:e>, and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>) were similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Log rank analysis of Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no significant difference between groups in the likelihood of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> (p &gt; 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy for distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> experience a similar outcome to patients with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data refute the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376620" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pouchitis</z:e> is more common in patients with total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
