<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sall1 is a multi-zinc finger transcription factor that regulates kidney organogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered to be a transcriptional repressor, preferentially localized on heterochromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations or deletions of the human SALL1 gene are associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite its high expression, no function was yet assigned for Sall1 in embryonic stem (ES) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that Sall1 is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner and physically interacts with Nanog and Sox2, two components of the core pluripotency network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide mapping of Sall1-binding loci has identified 591 genes, 80% of which are also targeted by Nanog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of these genes are related to self-renewal and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sall1 positively regulates and synergizes with Nanog for gene transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, our data show that Sall1 suppresses the ectodermal and mesodermal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the induction of the gastrulation markers T brachyury, Goosecoid, and Dkk1 and the neuroectodermal markers Otx2 and Hand1 was inhibited by Sall1 overexpression during embryoid body differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate a novel role for Sall1 as a member of the transcriptional network that regulates stem cell pluripotency </plain></SENT>
