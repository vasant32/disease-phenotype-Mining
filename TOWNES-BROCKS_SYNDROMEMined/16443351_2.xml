<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of SALL1 on chromosome 16q12.1 cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>, OMIM 107480) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that SALL1 acts as a strong transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that SALL1 contains two repression domains, one located at the extreme N-terminus of the protein and the other in the central region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SALL1 fragments with the central repression domain exhibited a punctate nuclear distribution pattern at pericentromeric heterochromatin foci in murine NIH-3T3 cells, suggesting an association between repression and heterochromatin localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implications of these findings for the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> are discussed </plain></SENT>
