<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No function is yet known for SALL2, another human spalt-like gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structure of SALL2 is different from SALL1 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other vertebrate spalt-like genes described in mouse, Xenopus, and Medaka, suggesting that SALL2-like genes might also exist in other vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, we isolated and characterized a SALL2 homologous mouse gene, Msal-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other vertebrate spalt-like genes both SALL2 and Msal-2 encode only three double zinc finger domains, the most carboxyterminal of which only distantly resembles spalt-like zinc fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evolutionary conservation of SALL2/Msal-2 suggests that two lines of sal-like genes with presumably different functions arose from an early evolutionary duplication of a common ancestor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Msal-2 is expressed throughout embryonic development but also in adult tissues, predominantly in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the function of SALL2/Msal-2 still needs to be determined </plain></SENT>
