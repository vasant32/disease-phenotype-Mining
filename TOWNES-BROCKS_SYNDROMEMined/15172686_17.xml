<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SALL1, a causative gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, encodes a zinc finger protein, and its mouse homolog (Sall1) is essential for metanephros development, as noted during gene targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the embryonic kidney, Sall1 is expressed abundantly in mesenchyme-derived structures from condensed mesenchyme, S-, comma-shaped bodies, to renal tubules and podocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We generated mice in which a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was inserted into the Sall1 locus and we isolated the GFP-positive population from embryonic kidneys of these mice by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-activated cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GFP-positive population indeed expressed mesenchymal genes, while the negative population expressed genes in the ureteric bud </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To systematically search for genes expressed in the mesenchyme-derived cells, we compared gene expression profiles in the GFP-positive and -negative populations using microarray analysis, followed by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected many genes known to be important for metanephros development including Sall1, GDNF, Raldh2, Pax8 and FoxD1, and genes expressed abundantly in the metanephric mesenchyme such as Unc4.1, Six2, Osr-2 and PDGFc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found groups of genes including SSB-4, Smarcd3, micro-Crystallin, TRB-2, which are not known to be expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore a combination of microarray technology and Sall1-GFP mice is useful for systematic identification of genes expressed in the developing kidney </plain></SENT>
