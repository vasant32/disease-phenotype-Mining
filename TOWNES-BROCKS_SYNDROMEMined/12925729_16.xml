<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine the effect of losing both of the spalt genes, spalt and spalt-related, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and report defects similar to those in humans with Townes-Brocks' syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of both spalt and spalt-related function in flies yields morphological defects in the testes, genitalia, and the antenna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, spalt/spalt-related mutant antennae show severe reductions in Johnston's organ, the major auditory organ in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological analyses confirm that spalt/spalt-related mutant flies are deaf </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These commonalities suggest that there is functional conservation for spalt genes between vertebrates and insects </plain></SENT>
