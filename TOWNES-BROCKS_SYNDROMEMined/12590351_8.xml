<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three homologues of the Drosophilaregion-specific homeotic gene spalt (sal) have been isolated in zebrafish, sall1a, sall1b and sall3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis of these genes against known salDNA sequences showed zebrafish sall1aand sall1b to be orthologous to other vertebrate sal-1 genes and zebrafish sall3to be orthologous to other vertebrate sal-3 genes, except Xenopus sall3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that zebrafish sall1a and sall1bresulted from a gene duplication event occurring prior to the divergence of the ray-finned and lobe-finned fish lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the expression pattern of the zebrafish sal genes shows that sall1a and sall3 share expression domains with both orthologous and non-orthologous vertebrate sal genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both are expressed in various regions of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, including in primary motor neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outside of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, sall1a expression is observed in the otic vesicle (ear), heart and in a discrete region of the pronephric ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These analyses indicate that orthologies between zebrafish sal genes and other vertebrate sal genes do not imply equivalence of expression pattern and, therefore, that biological functions are not entirely conserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However we suggest that, like other vertebrate sal genes, zebrafish sal genes have a role in neural development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, expression of zebrafish sall1a in the otic vesicle, heart sac and the pronephric ducts of zebrafish embryos is possibly consistent with some of the abnormalities seen in Sall1-deficient mice and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks Syndrome</z:e>, a human disorder which is caused by mutations in the human spalt gene SALL1 </plain></SENT>
