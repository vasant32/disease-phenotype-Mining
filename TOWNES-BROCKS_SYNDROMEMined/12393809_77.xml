<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the reported literature experience, clinical diagnosis of the syndrome can be elusive, owing to the variable presentation in families reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, there is overlap of clinical features with other conditions, most notably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="HOS|HOS1">Holt-Oram syndrome</z:e>, a condition resulting from mutation of the TBX5 locus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, known to be caused by mutations in the SALL1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arising from our observation of several malformations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1623209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DRRS">Okihiro syndrome</z:e> patients which are also described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, we postulated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1623209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DRRS">Okihiro syndrome</z:e> might result from mutation of another member of the human SALL gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the human SALL4 gene on chromosome 20q13.13-q13.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have identified literature reports of forelimb malformations in patients with cytogenetically identifiable abnormalities of this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We here present evidence in 5 of 8 affected families that mutation at this locus results in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1623209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DRRS">Okihiro syndrome</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
