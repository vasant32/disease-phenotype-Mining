<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sall1 is a putative transcription factor that is highly expressed in progenitor cells during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>) is associated with mutations of the SALL1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> is characterized by renal, anal, limb and auditory abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although neural deficits have not been recognized as a diagnostic characteristic of the disease, ~10% of patients exhibit neural or behavioral abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that, in addition to being expressed in peripheral organs, Sall1 is robustly expressed in progenitor cells of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both classical- and conditional-knockout mouse studies indicate that the cerebral cortex is particularly sensitive to loss of Sall1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of Sall1, both the surface area and depth of the cerebral cortex were decreased at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These deficiencies are associated with changes in progenitor cell properties during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In early cortical progenitor cells, Sall1 promotes proliferative over neurogenic division, whereas, at later developmental stages, Sall1 regulates the production and differentiation of intermediate progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Sall1 influences the temporal specification of cortical laminae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings present novel insights into the function of Sall1 in the developing mouse cortex and provide avenues for future research into potential neural deficits in individuals with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
