<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the SALL1 gene revealed that both daughters were heterozygous for nonsense mutation 1256T&gt;A (L419X), that is present 5' to the region encoding the first double zinc finger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mother was heterozygous for the L419X mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The younger daughter is the first patient with a SALL1 mutation to exhibit a classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265240" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="OAVS">Goldenhar syndrome</z:e>-like phenotype with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001140'>epibulbar dermoid</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observation lends further support to the concept that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265240" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="OAVS">Goldenhar syndrome</z:e> is an etiologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder that may have a genetic basis in some cases </plain></SENT>
