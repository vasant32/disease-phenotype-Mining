<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to facilitate functional studies of this gene in a model organism, we searched for the murine homolog of SALL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report the genomic cloning, chromosome mapping, and partial expression analysis of the gene Sall1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparison, Northern blot hybridization as well as the conserved chromosome location on the homologous mouse chromosome indicate that we have indeed isolated the murine homolog of SALL1 </plain></SENT>
