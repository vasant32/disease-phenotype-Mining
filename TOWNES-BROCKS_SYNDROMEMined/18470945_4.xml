<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of these mutations result in premature termination codons that would be predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and cause haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies using a gene targeted mouse model (Sall1-DeltaZn) suggested that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> phenotypes are due to expression of a truncated mutant protein, not haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we strengthen this hypothesis by showing that expression of the mutant protein alone in transgenic mice is sufficient to cause limb phenotypes that are characteristic of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We prove that the same pathogenetic mechanism elucidated in mice is occurring in humans by demonstrating that truncated SALL1 protein is expressed in cells derived from a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> mutant protein is capable of dominant negative activity that results in ectopic activation of two downstream genes, Nppa and Shox2, in the developing heart and limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose a model for the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> in which truncated Sall1 protein causes derepression of Sall-responsive target genes </plain></SENT>
