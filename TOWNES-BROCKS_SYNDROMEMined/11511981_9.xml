<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To begin to understand the role of the Hsal 1 protein (p140) in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and disease pathogenesis, both message and protein expression were evaluated in specific tissues associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence information for Hsal 1 predicts that this homeotic, Drosophila homologue (Sal) encodes a zinc-finger protein consistent with a transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for Hsal 1 was highly expressed in fetal kidney and brain, with detectable production in thymus and heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p140 was found in fetal ureteric bud, fetal and postnatal renal tubular epithelium, and renal blastema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 14-week fetal testis, the Hsal 1 protein was specifically expressed in the <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> producing Leydig cells while in adult gonads Hsal 1 was also found in both Leydig and Sertoli cells, spermatogonia of the testis, and granulosa cells of the ovary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> revealed consistently high expression of the gene product in the epithelial and blastemal components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These spatial and temporal patterns of expression for Hsal 1, and the phenotypic effects associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>, suggest that Hsal 1 plays an important role in the development and functional maintenance of the kidney and gonads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Hsal 1 gene product may play a part in the pathogenesis of specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> occurring in these organs in addition to its specific role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
