<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Penetrance seems to be complete, but there is high inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variation, with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein describe a new multigeneration family with 11 affected individuals (F1), in whom we confirm intra-familial clinical variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000324'>Facial asymmetry</z:hpo>, a clinical feature not highlighted in other ACS reports, was highly prevalent among the patients reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene responsible for ACS is still unknown and its identification will certainly contribute to the understanding of human craniofacial development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No chromosomal rearrangements have been associated with ACS, thus mapping and positional cloning is the best approach to identify this disease gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To map the ACS gene, we conducted linkage analysis in two large ACS families, F1 and F2 (F2; reported elsewhere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Through segregation analysis, we first excluded three known loci associated with disorders of first and second pharyngeal arches (Treacher Collins syndrome, oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, we performed a wide genome search and we observed evidence of linkage to 1p21.1-q23.3 in F2 (LOD max 3.01 at theta=0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this locus was not linked to the phenotype segregating in F1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results led to the mapping of a first locus of ACS (ACS1) and also showed evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>, suggesting that there are at least two loci responsible for this phenotype </plain></SENT>
