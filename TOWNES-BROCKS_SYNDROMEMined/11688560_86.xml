<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SALL1 is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila region-specific homeotic gene spalt (sal); heterozygous mutations in SALL1 in humans lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a mouse homolog of SALL1 (Sall1) and found that mice deficient in Sall1 die in the perinatal period and that <z:mp ids='MP_0000520'>kidney agenesis</z:mp> or severe dysgenesis are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sall1 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme surrounding ureteric bud; homozygous deletion of Sall1 results in an incomplete ureteric bud outgrowth, a failure of tubule formation in the mesenchyme and an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the mesenchyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenotype is likely to be primarily caused by the absence of the inductive signal from the ureter, as the Sall1-deficient mesenchyme is competent with respect to epithelial differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sall1 is therefore essential for ureteric bud invasion, the initial key step for metanephros development </plain></SENT>
