<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes Brocks Syndrome</z:e> is associated with mutations in the SALL1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sall1-deficient animals die at birth due to kidney deficits; however, its function in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system has not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of Sall1 in the developing olfactory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that Sall1 is expressed by cells in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb (OB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sall1-deficient OBs are reduced in size and exhibit alterations in neurogenesis and mitral cell production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the olfactory nerve failed to extend past the ventral-medial region of the OB in Sall1-deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed intrinsic patterns of neurogenesis during olfactory development in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Sall1-mutant animals, these patterns of neurogenesis were disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a role for Sall1 in regulating neuronal differentiation and maturation in developing neural structures </plain></SENT>
