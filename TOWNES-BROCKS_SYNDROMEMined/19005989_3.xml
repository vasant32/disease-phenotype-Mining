<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks Syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> condition characterized by renal, anal, ear and thumb anomalies caused by SALL1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ocular manifestations reported have included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000519'>congenital cataracts</z:hpo>, unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000568'>microphthalmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo>, and unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001088'>Brushfield Spots</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Iris and chorioretinal colobomata were described in one individual whose daughter had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DUS|DURS1">Duane syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: We present a case of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> with a proven SALL1 mutation associated with unique ophthalmic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: The first child of healthy unrelated parents was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy with multiple features consistent with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic SALL1 gene mutation c826C &gt; T (pR276X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The child had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001140'>epibulbar dermoid</z:hpo> and left Type 1 Duane syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He also had tearing when he ate food (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152227" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">crocodile tears</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This case adds to the current knowledge of ophthalmic associations with SALL1 mutations; features characteristic of SALL1 mutations and others more commonly associated with SALL4 mutations (2) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001140'>epibulbar dermoid</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DUS|DURS1">Duane</z:e>) being present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Truncated SALL1 protein alters the localization of full length SALL4 providing a theoretical mechanism for these associations, alternatively SALL1 mutations cause associated eye problems more directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possibility of chance association cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our case is only the second we have found with a SALL1 mutation and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DUS|DURS1">Duane syndrome</z:e> and the first to also have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001140'>epibulbar dermoid</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mutation present is that most commonly associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case increases the demand to examine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> for ophthalmic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
