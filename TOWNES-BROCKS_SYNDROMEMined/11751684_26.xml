<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in SALL1, a gene mapping to 16q12.1, were identified as a cause for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate how SALL1 mutations lead to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>, we have performed a series of functional studies with the SALL1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using epifluorescence and confocal microscopy it could be shown that a GFP-SALL1 fusion protein localizes to chromocenters and smaller heterochromatin foci in transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromocenters consist of clustered pericentromeric heterochromatin and contain telomere sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence revealed a partial colocalization of GFP-SALL1 with M31, the mouse homolog of the Drosophila heterochromatic protein HP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was further demonstrated that SALL1 acts as a strong transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional repression could not be relieved by the addition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">Trichostatin-A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified PIN2, an isoform of telomere-repeat-binding factor 1 (TRF1), as an interaction partner of SALL1, and showed that the N-terminus of SALL1 is not necessary for the interaction with PIN2/TRF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interaction was confirmed in vitro in a GST-pulldown assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association of the developmental regulator SALL1 with heterochromatin is striking and unexpected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results propose an involvement of SALL1 in the regulation of higher order chromatin structures and indicate that the protein might be a component of a distinct heterochromatin-dependent silencing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have also provided new evidence that there is a close functional link between the centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin domains not only in Drosophila and yeast, but also in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
