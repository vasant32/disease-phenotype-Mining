<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, the spalt gene is involved in cell fate determination and pattern formation in different tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have cloned a chick homologue of Drosophila spalt, which we have termed csal1, and this study focuses on the regulation of csal1 expression in the limb bud </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>csal1 is expressed in limb buds from HH 17 to 26, in both the apical ectodermal ridge and the distal mesenchyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signals from the apical ridge are essential for csal1 expression, while the dorsal ectoderm is required for csal1 expression at a distance from the ridge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that both FGF and Wnt signals are required for the regulation of csal1 expression in the limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the human homologue of csal1, termed Hsal1/SALL1, result in a condition known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>), which is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100258'>preaxial polydactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The developmental expression of csal1 together with the digit phenotype in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> patients suggests that csal1 may play a role in some aspects of distal patterning </plain></SENT>
