<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This autosomal dominantly inherited disorder is characterized by typical malformations of the thumbs, the ears, and the anus, and also commonly affects the kidneys and other organ systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SALL1 has recently been shown to localize to chromocenters and other heterochromatin foci in murine fibroblasts and to interact with the telomere-repeat-binding factor TRF1/PIN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2I (UBE2I), the human homolog of S. cerevisiae UBC9, and the small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1) interact with SALL1 in the yeast two-hybrid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction of SALL1 and UBE2I was confirmed in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an in vitro assay, it could be demonstrated that SALL1 is covalently modified by at least two SUMO-1 molecules in the presence of UBA2/AOS1 and UBE2I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation of lysine 1086 of SALL1 to arginine abrogates SALL1 sumoylation, suggesting the presence of a polymeric SUMO-1 chain in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> state </plain></SENT>
