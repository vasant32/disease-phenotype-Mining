<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conserved noncoding genomic sequences are candidate regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we performed a survey for conserved noncoding elements (CNE) nested within the SALL1 gene; mutations in this gene result in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the genomic sequence between humans and chicken revealed five CNE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic fragments corresponding to each CNE were inserted into reporter cassettes consisting of eGFP cDNA and a minimal promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These constructs were electroporated into chick embryos during gastrula, neurula, and pharyngula stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the five CNE that were examined, one 443 bp CNE exhibited tissue-specific enhancer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the neurula stage, the eGFP signal was visualized in the prosencephalon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the pharyngula stage, the eGFP signal was confined within the anterior neural ridge, which represents one of the morphogenetic centers regulating the patterning of the anterior neural plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This report identifies, for the first time, an enhancer element of SALL1 </plain></SENT>
