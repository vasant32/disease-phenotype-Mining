<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene underlying <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>, SALL1, is a human homolog of the Drosophila spalt gene which encodes a transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A search for SALL1 mutations undertaken in 11 unrelated affected individuals (five familial and six <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases) led to the detection of mutations in nine of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One nonsense and six different novel frameshift mutations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> located in the second exon, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together with the previously reported mutations [Kohlhase et al., 1999], they establish that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> results from haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The finding of de novo mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases is consistent with the proposed complete penetrance of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the occurrence of the same 826C&gt;T transition in a CG dimer, in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases from the present series and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases from the other series [Kohlhase et al., 1999] (i.e., six of the eight mutations identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases), reveals the existence of a mutation hotspot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six different SALL1 polymorphisms were identified in the course of the present study, three of which are clustered in a particular region of the gene that encodes a stretch of serine residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the chromosome 16 breakpoint of a t(5;16)(p15.3;q12.1) translocation carried by a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>-affected individual was mapped at least 180 kb telomeric to SALL1, thus indicating that a position effect underlies the disease in this individual </plain></SENT>
