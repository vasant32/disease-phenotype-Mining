<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that mutations in the putative zinc finger transcription factor gene SALL1 cause <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the spectrum of SALL1 mutations and to investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>, we examined 23 additional families with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> or similar phenotypes for SALL1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 of these families mutations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the mutations has previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of these mutations are nonsense mutations, one of which occurred in three unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of the mutations are short deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the mutations are located 5' of the first double zinc finger (DZF) encoding region and are therefore predicted to result in putative prematurely terminated proteins lacking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DZF domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that only SALL1 mutations that remove the DZF domains result in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also present evidence that in rare cases SALL1 mutations can lead to phenotypes similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265240" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="OAVS">Goldenhar syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, phenotypic differences in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> do not seem to depend on the site of mutation </plain></SENT>
