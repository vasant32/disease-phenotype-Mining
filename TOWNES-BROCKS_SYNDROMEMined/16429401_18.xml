<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SALL1 mutations previously found in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> patients create preterminal termination codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the findings of pericentric inversions or balanced translocations, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> was initially assumed to be caused by SALL1 haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This assumption was strongly contradicted by a Sall1 mouse knock-out, because neither hetero- nor homozygous knock-out mutants displayed a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A different mouse mutant mimicking the human SALL1 mutations, however, showed a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>-like phenotype in the heterozygous situation, suggesting a dominant-negative action of the mutations causing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We applied quantitative real time PCR to detect and map SALL1 deletions in 240 patients with the clinical diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>, who were negative for SALL1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletions were found in three families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first family, a 75 kb deletion including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SALL1 exons had been inherited by two siblings from their father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patient carried a de novo 1.9-2.6 Mb deletion including the whole SALL1 gene, and yet another <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case was found to carry an intragenic deletion of 3384 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected persons, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> phenotype is rather mild as compared to the phenotype resulting from point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that SALL1 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to cause a mild <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> phenotype but suggest that it is not sufficient to cause the severe, classical form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It therefore seems that there is a different contribution of SALL1 gene function to mouse and human embryonic development </plain></SENT>
