<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of human SALL1 cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, with features of ear, limb, anal, renal and heart anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sall1, a murine homolog of SALL1, is essential for kidney formation, and both Sall1 and SALL1 localize to heterochromatin in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a molecular mechanism for the heterochromatin localization of Sall1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation analyses revealed that the 7th-10th C-terminal double zinc finger motifs were required for the localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A recombinant protein of the most C-terminal double zinc finger (9th-10th) bound to specific A/T-rich sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Sall1 associated with A/T-rich sequences of the major satellite DNA in heterochromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus Sall1 may bind to A/T-rich sequences of the major satellite DNA via its C-terminal double zinc fingers, thereby mediating its localization to heterochromatin </plain></SENT>
