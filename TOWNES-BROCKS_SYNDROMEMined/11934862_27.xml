<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Drosophila antenna is a highly derived appendage required for a variety of sensory functions including olfaction and audition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate how this complex structure is patterned, we examine the specific functions of genes required for antenna development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nuclear factors, Homothorax, Distal-less and Spineless, are each required for particular aspects of antennal fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of Homothorax, necessary for nuclear localization of its ubiquitously expressed partner Extradenticle, with Distal-less is required to establish antenna fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we test which antenna patterning genes are targets of Homothorax, Distal-less and/or Spineless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report that the antennal expression of dachshund, atonal, spalt, and cut requires Homothorax and/or Distal-less, but not Spineless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Distal-less and Homothorax specify antenna fates via regulation of multiple genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also report for the first time phenotypic consequences of losing either dachshund or spalt and spalt-related from the antenna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We find that dachshund and spalt/spalt-related are essential for proper joint formation between particular antennal segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the spalt/spalt-related null antennae are defective in hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>Hearing defects</z:hpo> are also associated with the human diseases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001171'>Split Hand</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001839'>Split Foot</z:hpo> Malformation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks Syndrome</z:e>, which are linked to human homologs of Distal-less and spalt, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose that there are significant genetic similarities between the auditory organs of humans and flies </plain></SENT>
