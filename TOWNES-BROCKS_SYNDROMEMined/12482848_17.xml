<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, very little is known about the molecular function of spalt proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used biochemical approaches to characterize functional domains of two chick spalt homologs, csal1 and csal3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that csal1 and csal3 proteins repress transcription and that they can interact with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that truncated chick spalt proteins, similar to the truncated spalt protein expressed in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, affect the nuclear localization of full-length spalt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings have implications for the understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> and the role of spalt genes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that truncated spalt can exert a dominant negative effect and is able to interfere with the correct function of full-length protein, by causing its displacement from the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This could affect the transcriptional repressor activity of spalt and DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spalt protein truncations could also affect the function of other spalt family members in various tissues </plain></SENT>
