<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atopy is defined as the genetic propensity to develop immunoglobulin E antibodies in response to exposure to <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> and assessed by skin prick test responses to common <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is generally agreed that atopy is an important risk factor for allergic diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>rhinitis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo>, the extent to which atopy accounts for these diseases is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the prevalence of sensitization to common <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> and investigate the degree of association of atopy (as defined by positive skin prick test to 1 or more common <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi>) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>rhinitis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo> in a birth cohort at the age of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A birth cohort of 1456 children was recruited over a 14-month period (1989-1990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These children have been seen previously at 1 and 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 4 years, 1218 children were reviewed and an interview was administered or postal questionnaire was completed for the presence of allergic diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>rhinitis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in 981 children, skin prick tests with a battery of 12 common <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">Allergens</z:chebi> were house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus), grass pollen mix, cat, dog, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium herbarum, cow's milk, hen's egg, soya, cod, wheat, and peanut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean wheal diameter of at least 3 mm greater than the negative control was taken as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This analysis is confined to the 981 (67% of the original population) who also had skin prick tests to the standard battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>chi(2) tests were used to test the univariate association between each allergic disease and positive skin test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the independent effect of sensitization to each allergen on allergic disease, adjusting for the effect of sensitization to other <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To ascertain how much of allergic disease is attributable to atopy, we estimated the population-attributable risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was calculated with the formula: P(R - 1) where R is the OR for the allergic disease under consideration and P is the proportion of atopy in children with that disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children who were skin prick-tested at 4 years were similar in most characteristics to the rest of the population, except that they had a higher prevalence of allergic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Allergic disorders (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>rhinitis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo>) were present in 276 (28.1%) of 981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One hundred ninety-two (19.6%) children were atopic (positive reaction to 1 or more <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Sensitization to inhalant <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> was relatively common (19.2%) as compared with food <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>House dust mite (11.9%), grass pollen (7.8%), and cat (5.8%) were the most common positive reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A test to the 4 most common <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> (house dust mite, grass pollen, cat, and A alternata) could detect 94% of the atopic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Sensitization to the 4 most common <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> was strongly associated with the presence of allergic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>There was a graded effect with the potent <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi>, such as house dust mite, having the greatest impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>For example, 50% of children sensitized to house dust mite had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> as opposed to 44% sensitized to cat, 42% sensitized to grass pollen, and 32% sensitized to A alternata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Overall, 68.4% of children sensitized to house dust mite had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo>, and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>rhinitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The respective figures for grass pollen, cat, and A alternata were 64.9%, 66.7%, and 57.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The proportion of children sensitized to cat was not higher in households with cat ownership (households with cats: 5.1% [19/374]; households without cats: 6.2% [36/580]; not significant [NS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no difference was seen in sensitization to dog in households with and without dogs (households with dogs: 1.8% [5/282]; households without dogs: 2.8% [19/673]; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Boys were atopic more often than girls at this age (male: 112 of 497 [22.5%] vs female: 80 of 484 [16.5%]; OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.07-2.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Male preponderance was observed with most <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi>, but this was statistically significant only for house dust mite (male: 75/497 [15.1%] vs female: 42/484 [8.7%]; OR: 1.87; CI: 1.25-2.79) and grass pollen (male: 51/497 [10.3%] vs female: 26/484 [5.4%]; OR: 2.01; CI: 1.23-3.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>An independent effect of allergen sensitization on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> was observed only with house dust mite with an OR of 8.07 (CI: 4.60-14.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The highest independent risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>rhinitis</z:mp> was sensitization to grass pollen (OR: 5.02; CI: 2.21-11.41), and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo>, sensitization to peanut (OR: 4.65; CI: 1.02-21.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The majority of children (98/192) were sensitized to &gt;1 allergen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A graded effect was observed with the risk of allergic disease in the child increasing with the number of positive skin prick test reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This effect was consistent throughout the spectrum of allergic diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>rhinitis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
