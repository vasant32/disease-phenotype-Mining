<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SALL1 has recently been found to be mutated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>, OMIM No. 107480) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the isolation and mapping of another sal-like human gene, named SALL1P, on chromosome Xp11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This intronless gene closely resembles SALL1 but displays several mutations, suggesting that SALL1P represents a sal-related pseudogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high similarity of SALL1P to SALL1 is of considerable importance for mutation analysis of SALL1 in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
