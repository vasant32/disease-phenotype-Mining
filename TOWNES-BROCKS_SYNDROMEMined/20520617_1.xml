<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> is caused by mutations in SALL1, a gene mapped to chromosome 16q12.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report three generations of a family with SALL1 c.1326delC (p.Ser442fs) mutation, showing increased clinical severity over generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The members of the first generation demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
