<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We earlier reported that mice deficient in Sall1 die in the perinatal period and that <z:mp ids='MP_0000520'>kidney agenesis</z:mp> or severe dysgenesis are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now generated mice lacking Sall2, another Sall family gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although Sall2 is expressed mostly in an overlapping fashion versus that of Sall1, Sall2-deficient mice show no apparent abnormal phenotypes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking both Sall1 and Sall2 show kidney phenotypes comparable to those of Sall1 knockout, thereby demonstrating the dispensable roles of Sall2 in embryonic and kidney development </plain></SENT>
