<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> has been reported as the presenting feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> on only one occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the SALL1 gene, mutations of which result in the Townes-Brocks phenotype, is expressed in the developing kidney, the absence of other corroborative reports of <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> presenting in affected individuals suggests that the solitary observation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> is as likely due to chance as to causal association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In now reporting a further instance of this association, we review the literature, demonstrating that several other instances of <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> are in fact known, despite an incomplete dataset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> may be a constituent element of the natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> and raise the possible benefits of longitudinal survey for progressive kidney impairment in patients with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
