<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present two patients with de novo, partially cryptic, CCRs that illustrate both the value and limitations of using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) whole chromosome paint probes to characterize these types of rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a patient referred because of features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, G-band analysis revealed an unbalanced CCR involving 3 chromosomes (2,11 and 16) and at least 4 breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A more complex rearrangement involving two cryptic insertions and at least 6 breakpoints, however, was detected using whole chromosome paint probes specific for the 3 chromosomes involved in the rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case, FISH studies were essential for accurate characterization of this patient's rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second patient, G-band analysis revealed that a 12-year-old male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003241'>small genitalia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit disorder</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning disabilities</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior problems</z:e>, carried a CCR involving 4 chromosomes (3, 5, 10 and 13) with 6 breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This rearrangement seemed unbalanced, with missing terminal 3p26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2-pter material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our G-band interpretation of this karyotype was confirmed by FISH using whole chromosome paint probes specific for the involved chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although no evidence of the "missing" 3pter material was observed using a chromosome 3 paint, FISH analysis using a chromosome 3p unique telomere probe identified telomeric 3p material on the distal long arm of the derivative 10 chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the limited value of painting probes to detect small rearrangements, especially those involving terminal chromosome regions </plain></SENT>
