<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SALL1 was originally identified on the basis of its DNA sequence homology to the region-specific homeotic gene Sal, in Drosophila melanogaster, which acts as a downstream target of hedgehog/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> factor-beta-like decapentaplegic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SALL1 gene has been associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks Syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>), a disorder characterized by multiorgan dysgenesis including renal and genital malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, SALL1 message production was evaluated in association with the tissue localization of the protein product of SALL1, p140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SALL1 protein expression was observed in various adult and fetal tissues which elaborate reproductive <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The p140 was localized in specific microanatomic sites of the pituitary, adrenal cortex and the placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the human pituitary, SALL1 protein expression was limited to the adenohypophysis, where it colocalized to those cells producing GH and the gonadotropins, LH and FSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SALL1 expression was also found in most of the fetal and adult adrenal cortex in addition to the trophoblastic cells of the placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pattern of expression complements prior studies demonstrating p140 in testicular fetal Leydig cells, adult Leydig and Sertoli cells, and granulosa cells of the ovary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SALL1 protein was also shown here to be highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041182" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">trophoblast tumors</z:e>, which overproduce sex hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression patterns of SALL1 at multiple levels of the reproductive <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> axis and the phenotypic effects associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> suggest that SALL1 may have an important role in the interaction of the pituitary-adrenal/gonadal axis during reproduction </plain></SENT>
