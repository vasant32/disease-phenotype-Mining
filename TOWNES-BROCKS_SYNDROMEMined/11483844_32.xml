<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the dose-response effect of prenatal alcohol exposure for adverse child behavior outcomes at 6 to 7 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Beginning in 1986, women attending the urban university-based maternity clinic were routinely screened at their first prenatal visit for alcohol and drug use by trained research assistants from the Fetal Alcohol Research Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women reporting alcohol consumption at conception of at least 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/day and a 5% random sample of lower level drinkers and abstainers were invited to participate to be able to identify the associations between alcohol intake and child development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maternal alcohol, cigarette, and illicit drug use were prospectively assessed during pregnancy and postnatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent variable in this study, prenatal alcohol exposure, was computed as the average absolute alcohol intake (oz) per day across pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At each prenatal visit, mothers were interviewed about alcohol use during the previous 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantities and types of alcohol consumed were converted to fluid ounces of absolute alcohol and averaged across visits to generate a summary measure of alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alcohol was initially used as a dichotomous variable comparing children with no prenatal alcohol exposure to children with any exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effects of different levels of exposure, the average absolute alcohol intake was relatively arbitrarily categorized into no, low (&gt;0 but &lt;0.3 fl oz of absolute alcohol/day), and moderate/heavy (&gt;/=0.3 fl oz of absolute alcohol/day) for the purpose of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six years later, 665 families were contacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four percent agreed to testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Exclusions included children who missed multiple test appointments, had major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> (other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FAE|ARBD">fetal alcohol syndrome</z:e>), possessed an IQ &gt;2 standard deviations from the sample mean, or had incomplete data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e>) was used to assess child behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> is a parent questionnaire applicable to children ages 4 to 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is widely used in the clinical assessment of children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior problems</z:e> and has been extensively used in research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Eight syndrome scales are further grouped into Externalizing or undercontrolled (Aggressive and Delinquent) behavior and Internalizing or overcontrolled (Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, and Withdrawn) behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Three syndromes (Social, Thought, and Attention Problems) fit neither group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Higher scores are associated with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">problem behaviors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Research assistants who were trained and blinded to exposure status independently interviewed the child and caretaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on a broad range of control variables known to influence childhood behavior and/or to be associated with prenatal alcohol exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These included perinatal factors of maternal age, education, cigarette, cocaine, and other substances of abuse and the gestational age of the baby </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Postnatal factors studied included maternal psychopathology, continuing alcohol and drug use, family structure, socioeconomic status, children's whole blood lead level, and exposure to violence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Data were collected only from black women as there was inadequate representation of other racial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Frequency distribution, cross-tabulation, odds ratio, and chi(2) tests were used for analyzing categorical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Continuous data were analyzed using t tests, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with posthoc tests, and regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Testing was available for 501 parent-children dyads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Almost one fourth of the women denied alcohol use during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Low levels of alcohol use were reported in 63.8% and moderate/heavy use in 13% of pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Increasing prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with lower birth weight and gestational age, higher lead levels, higher maternal age, and lower education level, prenatal exposure to cocaine and smoking, custody changes, lower socioeconomic status, and paternal drinking and drug use at the time of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Children with any prenatal alcohol exposure were more likely to have higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> scores on Externalizing (Aggressive and Delinquent) and Internalizing (Anxious/Depressed and Withdrawn) syndrome scales and the Total Problem Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of scoring in the clinical range for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0522174" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Delinquent behavior</z:e> was 3.2 (1.3-7.6) in children with any prenatal exposure to alcohol compared with nonexposed controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The threshold dose was evaluated with the 3 prenatal alcohol exposure groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>One-way ANOVA revealed a significant between group difference for Externalizing (Aggressive and Delinquent) and the Total Problem Score </plain></SENT>
