<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hereditary basis has been established for a subset of affected patients, suggesting a major role of developmental genes that are involved in early kidney organogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene mutations that have dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and cause RHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000079'>urinary tract anomalies</z:hpo>, and defined extrarenal symptoms have been identified in TCF2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000107'>renal cysts</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> syndrome), PAX2 (renal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo> syndrome), EYA1 and SIX1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BOR">branchio-oto-renal syndrome</z:e>), and SALL1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For estimation of the prevalence of these events, an unselected cohort of 99 unrelated patients with RHD that was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> were screened for mutations in TCF2, PAX2, EYA1, SIX1, and SALL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations or variants in the genes of interest were detected in 17 (17%) unrelated families: One mutation, two variants, and four deletions of TCF2 in eight unrelated patients; four different PAX2 mutations in six families; one EYA1 mutation and one deletion in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BOR">branchio-oto-renal syndrome</z:e>; and one SALL1 mutation in a patient with isolated RHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000107'>renal cysts</z:hpo>, six (22%) carried a mutation in TCF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that a SIX1 sequence variant was identified in two siblings with renal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo> syndrome as a result of a PAX2 mutation, suggesting an <z:hpo ids='HP_0010983'>oligogenic inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Careful clinical reevaluation that focused on discrete extrarenal symptoms and thorough family analysis revealed syndrome-specific features in nine of the 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 15% of patients with RHD show mutations in TCF2 or PAX2, whereas abnormalities in EYA1, SALL1, and SIX1 are less frequent </plain></SENT>
