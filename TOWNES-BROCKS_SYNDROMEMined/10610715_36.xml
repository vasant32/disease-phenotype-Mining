<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two human sal-like genes have been isolated so far, SALL1 on chromosome 16q12.1 and SALL2 on chromosome 14q11.1-q12.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Truncating mutations of SALL1 have been shown to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> and are thought to result in SALL1 haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparison of SALL1 to the related genes Msal in mouse and Xsal-1 in Xenopus laevis suggested that SALL1 was not the human orthologue of Msal and Xsal-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By database searching and genomic cloning, we isolated an EST and a corresponding human cosmid clone, which contain coding sequence of a human gene highly similar to mouse Msal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This gene, named SALL3, was found to be expressed in different regions of human fetal brain and in different adult human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal localization of SALL3 at 18q23 suggests that haploinsufficiency of this gene might contribute to the phenotype of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">18q deletion syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
