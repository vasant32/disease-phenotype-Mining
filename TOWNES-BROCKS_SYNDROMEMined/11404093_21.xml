<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have analyzed the expression of the mouse homologue of SALL1 (Sall1) during early embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sall1 expression is very prominent in the developing brain and the limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other sites of expression include the meso- and metanephros, lens, olfactory bulbs, heart, primitive streak and the genital tubercle </plain></SENT>
