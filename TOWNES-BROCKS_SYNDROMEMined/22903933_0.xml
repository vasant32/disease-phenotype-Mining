<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ZRS (zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence) is a long-range limb-specific SHH enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several point mutations in the ZRS have been described in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations cause enhanced SHH activity and ectopic anterior expression of SHH and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotype</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100258'>preaxial polydactyly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001199'>triphalangeal thumb</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009777'>Absent thumb</z:hpo> or radius has not been reported with ZRS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on a family with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotype</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100258'>preaxial polydactyly</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0009777'>absent thumb</z:hpo> and radius, with kidney and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The family was screened for SALL1, SALL4, and TBX5 mutations, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, they were screened for ZRS mutations, which showed a novel point mutation within the ZRS, NG_009240.1: g.106954C&gt;T (traditional nomenclature: ZRS619C&gt;T) in the five affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mutation was not previously reported in any public domain database, and was not found in our healthy and ethnically matched control individuals or unaffected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that interactions of SHH and SALL1 explain the overlapping features of the family described here and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
