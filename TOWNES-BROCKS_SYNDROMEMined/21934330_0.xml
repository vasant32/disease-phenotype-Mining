<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sall1 is a transcription factor that best identifies stem cells present in the mouse embryonic kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in Sall1 gene in mice can lead to dysgenesis of kidney, while in humans it results in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, which is associated with the <z:mp ids='MP_0000520'>kidney agenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike the embryonic kidney, Sall1 expression in the adult kidney is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that similar to the embryonic kidney, Sall1 expression can identify stem cells present in the adult kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly in this study, we identified Sall1-expressing cells in the adult mouse kidney, determined their role in kidney regeneration following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury (IRI), and sought the effect of age on Sall1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: By immunofluorescence Sall1-expressing cells were identified in the proximal tubule at the cortico-medullary junction and constituted 0.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tubular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rare Sall1-positive cells were also identified in the outer cortex and distal tubules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sall1 expression was not seen in the glomerular, interstitial, or vascular compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following IRI, 90% of Sall1-expressing cells proliferated and 5% of Sall1-positive cells showed asymmetrical cell division with one of the two adjacent Sall1-positive cells incorporating chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following IRI, there was an increase in Sall1 expression at 4 and 12 h, a decrease at 5 and 10 days, and baseline expression at day 30 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no age-related change in Sall1 expression as determined by qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Sall1-expressing cells are present in the adult mouse kidney, predominantly in the proximal tubules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sall1-expressing cells proliferate following IRI and some of the Sall1-positive cells undergo asymmetrical cell division </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Sall1 is a promising marker for identification of stem cells present in the adult mouse kidney </plain></SENT>
