<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We traced the parental origin of SALL1 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> by analysis of linkage between SALL1 mutations and exonic or intronic polymorphisms in 16 families with 10 different mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations were of paternal origin in 14 of 16 cases (87.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paternal origin was independent of the mutation type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean paternal age at conception was 29.9 and the mean maternal age 26.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that de novo mutations in SALL1 mostly occur on the paternally derived chromosome 16 without an obvious age effect </plain></SENT>
