<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, 36 SALL1 mutations have been described in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but three of those, namely p.R276X, p.S372X, and c.1404dupG, have been found only in single families thereby preventing phenotype-genotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present 20 novel mutations (12 short deletions, five short duplications, three nonsense mutations) in 20 unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We delineate the phenotypes and report previously unknown ocular manifestations, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000519'>congenital cataracts</z:hpo> with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000568'>microphthalmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that 46 out of the now 56 SALL1 mutations are located between the coding regions for the glutamine-rich domain mediating SALL protein interactions and 65 bp 3' of the coding region for the first double zinc finger domain, narrowing the SALL1 mutational hotspot region to a stretch of 802 bp within exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, only two SALL1 mutations would result in truncated proteins without the glutamine-rich domain, one of which is reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter is associated with anal, ear, hand, and renal manifestations, indicating that the glutamine-rich domain is not required for typical <z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
