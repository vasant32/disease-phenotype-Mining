<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SALL1 plays a critical role during kidney development as mutations of the human SALL1 gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e>, which is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000792'>kidney malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the mouse Sall1 gene results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000104'>renal agenesis</z:hpo> or severe dysgenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the regulation of SALL1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report describes the cloning and characterization of the human SALL1 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consensus binding sites were identified for several transcription factors, with multiple sites for WT1 and SIX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In transient transfection assays, SALL1 promoter activity was higher in HEK-293 human kidney cells and COS-7 monkey kidney cells than in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, consistent with its role in kidney development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcription from the SALL1 promoter was strikingly activated by the SIX1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a luciferase reporter gene assay, endogenous or exogenously added SIX1 activated the SALL1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SIX1 induced a significant increase in the endogenous SIX1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, co-expression of SIX1 and Eya1 resulted in a significant increase in the SALL1 promoter activity when compared with either SIX1 or Eya1 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that SIX1 was able to bind to the SALL1 promoter by retardation assays and that deletion of the putative element of SIX1 significantly diminishes the SALL1 promoter activity response to SIX1 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings, when taken together, indicate that SALL1 is a likely target gene for SIX1 during kidney development </plain></SENT>
