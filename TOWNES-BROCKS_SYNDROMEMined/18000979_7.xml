<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular pathophysiology of these mutations is incompletely understood, and many conclusions have been drawn from studies performed in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified truncating mutations in SALL1 and GLI3 in patients with limb malformation and studied the contribution of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) to the expression of mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in patient-derived fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantification of the relative proportions of mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles was performed by pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SALL1, a mutant allele causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265246,C1531578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Townes-Brocks syndrome</z:e> was unexpectedly resistant to NMD, whereas a different mutation causing a much milder phenotype was susceptible to NMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In GLI3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three mutant alleles tested were susceptible to NMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work provides novel insights into the molecular pathophysiology of SALL1 and GLI3 mutations, extends the phenotypic spectrum of SALL1 mutations, and provides an example of a human mutation which does not follow the usual accepted positional rules governing mammalian NMD </plain></SENT>
