<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of exercise in the prevention and management of this disease is evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper briefly reviews the effects of combining aerobic and resistance exercises on glycemic control, and details the training and characteristics of various interventions in adults with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Literature searches were performed using electronic databases between the 1st of January 1950 and the 15th of September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 403 articles retrieved, 28 studies met our inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined exercise protocols seem to improve glycemic control to a greater extent than isolated forms of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, length, duration, intensity, mode, number of exercises, sets and repetitions varied markedly among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Supervised training sessions, recommended structured exercises, and splitting aerobic and resistance training in separate sessions may be relevant for best results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies should analyze the effects of different aerobic and resistance training modes, different training and progression methods, and whether one type of exercise is optimal, as these issues are likely to convey greater knowledge on type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> management through combined exercise </plain></SENT>
