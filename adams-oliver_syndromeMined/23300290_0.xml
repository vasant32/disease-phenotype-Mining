<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A possible correlation between these parameters and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SMI was explored, and anthropometric and metabolic parameters were also analyzed.RESULTSWaist, levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-Î±), HbA(1c), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no statistical differences in hs-CRP and insulin levels were detected when the data were adjusted for waist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of these parameters varied between SMI and non-SMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was impaired and leukocyte-endothelium interactions were more frequent among diabetic patients, which was evident in the lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> consumption, membrane potential, polymorphonuclear cell rolling velocity, and GSH/GSSG ratio, and in the higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species production and rolling flux, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin molecules observed in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these differences correlated with SMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences were maintained after adjusting the data for BMI and waist, with the exception of VCAM-1 levels when adjusted for waist.CONCLUSIONSOxidative stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, and endothelium-inducing leukocyte-endothelium interactions are features of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and correlate with SMI </plain></SENT>
