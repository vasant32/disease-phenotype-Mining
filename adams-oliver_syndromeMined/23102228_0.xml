<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two different types of adipose tissues can be found in humans enabling them to respond to starvation and cold: white adipose tissue (WAT) is generally known and stores excess energy in the form of triacylglycerol (TG), insulates against cold, and serves as a mechanical cushion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) helps newborns to cope with cold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BAT has the capacity to uncouple the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiratory chain, thereby generating heat rather than <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The previously widely held view was that BAT disappears rapidly after birth and is no longer present in adult humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), however, it was recently shown that metabolically active BAT occurs in defined regions and scattered in WAT of the adult and possibly has an influence on whole-body energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals adipose tissue is at the center of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targeting of WAT by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs), activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) a 'master' regulator of fat cell biology, is a current therapy for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since its unique capacity to increase energy consumption of the body and to dissipate surplus energy as heat, BAT offers new perspectives as a therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and associated diseases such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recent discoveries of new signaling pathways of BAT development give rise to new therapeutic possibilities in order to influence BAT content and activity </plain></SENT>
