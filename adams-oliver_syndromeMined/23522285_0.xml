<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> was withdrawn from the market a few years later due to liver toxicity, both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> gained widespread use for T2DM treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2010, however, due to increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with its use, the EMA recommended suspension of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> use and the FDA severely restricted its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> is the only thiazolidinedione still significantly employed for treating T2DM and it is the only molecule of this class still listed in the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>-EASD 2012 Position Statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, as for the other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> is itself limited by several side effects, some of them potentially dangerous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This, together with the development of novel therapeutic strategies approved in the last couple of years, has made it questionable whether or not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>) should still be used in the treatment of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present article will attempt to formulate an answer to this question by critically reviewing the available data on the numerous advantages and the potentially worrying shortcomings of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment in T2DM </plain></SENT>
