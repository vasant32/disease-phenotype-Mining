<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> predisposition at most established susceptibility loci remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KCNQ1 maps within the 11p15.5 imprinted domain, a region with an established role in congenital growth phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variants intronic to KCNQ1 influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility when maternally inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By use of quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of human adult islet and fetal pancreas samples, we investigated the imprinting status of regional transcripts and aimed to determine whether type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk alleles influence regional DNA methylation and gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that gene expression patterns differ by developmental stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDKN1C showed monoallelic expression in both adult and fetal tissue, whereas PHLDA2, SLC22A18, and SLC22A18AS were biallelically expressed in both tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Temporal changes in imprinting were observed for KCNQ1 and KCNQ1OT1, with monoallelic expression in fetal tissues and biallelic expression in adult samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotype at the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variant rs2237895 influenced methylation levels of regulatory sequence in fetal pancreas but without demonstrable effects on gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that CDKN1C, KCNQ1, and KCNQ1OT1 are most likely to mediate <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility at the KCNQ1 locus and identify temporal differences in imprinting status and methylation effects, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk effects may be mediated in early development </plain></SENT>
