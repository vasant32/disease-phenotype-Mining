<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the relationship between serum sclerostin and atherosclerotic disease (AD) in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe performed a cross-sectional study including 78 T2DM patients (45.3% females, mean age 59 ± 5.7 years; 54.7% males, 57.4 ± 6.7 years).RESULTSSerum sclerostin concentrations of T2DM patients in the AD group were significantly higher than in the non-AD group (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each increase of 1 pmol/L in sclerostin level, there was a 4% increase of the risk of AD in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A concentration of ≥42.3 pmol/L showed a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 54.8% to detect an increased risk of AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In males, sclerostin levels were higher in those with AD (P = 0.04), abnormal intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) (P = 0.004), carotid plaques (P &lt; 0.001), and <z:mp ids='MP_0010522'>aortic calcification</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In females, higher levels of sclerostin were related to abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P = 0.03) and <z:mp ids='MP_0010522'>aortic calcifications</z:mp> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the sample size of our study was small, these data suggest that sclerostin levels could be a major modulator of Wnt signaling in AD with implications in T2DM patients </plain></SENT>
