<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 105 subjects including 27 T2DM patients without vascular complications (DM), 28 T2DM patients with vascular complications (DC), 25 elderly healthy volunteers (older) and 25 younger healthy volunteers (younger) were recruited into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid-femoral PWV was measured using an automatic device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum lactadherin, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and TNFα were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PWV and lactadherin, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and TNFα were significantly higher in DM and DC groups than those of older and younger groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWV and lactadherin were higher in older group than those of younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, lactadherin was significantly correlated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, TNFα, PWV, HbA1c and 2 h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P2hBG) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, the independent determinants of lactadherin were HbA1c, P2hBG and age (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore that lactadherin is correlated with poor blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic vascular complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
