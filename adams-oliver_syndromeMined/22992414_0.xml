<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> causes features of metabolic dysfunction in the adipose tissue that may contribute to later impairments of insulin action in skeletal muscle and liver; these include reduced insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport, reduced expression of GLUT4, altered expression of adipokines, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006094'>adipocyte hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animal studies have shown that expansion of adipose tissue alone is not sufficient to cause systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in the absence of adipose tissue metabolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine if this holds true for humans, we studied the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and markers of adipose tissue dysfunction in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 32 non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> first-degree relatives of Type 2 diabetic patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was determined by an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and insulin sensitivity was measured with the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies obtained for gene/protein expression and adipocyte cell size measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings show that also in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals low insulin sensitivity is associated with signs of adipose tissue metabolic dysfunction characterized by low expression of GLUT4, altered adipokine profile and enlarged adipocyte cell size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this group, insulin sensitivity is positively correlated to GLUT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (R = 0.49, p = 0.011) and protein (R = 0.51, p = 0.004) expression, as well as with circulating adiponectin levels (R = 0.46, 0 = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, insulin sensitivity is inversely correlated to circulating RBP4 (R = -0.61, 0 = 0.003) and adipocyte cell size (R = -0.40, p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these features are inter-correlated and also associated with other clinical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association could be found between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>-associated adipocyte dysregulation and HIF-1alpha in this group of non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these findings support the concept that it is not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> per se, but rather metabolic dysfunction of adipose tissue that is associated with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
