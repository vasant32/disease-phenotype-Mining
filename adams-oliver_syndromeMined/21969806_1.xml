<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study aimed to analyze the relationship of morning plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels with body mass index (BMI) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample frame was the "Offspring of individuals with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> study" database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 358 offspring of individuals with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and 287 individuals without a known family history of T2DM were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects who were â‰¥10 years of age were selected from the database for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with T2DM were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent a 75 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), and blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, ACTH, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were estimated from the fasting sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-five participants (305 males [62%] and 190 females [38%]) were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACTH and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels were higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-weight subjects than in overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both ACTH and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> increased as fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in offspring of T2DM subjects with MS than in offspring of T2DM subjects without MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for BMI, the significance was marginal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In males, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels were negatively correlated with early insulin secretion during OGTT (insulinogenic index [0-30]) and positively with waist circumference and serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In females, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and systolic blood pressure were significantly and positively correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Body weight was correlated negatively with morning plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and ACTH, whereas fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was correlated positively </plain></SENT>
