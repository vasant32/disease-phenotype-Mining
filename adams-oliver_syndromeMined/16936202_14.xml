<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic overlap between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> makes USF1 a compelling positional candidate for the widely replicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> linkage signal on chromosome 1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We typed 22 variants in the F11R/USF1 region (1 per 3 kb), including those previously implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e>-susceptibility (or proxies thereof) in 3,726 samples preferentially enriched for 1q linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-related continuous traits in an overlapping set of 1,215 subjects of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no convincing evidence for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in any of seven case-control comparisons, individually or combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family-based association analyses in 832 Pima subjects were similarly negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At rs3737787 (the variant most strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FCHL</z:e>), the combined odds ratio, per copy of the rarer A-allele, was 1.10 (95% CI 0.97-1.24, P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 124 Utah subjects, rs3737787 was significantly associated (P = 0.002) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, but direction of this association was opposite to previous reports, and there was no corroboration in three other samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data exclude USF1 as a major contributor to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility and the basis for the chromosome 1q linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They reveal only limited evidence for replication of USF1 effects on continuous metabolic traits </plain></SENT>
