<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of canagliflozin were evaluated in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, subjects (N = 584) received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) at week 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c &lt; 7.0%; change from baseline in fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG), 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>) and systolic blood pressure (BP); and percent change in body weight, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At week 26, HbA1c was significantly reduced from baseline with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg compared with placebo (-0.77, -1.03 and 0.14%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both canagliflozin doses significantly decreased FPG, 2-h <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53262">PPG</z:chebi>, body weight and systolic BP (p &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), and increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> compared with placebo (p &lt; 0.01 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall incidences of AEs were modestly higher with canagliflozin versus placebo; rates of serious AEs and AE-related discontinuations were low and similar across groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Canagliflozin treatment improved glycaemic control, <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced body weight</z:mp> and was generally well tolerated in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
