<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Prevalence of Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> among Sudanese population was found to be 3.4% and associated with high rates of complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different adipocytokines are secreted from adipose tissues, among them adiponectin, which was shown to have insulins ensitizing properties and anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Sudanese diabetic subjects and controls in respect to hormones influencing or influenced by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 104 type 2 diabetic patients (45 men and 59 women), and 75 matched control subjects (34 men and 41 women) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum samples were used to measure adiponectin, leptin, insulin, proinsulin, ghrelin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body mass index, insulin/proinsulin ratio and (HOMA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and beta cell function were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adiponectin serum concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with controls subjects (P = 0.002), comparison between males and females did not reach significant levels in both diabetic (P = 0.06) or controls (P = 0.16) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the diabetic group adiponectin correlated positively with serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, negatively with serum proinsulin and HOMA beta cell function (P = 0.03) respectively and serum ghrelin (P = 0.003), but not with BMI, HOMA <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, insulin or leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In controls serum adiponectin correlated negatively with BMI (P = 0.002) but not with other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that, adiponectin concentrations independent on BMI as a measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, were mostly linked to insulin sensitivity and not to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in Sudanese type 2 diabetic subjects, where race specific regulation mechanisms or different type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> phenotype suggested being a major contributory factor in clarification the findings of this study </plain></SENT>
