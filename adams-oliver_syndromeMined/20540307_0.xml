<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1996 to 2008, 6 infants with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0007385'>scalp defects</z:hpo> were treated with dressing change, flap transposition, or tissue expansion combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defect</z:hpo> reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Parietal <z:hpo ids='HP_0007385'>scalp defects</z:hpo> in 6 cases were healed after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5 cases were followed up for 3 months to one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 cases had scalp <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> in some areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scar was inconspicuous in the other 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dressing change is suitable for small <z:hpo ids='HP_0007385'>scalp defect</z:hpo>, while flap transposition should be used for medium defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For large full-thickness cranial defect, dressing change and tissue expansion should be performed at the first stage, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defect</z:hpo> reconstruction and expanded flap transposition </plain></SENT>
