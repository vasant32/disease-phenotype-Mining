<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the efficacy, safety and dose-response relationship of once-daily teneligliptin, a novel DPP-4 inhibitor, in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) inadequately controlled with diet and exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, patients (n=324) were randomized to receive teneligliptin 10, 20 or 40 mg, or placebo, once daily before breakfast for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb)A1c from baseline to Week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> teneligliptin-treated groups showed significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) than the placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences between the teneligliptin 10, 20 or 40 mg groups and the placebo group for the change in HbA1c were -0.9 [least-squares (LS) mean; 95% confidence interval: -1.0, -0.7], -0.9 (-1.1, -0.7) and -1.0 (-1.2, -0.9)%, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The respective LS means for FPG were -17.8 (-23.4, -12.1), -16.9 (-22.6, -11.2) and -20.0 (-25.7, -14.3) mg/dL (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in HbA1c between the three doses of teneligliptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions was similar in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> was not significantly different among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with teneligliptin for 12 weeks provided significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and FPG across the dose range studied and was generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
