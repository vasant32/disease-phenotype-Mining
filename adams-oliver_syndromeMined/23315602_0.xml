<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the influence of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control on skeletal complications.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSData of 4,135 participants of the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort, were available (mean follow-up 12.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 420 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were classified by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (according to HbA(1c) calculated from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi>), resulting in three comparison groups: adequately controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (ACD; n = 203; HbA(1c) &lt;7.5%), inadequately controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>; n = 217; HbA(1c) â‰¥7.5%), and no <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 3,715) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Models adjusted for sex, age, height, and weight (and femoral neck BMD) were used to test for differences in bone parameters and fracture risk (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]).RESULTSThe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group had 1.1-5.6% higher BMD, 4.6-5.6% thicker cortices, and -1.2 to -1.8% narrower femoral necks than ACD and ND, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> had 47-62% higher fracture risk than individuals without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 1.47 [1.12-1.92]) and ACD (1.62 [1.09-2.40]); whereas those with ACD had a risk similar to those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (0.91 [0.67-1.23]).CONCLUSIONSPoor glycemic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with fracture risk, high BMD, and thicker femoral cortices in narrower bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We postulate that fragility in apparently "strong" bones in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> can result from microcrack accumulation and/or cortical porosity, reflecting impaired bone repair </plain></SENT>
