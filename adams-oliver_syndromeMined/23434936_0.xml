<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Glucagon is important for maintaining euglycemia during fasting/starvation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003565'>abnormal glucagon secretion</z:mp> is associated with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; however, the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-induced glucagon secretion are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that global deletion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2(-/-)) in mice impaired glucagon secretion from isolated islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, UCP2 may contribute to the regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>-induced glucagon secretion, which is supported by our current finding that UCP2 expression is increased in nutrient-deprived murine and human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further to this, we created α-cell-specific UCP2 knockout (UCP2AKO) mice, which we used to demonstrate that blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> recovery in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is impaired owing to attenuated glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UCP2-deleted α-cells have higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), due to enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> coupling, which translated into defective stimulus/secretion coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of UCP2 deletion were mimicked by the UCP2 inhibitor genipin on both murine and human islets and also by application of exogenous ROS, confirming that changes in oxidative status and electrical activity directly reduce glucagon secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, α-cell UCP2 deletion perturbs the fasting/hypoglycemic glucagon response and shows that UCP2 is necessary for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> α-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing and the maintenance of euglycemia </plain></SENT>
