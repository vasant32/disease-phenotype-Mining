<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 35,247 male participants of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were dentate, free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline, were followed from 1986 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">tooth loss</z:e> and potential confounders were collected at baseline and biennially through mailed questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The multivariable adjusted relationships between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and first report of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">tooth loss</z:e> were estimated using time-varying Cox models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3009 incident self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and 10,017 tooth loss events over 591,941 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Men with T2DM showed a 29% (HR=1.29; 95% CI: 1.13-1.47) increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> compared to those without, when adjusted for age, race, smoking, BMI, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption and dental profession </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men with T2DM with total fruit and vegetable intake&lt;median were 49% as likely to report incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> compared to those without T2DM (HR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.23-1.80; p-value for interaction=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multivariable adjusted risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">tooth loss</z:e> was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02-1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was associated with a significantly greater risk of self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
