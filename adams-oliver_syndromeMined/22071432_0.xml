<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to ascertain the construct validity of self-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control in a population-based survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study assessed 1848 participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who took part in the Montreal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Health and Wellbeing Study in Quebec, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were administered the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications index as well as sociodemographic and health questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fair/poor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control was associated with being less likely to check blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> weekly, being less likely to drink alcohol, being more likely to report being physically inactive, reporting fair/poor eating habits, being <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and having 1 or more <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables were included in a regression model the two variables most strongly associated with poor fair/poor <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control were reporting fair/poor eating habits (odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.00-1.85) and having 2 or more <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications (odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.06-2.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that self-rated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control has associations with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific self-care behaviours and outcomes, and is a general indicator of self-care and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications in a population-based survey </plain></SENT>
