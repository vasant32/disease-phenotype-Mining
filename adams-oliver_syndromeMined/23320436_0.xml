<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial in 425 Asian patients with inadequately controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were randomized into three groups: 50 mg gemigliptin qd, 25 mg gemigliptin bid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg qd added to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> treatment for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">Haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) were measured periodically, and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests were performed at baseline and 24 weeks after starting the treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four weeks later, adding gemigliptin (50 mg/day) to ongoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy significantly improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction in HbA1c caused by 50 mg gemigliptin qd (-0.77% ± 0.8) was non-inferior to that caused by 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> qd (-0.8% ± 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7% while taking 25 mg gemigliptin bid (50%) or 50 mg gemigliptin qd (54.07%) was comparable to the results with 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> qd (48.87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant decreases in FPG, postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and AUC(0-2 h) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, as well as increases in GLP-1 and β cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (supported by homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function, postprandial 2-h c-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and insulinogenic index) in patients receiving gemigliptin treatment with their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no increased risk of adverse effects with this dose of gemigliptin compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100 mg qd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of gemigliptin 50 mg daily to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was shown to be efficacious, well tolerated and non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
