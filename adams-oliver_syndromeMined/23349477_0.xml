<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8386">pregnane</z:chebi> X receptor (PXR), along with its sister receptor constitutive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstane</z:chebi> receptor (CAR), was initially characterized as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> receptor that regulates drug metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have uncovered an unexpected endobiotic role of PXR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PXR ablation inhibited high fat diet (HFD)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, which were accounted for by <z:mp ids='MP_0005289'>increased oxygen consumption</z:mp>, increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Î²-oxidation, inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and sensitization of insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an independent model, introducing the PXR-/- allele into the ob/ob background also improved body composition and relieved the diabetic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ob/ob mice deficient of PXR showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005289'>increased oxygen consumption</z:mp> and energy expenditure, as well as inhibition of gluconeogenesis and increased rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal during euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, the metabolic benefits of PXR ablation were associated with the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and down-regulation of lipin-1, a novel PXR target gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The metabolic benefit of PXR ablation was opposite to the reported pro-diabetic effect of CAR ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results may help to establish PXR as a novel therapeutic target, and PXR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may be used for the prevention and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
