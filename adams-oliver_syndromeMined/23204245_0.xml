<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treated with oral medications, completed a set of medication adherence self-reports that varied response scales and time frames, were administered structured clinical interviews for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and provided blood samples for HbA1c as part of a screening for an intervention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subsample of participants with HbA1c ≥7.0% and clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> received Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) bottle caps to record adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses examined relationships between adherence measures and HbA1c and, in the subsample, MEMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderated linear regression evaluated whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> severity modified relationships with HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Participant (n = 170, 57% men, 81% white, mean HbA1c 8.3% [SD, 1.7]) adherence self-reports were significantly (r = -0.18 to -0.28; P &lt; 0.03) associated with lower HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subsample (n = 88), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> self-reports were significantly (r = 0.35 to 0.55; P ≤ 0.001) associated with MEMS-measured adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> significantly moderated the relationship between three of six self-reports and HbA1c; at high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, associations with HbA1c became nonsignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Results support the validity of easily administered self-reports for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-month, percentage-based ratings of adherence had the strongest associations with MEMS and HbA1c; those requiring the report of missed doses had weaker associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-week self-ratings and measures that require respondents to record the number of missed doses appear to be vulnerable to bias from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
