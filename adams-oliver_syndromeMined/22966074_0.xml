<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk gene TCF7L2 is the effector of the Wnt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found previously that in gut <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> L-cell lines, TCF7L2 controls transcription of the proglucagon gene (gcg), which encodes the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas peripheral GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion, brain GLP-1 controls energy homeostasis through yet-to-be defined mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine the metabolic effect of a functional knockdown of TCF7L2 by generating transgenic mice that express dominant-negative TCF7L2 (TCF7L2DN) specifically in gcg-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gcg-TCF7L2DN transgenic mice showed reduced gcg expression in their gut and brain, but not in pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defects in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis were observed in these mice, associated with attenuated plasma insulin levels in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The defect in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal was exacerbated with high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain Wnt activity and feeding-mediated hypothalamic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) repression in these mice were impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peripheral injection of the cAMP-promoting agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> increased brain Î²-cat Ser675 phosphorylation and brain gcg expression and restored feeding-mediated hypothalamic AMPK repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TCF7L2 and Wnt signaling control gut and brain gcg expression and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis and speculate that positive cross-talk between Wnt and GLP-1/cAMP signaling is an underlying mechanism for brain GLP-1 in exerting its metabolic functions </plain></SENT>
