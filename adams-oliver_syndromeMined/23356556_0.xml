<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> following oral administration of 10, 25 or 100 mg doses once daily over 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 78 patients were assigned to empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 16), 25 mg (n = 16) or 100 mg (n = 30) or placebo (n = 16) for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessments included adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Empagliflozin exposure increased dose-proportionally over the dose range 10-100 mg and showed linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion (UGE) increased from baseline to day 1 by 74, 90 and 81 g with empagliflozin 10, 25 and 100 mg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increases in UGE were maintained over 28 days with multiple dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Virtually no change in UGE was observed in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions from baseline in mean daily plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were observed with empagliflozin compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AEs was similar in the empagliflozin and placebo groups (50.0, 56.3 and 66.7% with empagliflozin rising doses and 62.5% with placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported AEs were <z:mp ids='MP_0011535'>pollakiuria</z:mp> (10.3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nasopharyngitis</z:e> (9.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> (9.0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of empagliflozin at doses of 10, 25 or 100 mg once daily over 28 days resulted in significant increases in UGE and reductions in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> compared with placebo, and were well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
