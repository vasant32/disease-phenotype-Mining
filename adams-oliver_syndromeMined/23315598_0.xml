<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were evident at the time that fetal growth-restricted offspring were born.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe carried out a case-control study of men who fathered pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction, in the absence of recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015929" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal disease</z:e> (n = 42), compared with men who fathered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-birth weight offspring (n = 77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mothers were healthy, nonsmoking, and similar in age, BMI, ethnicity, and parity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 4 weeks of offspring birth, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fathers had measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA index), blood pressure, waist circumference, endothelial function (flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>), <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, weight, and smoking habit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made using multivariable logistical regression analysis.RESULTSFathers of fetal growth-restricted offspring [mean (SD) 1.8th (2.2) customized birth centile] were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and to smoke cigarettes compared with fathers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> grown offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariable analysis, paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and smoking remained different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with fathers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> grown offspring, men who fathered pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction had an OR 7.68 (95% CI 2.63-22.40; P &lt; 0.0001) of having a 1-unit higher log HOMA-IR value and 3.39 (1.26-9.16; P = 0.016) of being a smoker.CONCLUSIONSMen who recently fathered growth-restricted offspring have preclinical evidence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome and are more likely to smoke than fathers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> grown offspring </plain></SENT>
