<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Exenatide twice daily is a first-in-class glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> approved for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the safety profile of exenatide twice daily and to compare its profile with that of a pooled comparator (placebo and insulin) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 19 completed, randomized, controlled clinical trials of exenatide twice daily (5 μg and 10 μg) were pooled and analyzed; the pooled data included 5594 intent-to-treat patients who were followed for 12-52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates, exposure-adjusted incidence rates, and 95% confidence intervals around risk differences between groups were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline demographics and exposure time were comparable between groups (exenatide, N = 3261; pooled comparator, N = 2333; mean exposure time 166-171 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient, mild- to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> was the most frequent adverse event with exenatide (36.9% versus 8.3% in the pooled comparator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (minor or major) with concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (exenatide 26.5%, pooled comparator 20.7%) was higher than that without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> (exenatide 3.1%, pooled comparator 2.7%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events, discontinuations due to serious adverse events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported with similar frequency in the exenatide and pooled comparator groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Composite exposure-adjusted incidence rates were not statistically different between groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, or major adverse cardiac events; there was a difference in incidence rates for benign thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (0.3% versus 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, this analysis, representing over 1500 patient-years of exposure, demonstrated that exenatide twice daily was safe and generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of most adverse events, including serious adverse events, was similar in both exenatide-treated and comparator-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most distinct differences between groups were in gastrointestinal-related adverse events, which is consistent with other therapies within the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> class </plain></SENT>
