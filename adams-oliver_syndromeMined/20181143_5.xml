<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is recognized that the growing epidemic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> is related to dietary and lifestyle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate short-term application of nutritional counseling in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This follow-up study was conducted from September to November 2008 with thirty three women &gt; or =35 years old screened clinically for nutritional counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake was reported, and biochemical and body composition measures were taken at baseline and after three months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 33 women evaluated, 29 patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was high at 38%, 72.4%, 55.2%, and 75.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of three-months of follow-up, a significant decline in body mass index, waist circumference, triceps skinfold, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> was observed, as was an increase in calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multiple regression analysis showed that changes in body mass index, triceps skinfold, waist circumference and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels after nutritional intervention were positively associated with changes in anthropometric (loss of body weight) and biochemical (decrease of TG/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c ratio) parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, waist circumference changes were negatively associated with changes in calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short-term nutritional counseling improved some factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increases in calcium and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> consumption can be associated with the improvement in markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
