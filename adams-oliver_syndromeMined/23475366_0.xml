<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of ER stress to pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that increased chaperone capacity protects beta cells from ER stress and dysfunction caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and improves overall <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We generated a mouse model that overproduces the resident ER chaperone GRP78 (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein 78 kDa) in pancreatic beta cells under the control of a rat insulin promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mice were subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 20 weeks and metabolic variables and markers of ER stress in islets were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As expected, control mice on the HFD developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GRP78 transgenic mice tended to be leaner than their non-transgenic littermates and were protected against development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and ER stress in islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, islets from transgenic mice had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> insulin content and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of cell-surface GLUT2 (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter 2) and the transgenic mice were less hyperinsulinaemic than control mice on the HFD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data show that increased chaperone capacity in beta cells provides protection against the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-induced type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by maintaining pancreatic beta cell function, which ultimately improves whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
