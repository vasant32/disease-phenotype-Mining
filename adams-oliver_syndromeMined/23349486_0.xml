<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a relationship between ATM content and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> has not been clearly established in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> attenuate adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and improve insulin sensitivity, we examined the temporal relationship of the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on these two parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of 10 and 21 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment on insulin sensitivity in 26 diabetic subjects was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because chemoattractant factors, cytokines, and immune cells have been implicated in regulating the recruitment of ATMs, we studied their temporal relationship to changes in ATM content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity was seen after 21 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found early reductions in macrophage chemoattractant factors after only 10 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, followed by a 69% reduction in ATM content at 21 days and reduced ATM activation at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although markers for dendritic cells and neutrophils were reduced at both time points, there were no significant changes in regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with an association between adipose macrophage content and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
