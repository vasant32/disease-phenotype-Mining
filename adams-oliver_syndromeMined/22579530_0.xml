<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total 605 subjects were included in this study: 403 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 202 non-diabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SNP rs805304 and rs2272592 in DDAH2 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the association of SNP rs805304 and rs2272592 in DDAH2 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SNP rs2272592 was significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P&lt;0.001) while SNP rs805304 was not (P=0.716) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that the prevalence of the AG+GG genotypes were significantly greater than AA homozygotes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (AA vs AG+GG; OR 20.74, 95% CI 6.48-66.35, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significance was maintained after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> and BUN (OR 21.03, 95% CI 2.83-151.14, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both SNP rs805304 and rs2272592 in DDAH2 were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we found that SNP rs2272592 in DDAH2 is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but SNP rs805304 in DDAH2 is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DDAH2 SNP rs2272592 AG+GG genotypes are associated with genetic susceptibility to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Korean population </plain></SENT>
