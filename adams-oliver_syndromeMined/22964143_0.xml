<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among pregnant women, 2 to 17.8% develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy can also occur in women with preexisting <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, that can predispose the fetus to many alterations in organogenesis, growth restriction and the mother to some <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related complications like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> or accelerate the course of these complications if they are already present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> generally start their treatment with diet and lifestyle modification; when these changes fail in keeping an optimal glycemic control, then insulin therapy must be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in use of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> are advised to change to insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with preexisting type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> must start an intensive glycemic control, preferably before conception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these procedures are performed aiming to keep glycemic levels <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> as possible to avoid the occurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes to the mother and to the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to reinforce the need to improve the knowledge on reproductive health of women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during gestation and to understand what are the reasons for them failing to attend for prepregnancy care programs, and to understand the underlying mechanisms of adverse fetal and maternal outcomes, which in turn may lead to strategies for its prevention </plain></SENT>
