<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1C (A1C) level of 6.5% has been included as a criterion for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis by the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine appropriate A1C cutoff values for identifying patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> among Korean adults and to determine whether these cutoffs vary according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recruited 4616 adults without a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 10 university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 75-g OGTT and A1C sampling were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examinees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pointwise area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the A1C cutoff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An A1C threshold of 6.1% proved to be the optimal limit for diagnosing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with 63.8% sensitivity and 88.1% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value increased with age (5.9% in 18-39 years, 6.2% in 40-64 years, and 6.4% in older than 65 years) and were similar for men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An A1C cutoff of 5.7% had reasonable sensitivity (48.6%) and specificity (65.7%) for the identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies should be carried out to determine whether the application of age-specific diagnostic criteria is appropriate </plain></SENT>
