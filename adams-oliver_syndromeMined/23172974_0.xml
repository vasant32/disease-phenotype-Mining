<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Moderately elevated iron stores below the levels commonly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> have been implicated in the etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that iron status (measured by serum ferritin) differs significantly according to sex, but inconsistent findings have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to test the association between serum ferritin and the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations in a population-based, multiethnic, cross-sectional study including men and women of African Surinamese, South Asian Surinamese, and ethnic Dutch origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed data on 508 ethnic Dutch, 597 African Surinamese, and 339 South Asian Surinamese aged 35-60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level ≥7.0 mmol/L or a self-reported diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Serum ferritin was positively associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but differences in the associations according to sex were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin concentration was positively associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among women in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnic groups (odds ratio [OR] ethnic Dutch: 1.07 [95% CI 1.01-1.13]; OR South Asian Surinamese: 1.05 [1.00-1.10]; OR African Surinamese: 1.05 [1.01-1.10]), but not among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin was also more strongly associated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the magnitude of sex differences in the association between serum ferritin and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but not type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, was more pronounced in the African Surinamese group than in the other ethnic groups (P for interaction ≤0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS We found a positive association between serum ferritin and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in our multiethnic population, which appeared stronger among women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of the variation in sex differences between ethnic groups is warranted, particularly among the African Surinamese, to understand the mechanisms behind these sex differences </plain></SENT>
