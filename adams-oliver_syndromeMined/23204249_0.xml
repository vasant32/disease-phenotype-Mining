<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using a laser Doppler velocimetry system, we obtained the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blood flow (RBF) values by simultaneously measuring the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel diameter and blood velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if the RBF is affected in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, we also evaluated the renal function using the estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by age and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS We recruited 169 eyes of 169 consecutive Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, no or minimal diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and normo/<z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (mean age ± SD, 59.0 ± 11.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into four groups based on the stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) (non-CKD, n = 99; CKD stage 1, n = 22; stage 2, n = 27; stage 3, n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found significant (P = 0.035) decreases in RBF with decreased vessel diameter (P = 0.017) but no difference in blood velocity (P = 0.54) in stage 3 CKD compared with the non-CKD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that the CKD stage was significantly (P = 0.02) and independently associated with decreased RBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Our results indicated that the vessel diameter and RBF in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arterioles decrease in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with stage 3 CKD, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> might be associated with decreased RBF, probably via constriction of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arterioles, in early-phase diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
