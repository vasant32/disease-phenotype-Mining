<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of early dramatic improvement in glycemia on <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> disease in poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective, case-control study in public hospital patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who had annual <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> imaging as part of a case management program or standard <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients included had ≥2 two <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> images ≥1 one year apart, and at least 3 HbA1C measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> images were graded using a modified Scottish Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> grading scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An 'intensive' group (n=34) with HbA1C decrease &gt;1.5% was compared with randomly chosen patients (n=34) with minimal HbA1C changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean HbA1C (±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) over two years was similar in intensive (8.5±0.21%) and control groups (8.1±0.28%, p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the intensive group had higher baseline HbA1C and a mean maximal decrease of 4.0±0.41% in contrast to the control group (0.2±0.11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> grade progressed +0.7±0.25 units from baseline in the intensive group (p=0.015), a 22.6% worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The control group changed minimally from baseline (0.03±0.14 units, p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> grade was significantly different between groups (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More eyes worsened by ≥1 retinal grade (p=0.0025) and developed sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (p=0.003) in the intensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> significantly worsened in poorly controlled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after early intensification of glycemic control and dramatic HbA1C change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> status should be part of risk-factor evaluation in patients likely to experience marked reductions in HbA1C in poorly controlled <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
