<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There is a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and low cardiorespiratory fitness in nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a population with risk factors for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM), before they are insulin resistant, we investigated low exercise capacity (VO2max) as an early marker of impaired insulin sensitivity in order to determine earlier interventions to prevent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome (IRS) and T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of data on 369 (78 men and 291 women) people at risk for IRS and T2DM, aged 45.6 +/- 10 years (20-65 years) old from the Community <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Prevention Project in Minnesota were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) by respiratory gas exchange and bicycle ergometer were measured in our at risk non insulin resistant population and compared with a control group living in the same geographic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups were equally sedentary, matched for age, gender and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most prevalent abnormality in the study population was markedly low VO2max when compared with general work site screening control group, (n = 177; 137F; 40 M, mean age 40 +/- 11 years; BMI = 27.8 +/- 6.1 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals at risk for IRS and T2DM had a VO2max (22 +/- 6 ml/kg/min) 15% lower than the control group VO2max (26 +/- 9 ml/kg/min) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was foun that VO2max was inversely correlated with HOMA-IR (r = -0.30, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased VO2max is correlated with impaired insulin sensitivity and was the most prevalent abnormality in a population at risk for IRS and T2DM but without overt disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility that decreased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> max is among the earliest indicators of IRS and T2DM therefore, an important risk factor for disease progression </plain></SENT>
