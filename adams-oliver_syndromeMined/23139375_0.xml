<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using records of 106,640 patients in Scotland, we investigated the association between BMI recorded around the diagnosis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for age and smoking status, with BMI 25 to &lt;30 kg/m(2) as a referent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> within 2 years of BMI determination were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or the end of 2007 was 4.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS A total of 9,631 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred between 2001 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the reference group, mortality risk was higher in patients with BMI 20 to &lt;25 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio 1.22 [95% CI 1.13-1.32] in men, 1.32 [1.22-1.44] in women) and patients with BMI â‰¥35 kg/m(2) (for example, 1.70 [1.24-2.34] in men and 1.81 [1.46-2.24] in women for BMI 45 to &lt;50 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular mortality was higher for each 5-kg/m(2) increase in BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2) by 24% (15-35%) in men and 23% (14-32%) in women, but was lower below this threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were similar after further adjustment for HbA1c, year of diagnosis, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, blood pressure, and socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Patients categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> with T2DM within a year of diagnosis of T2DM exhibit variably higher mortality outcomes compared with the overweight group, confirming a U-shaped association of BMI with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> interventions reduce mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> T2DM patients requires study </plain></SENT>
