<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Within the context of a large, nationwide outcomes research program in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, we assess the prevalence of self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> and evaluate its impact on quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study involved 1,460 patients enrolled by 114 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> outpatient clinics and 112 general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire investigating their ability to achieve and maintain an erection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various aspects of quality of life were also assessed depressive using the following instruments: SF-36 Health Survey, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> health distress, psychological adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, depressive symptoms (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D scale), and quality of sexual life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 34% of the patients reported frequent erectile problems, 24% reported occasional problems, and 42% reported no erectile problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for patient characteristics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> was associated with higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific health distress and worse psychological adaptation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which were, in turn, related to worse metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erectile problems were also associated with a dramatic increase in the prevalence of severe depressive symptoms, lower scores in the mental components of the SF-36, and a less satisfactory sexual life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 63% of the patients reported that their physicians had never investigated their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>Erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> is extremely common among type 2 diabetic patients and is associated with poorer quality of life, as measured with generic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-specific instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite their relevance, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> are seldom investigated by general practitioners and specialists </plain></SENT>
