<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 120 patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and echocardiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doppler echocardiographic indices including peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (e') and early diastolic myocardial velocity (E) were obtained in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were divided into three groups based on the presence and severity of DR: no DR (n=80), simple DR (n=20), and preproliferative or proliferative DR (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients showed systolic impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF&gt;50%), whereas impaired LV diastolic function (E/e'&gt;8) occurred in 104 cases (87%) and LVDD (E/e'&gt;15) was detected in 19 cases (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>E/e' was correlated with age, sex, diabetic duration, DR stage, systolic blood pressure, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, age (β=0.322, p&lt;0.001) and DR stage (β=0.266, p=0.002) were independently correlated with E/e' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study show that almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects had asymptomatic LVDD and that the severity of DR was associated with LVDD in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
