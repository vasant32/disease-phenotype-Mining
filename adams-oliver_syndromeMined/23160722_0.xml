<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Interpopulation as well as interindividual variations in response to <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake commonly observed in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may be related to genetic makeup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the candidate genes potentially responsible for this diversity is <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the interactive effect of VDR Fok-I polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake on diverse aspects of diabetic host response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Glycemic status, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles, inflammatory biomarkers, and VDR Fok-I genotypes were determined in diabetic subjects (n = 140) who participated in a randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants consumed two 250-mL bottles per day of yogurt drink (doogh) fortified with 500 IU <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>/250 mL for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Mean serum 25(OH)D increased by ~30 nmol/L (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time × intervention effect was significant for 25(OH)D (P = 0.030), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (P = 0.011), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (P &lt; 0.001), interleukin (IL)-4 (P = 0.008), and IL-6 (P = 0.017) among the genotypic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alleles were defined as ''F'' or ''f'' depending on the absence or presence of the restriction site, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The least increment in 25(OH)D was in ff (23.0 ± 3.8 nmol/L) compared with Ff (31.2 ± 3.4 nmol/L) and FF (35.6 ± 2.7 nmol/L) (P for trend = 0.009), but only the difference between ff and FF was significant (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FF group had the largest decrement of both hsCRP and IL-6 compared with Ff (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.038) and ff (P = 0.010 and P = 0.048), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS We concluded that those of VDR ff genotype may be regarded as "low responders" to <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> intake in terms of response of circulating 25(OH)D and certain inflammatory biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A nutrigenetic approach may, therefore, be needed to protect diabetic patients from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
