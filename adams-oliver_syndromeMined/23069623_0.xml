<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in epigenetic regulation are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that are often linked with defects in oxidative metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated the potential of class-specific synthetic inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases (HDACs), central chromatin-remodeling enzymes, to ameliorate metabolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cultured myotubes and primary brown adipocytes treated with a class I-specific HDAC inhibitor showed higher expression of Pgc-1α, increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis, and augmented oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic mice with a class I- but not a class II-selective HDAC inhibitor enhanced oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and promoted energy expenditure, thus reducing body weight and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects can be ascribed to increased Pgc-1α action in skeletal muscle and enhanced PPARγ/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1α signaling in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo ChIP experiments indicated that inhibition of HDAC3 may account for the beneficial effect of the class I-selective HDAC inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that class I HDAC inhibitors may provide a pharmacologic approach to treating type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
