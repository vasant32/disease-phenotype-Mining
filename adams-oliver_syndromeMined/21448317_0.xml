<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, TRC150094 induced a significant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration as well as an increased FAO in liver and skeletal muscle, ultimately resulting in reduced hepatic as well as total body fat accumulation, as evaluated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively </plain></SENT>
