<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on evidence that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM), <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant individuals, and lean insulin-resistant offspring of parents with T2DM have âˆ¼30% less mitochondria in their muscles than lean control subjects, it appears to be widely accepted that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> "deficiency" is responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proposed mechanism for this effect is an impaired ability to oxidize fat, resulting in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation in muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this counterpoint article is to review the evidence against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> deficiency concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This evidence includes the findings that 1) development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in laboratory rodents fed high-fat diets occurs despite a concomitant increase in muscle mitochondria; 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> deficiency severe enough to impair fat oxidation in resting muscle causes an increase, not a decrease, in insulin action; and 3) most of the studies comparing fat oxidation in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals have shown that fat oxidation is higher in T2DM patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant individuals than in insulin-sensitive control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it seems clear, based on this evidence, that the 30% reduction in muscle content of mitochondria in patients with T2DM is not responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
