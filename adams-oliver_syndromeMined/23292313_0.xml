<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Abundance of miR-21 was examined in diabetic kidneys from db/db mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic potential of miR-21 in diabetic kidney injury was examined in db/db mice by an ultrasound-microbubble-mediated miR-21 small hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the role and mechanisms of miR-21 in diabetic renal injury were examined in vitro under diabetic conditions in rat mesangial and tubular epithelial cell lines by overexpressing or downregulating miR-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In db/db mice, a mouse model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, renal miR-21 at age 20 weeks was increased twofold compared with db/m (+) mice at the same age, and this increase was associated with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003985'>renal fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More importantly, gene transfer of miR-21 knockdown plasmids into the diabetic kidneys of db/db mice at age 10 weeks significantly ameliorated <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003985'>renal fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at age 20 weeks, revealing a therapeutic potential for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> by targeting miR-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of miR-21 in kidney cells enhanced, but knockdown of miR-21 suppressed, high-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced production of fibrotic and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Targeting Smad7 may be a mechanism by which miR-21 regulates renal injury because knockdown of renal miR-21 restored Smad7 levels and suppressed activation of the TGF-β and NF-κB signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of miR-21 might be an effective therapy for diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
