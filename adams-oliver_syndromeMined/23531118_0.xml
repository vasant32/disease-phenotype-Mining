<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin versus glipizide in elderly patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) over 1 year of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of elderly T2DM patients (aged 65-90 years) with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> on diet/exercise therapy alone (glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> [HbA1c] 6.5%-9.0%) or plus oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> monotherapy (HbA1c 6.5%-8.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to once-daily alogliptin 25 mg or glipizide 5 mg titrated to 10 mg, if needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>Hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> were systematically captured under predefined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the primary analysis, HbA1c mean changes from a baseline of 7.5% were -0.14% with alogliptin (n = 222) and -0.09% with glipizide (n = 219) at study end, demonstrating noninferiority of alogliptin to glipizide (least squares [LS] mean difference = -0.05%; 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI]: - ∞, 0.13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More clinically relevant HbA1c reductions occurred among patients who completed the study: -0.42% and -0.33% with alogliptin and glipizide, with noninferiority again confirmed (LS mean difference = -0.09%; 1-sided 97.5% CI: - ∞, 0.07%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, alogliptin was safe and well tolerated, with notably fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> than glipizide (5.4% [31 episodes] vs. 26.0% [232episodes], respectively); 3 patients experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with glipizide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alogliptin also resulted in favorable weight changes versus glipizide (-0.62 vs. 0.60 kg at week 52; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alogliptin monotherapy maintained glycemic control comparable to that of glipizide in elderly patients with T2DM over 1 year of treatment, with substantially lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
