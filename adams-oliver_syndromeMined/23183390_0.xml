<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare the feasibility of high intensity interval exercise (HI-IE) versus moderate intensity continuous exercise (MI-CE) in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D), and to investigate the preliminary efficacy of HI-IE and MI-CE for improving glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) and body composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals with T2D were recruited and randomly assigned to HI-IE and MI-CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exercise training was performed 5 days per week for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recruitment, retention, adherence, feeling states and self-efficacy were analyzed for feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in HbA1c and percent body fat from baseline were investigated at 12 weeks to determine the preliminary efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 126 participants showing interest to join the study, 15 individuals were randomized and completed the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No participants dropped out from the study after enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adherence rates were high and did not differ between HI-IE and MI-CE (p&gt;0.05; &gt;97.2% of the eligible exercise sessions for both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Feeling states and self-efficacy did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Percent trunk fat decreased in both HI-IE and MI-CE (p=0.007 and 0.085, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total percent body fat, percent leg fat, and subcutaneous fat width were significantly reduced in both groups (p&lt;0.05), whereas HbA1c did not change from baseline (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The degree of improvement was similar between the interventions (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In individuals with T2D, implementing a 12-week structured HI-IE training can be as feasible as MI-CE training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both interventions are equally effective in lowering total body fat but have little impact on HbA1c in relatively well controlled participants with T2D </plain></SENT>
