<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE Patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) are at increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, largely as a result of defective production of cardioprotective nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and a concomitant rise in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dietary interventions that could reverse this trend would be extremely beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation positively affected platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-redox imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We randomized hypertensive T2DM patients (T2DM HT; n = 22) and age-and-sex matched hypertensive study participants without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HT alone; n = 23) in a double-blind, crossover fashion to receive 8 weeks of n-3 PUFAs (1.8 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.5 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi>) or identical olive oil capsules (placebo), with an intervening 8-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> were measured and compared before and after treatment; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> was determined by ELISA and subcellular compartmentalization of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase subunit p47-phox examined by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The n-3 PUFA supplementation reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> levels in platelets from T2DM HT, but not HT alone, participants, without effect on <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This coincided with a significant decrease in p47-phox membrane localization and a similar reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> to that achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, a subcohort of T2DM HT and HT alone participants showed evidence of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS)-derived <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, indicating defective enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was reversed significantly in T2DM HT participants after treatment, demonstrating improved NOS function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Our finding that n-3 PUFAs diminish platelet <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production in T2DM HT patients in vivo suggests a therapeutic role for these agents in reducing the vascular-derived <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
