<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study reports data from two ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants with known risk factors were recruited from primary care practices located within the East Midlands, UK, over the period 2010-2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers (15 s epochs) were used to assess sedentary time (&lt;25 counts per 15 s), MVPA (≥488 counts per 15 s) and total physical activity (total counts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A break was considered as any interruption in sedentary time (≥25 counts per 15 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression examined the independent association of sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, MVPA and total physical activity with markers of cardiometabolic health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample comprised 878 participants; 153 from Project STAND (Sedentary Time And <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp>) (age 32.9 ± 5.6 years, 28.8% male) and 725 from Walking Away from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (age 63.7 ± 7.8 years, 64.8% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following adjustment for various covariates, including MVPA and BMI, there were detrimental linear associations of sedentary time with 2 h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (standardised beta coefficient) (β = 0.220, p &lt; 0.001), triacylglycerol (β = 0.206, p = 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (β = -0.123, p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Breaks in sedentary time, total physical activity and MVPA were significantly inversely associated with measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, but not with any other cardiometabolic variables after adjustment for sedentary time and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In adults at high risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, time spent sedentary is strongly and adversely associated with cardiometabolic health and may be a more important indicator of poor health than MVPA </plain></SENT>
