<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum cathepsin S, insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp), and insulin secretion (early insulin response during an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test) were measured in 905 participants of the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (mean age, 71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty participants developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 6 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, anthropometric variables, and inflammatory markers, higher cathepsin S was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (regression coefficient per SD increase -0.09 [95% CI -0.14 to -0.04], P = 0.001), but no association with early insulin response was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, higher cathepsin S was associated with a higher risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio per SD increase 1.48 [1.08-2.01], P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cathepsin S activity appears to be involved in the early dysregulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin metabolism </plain></SENT>
