<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 2000 to 2006, we prospectively identified 470 matched incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> case-control pairs in the Nurses' Health Study, for whom levels of plasma fetuin-A, alanine transaminase (ALT), and Î³-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment for covariates, including ALT and GGT, the odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) comparing extreme fetuin-A quintiles was 1.81 (1.07-3.06) (P for trend = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mediational analysis showed that this positive association was largely (79.9%) explained by fasting insulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) levels; after further adjustment of these factors, the OR (95% CI) comparing extreme quintiles was attenuated to 1.09 (0.56-2.10) (P for trend = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, liver enzymes did not modify this association (P for interaction = 0.91 for ALT and 0.58 for GGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When results from this study were pooled with those in three prior prospective investigations of the same association, a consistent, positive association was observed between high fetuin-A levels and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk: the relative risk (95% CI) comparing high versus low fetuin-A levels was 1.69 (1.39-2.05) (P for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that plasma fetuin-A levels were independently associated with higher risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
