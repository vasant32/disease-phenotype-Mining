<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HbA1c variability was measured as the intraindividual SD of 4.52 Â± 0.76 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (DR) was assessed by dilated funduscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) was defined based on <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp>, as measured by immunonephelometry or immunoturbidimetry, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>.RESULTSMedian and interquartile range of average HbA1c (HbA1c-MEAN) and HbA1c-SD were 7.57% (6.86-8.38) and 0.46% (0.29-0.74), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, macroalbuminuria, reduced eGFR, albuminuric CKD phenotypes, and advanced DR was observed when both HbA1c parameters were above the median and the lowest when both were below the median </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses showed that HbA1c-SD adds to HbA1c-MEAN as an independent correlate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and stages 1-2 CKD and is an independent predictor of macroalbuminuria, reduced eGFR, and stages 3-5 albuminuric CKD, whereas HbA1c-MEAN is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The opposite was found for DR, whereas neither HbA1c-MEAN nor HbA1c-SD affected nonalbuminuric CKD.CONCLUSIONSIn patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HbA1c variability affects (albuminuric) CKD more than average HbA1c, whereas only the latter parameter affects DR, thus suggesting a variable effect of these measures on microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
