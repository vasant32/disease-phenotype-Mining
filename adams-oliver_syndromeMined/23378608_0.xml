<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, induction of vessel abnormality by adipokines has been well studied, whereas how altered vascular function promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is relatively unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, surviving Prox1 heterozygous mice showed abnormal lymphatic patterning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, indicating that accumulation of adipocytes could be closely linked with lymphatic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we propose a new anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> strategy based on enhancement of lymphatic and blood vessel integrity with apelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apelin-knockout mice given a high-fat diet showed an <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> phenotype associated with abnormal lymphatic and blood vessel enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fatty acids present in the high-fat diet induced hyperpermeability of endothelial cells, causing adipocyte differentiation, whereas apelin promoted vascular stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment of high-fat-diet-fed apelin-knockout mice with a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50629">cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, improved vascular function, and also attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, apelin transgenic mice showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003758'>decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue</z:hpo> owing to inhibition of high-fat-diet-induced hyperpermeability of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that apelin inhibits high-fat-diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> by enhancing vessel integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apelin could serve as a therapeutic target for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and related diseases </plain></SENT>
