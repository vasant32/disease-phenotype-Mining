<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used general linear models to examine the association between each baseline characteristic and weight change at the 2-year visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We fit a linear regression of change in weight and A1C and used general linear models to examine the association between each medication at baseline and weight change at the 2-year visit, stratified by glycemia allocation.RESULTSThere was significantly more <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> in the intensive glycemia arm of the trial compared with the standard arm (3.0 ± 7.0 vs. 0.3 ± 6.3 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, younger age, male sex, Asian race, no smoking history, high A1C, baseline BMI of 25-35, high waist circumference, baseline insulin use, and baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> use were independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduction of A1C from baseline was consistently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> only when baseline A1C was elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medication usage accounted for &lt;15% of the variability of weight change, with initiation of thiazolidinedione (TZD) use the most prominent factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intensive participants who never took insulin or a TZD had an average <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of 2.9 kg during the first 2 years of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intensive participants who had never previously used insulin or TZD but began this combination after enrolling in the ACCORD trial had a <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> of 4.6-5.3 kg at 2 years.CONCLUSIONSWeight gain in ACCORD was greater with intensive than with standard treatment and generally associated with reduction of A1C from elevated baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initiation of TZD and/or insulin therapy was the most important medication-related factor associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
