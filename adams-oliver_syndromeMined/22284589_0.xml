<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>Erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> is a common problem in type 2 diabetic patients who are at higher risk of cerebrovascular events, and it's recorded with sildenafil, a drug which is primarily used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis whether or not sildenafil modulates cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 35 male participants were enrolled; eighteen with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> matched with seventeen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonographic examination (TCD) was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants to insonate the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) through a trans-temporal window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVR was assessed by using breath holding (BH)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> (HV) test, before and after oral 50 mg sildenafil; recordings were analyzed by using SPSS program version 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, sildenafil did not result in statistically significant change in breath holding index (BHI) from 0.91 ± 0.11 to 0.81 ± 0.09 and full range of vasodilatation (FVD) from (59.4% ± 6.3%) to (53.7% ± 4.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diabetic patients, giving sildenafil resulted in significant increase in BHI (from 0.74 ± 0.14 to 1.03 ± 0.14) and FVD (from 60.2% ± 4.96% to 74% ± 4.8%), (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sildenafil significantly improves CVR in type 2 diabetic patients but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
