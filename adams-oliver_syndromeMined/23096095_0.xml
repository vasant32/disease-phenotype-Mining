<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 372 patients with LADA (205 men and 167 women; median age 54 years, range 35-80 years) from Swedish cohorts from Skåne (n = 272) and Västerbotten (n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-matched patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on the use of oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs), insulin and insulin-OHA combination therapy was retrieved from the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poor glycaemic control was defined as HbA(1c) ≥7.0% (≥53 mmol/mol) at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The individuals with LADA and with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed for an average of 107 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LADA patients were leaner than type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients at diagnosis (BMI 27.7 vs 31.0 kg/m(2); p &lt; 0.001) and follow-up (BMI 27.9 vs 30.2 kg/m(2); p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with LADA had been treated with insulin for longer than those with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (53.3 vs 28.8 months; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the patient groups with regard to poor glycaemic control at diagnosis, but more patients with LADA (67.8%) than type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (53.0%; p���&lt; 0.001) had poor glycaemic control at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with LADA had worse glycaemic control at follow-up compared with participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2, 2.7), adjusted for age at diagnosis, HbA(1c), BMI at diagnosis, follow-up time and duration of insulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Individuals with LADA have worse glycaemic control than patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> despite a longer time on insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
