<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible relationship between PAF and SIRT1 pathways in EPCs during altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SIRT1 and PAF receptor (PAF-R) levels were determined by western blot, RT-PCR and confocal laser-scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In-vivo experiments were performed on 48 type 2 diabetic patients (25 with poor glycaemic control and 23 with good glycaemic control) and 20 control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-vitro experiments with the PAF-R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CV3988 were performed on EPCs isolated from leucocyte-rich buffy coat of healthy human donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Decreased SIRT1 protein levels were observed in EPCs from type 2 diabetic patients compared with control individuals (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, the SIRT1 level was consistently lower in patients with poor glycaemic control than in those with good glycaemic control (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients also showed an upregulation of PAF-Rs; this response occurred to a greater extent in individuals with poor glycaemic control than in those with good glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-vitro experiments confirmed that EPCs respond to PAF stimulation with decreased SIRT1 protein and SIRT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, reduction of SIRT1 levels and activity were abolished by CV3988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings unveil a link between PAF and SIRT1 pathways in EPCs that contributes to the deleterious effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> on the functional properties of EPCs, crucial in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and peripheral vascular complications </plain></SENT>
