<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explain these observations, we have proposed a mechanism whereby the activation of a highly energetic process (Ca/metabolic coupling process [CMCP]) by Ca mediates the stimulation of ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to test whether impairment of the CMCP could play a role in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi>- and Ca-mediated changes in OCR and ISR in isolated islets were compared with the time course of changes of plasma insulin concentrations observed during the progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in a rat model of type-2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (the University of California at Davis type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> [UCD-T2DM] rat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Islets were isolated from UCD-T2DM rats before, 1 week, and 3 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> stimulation of cytosolic Ca and OCR was similar for islets harvested before and 1 week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a loss of decrement in islet OCR and ISR in response to Ca channel blockade coincided with decreased fasting plasma insulin concentrations observed in rats 3 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that phenotypic impairment of diabetic islets in the UCD-T2DM rat is downstream of Ca influx and involves unregulated stimulation of the CMCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The continuously elevated levels of CMCP induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in these islets may mediate the loss of islet function </plain></SENT>
