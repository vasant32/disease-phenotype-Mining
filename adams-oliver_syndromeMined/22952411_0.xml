<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of DPP-4 increases the levels of the incretin hormones glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> by preventing their degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the role of linagliptin as an oral once-daily treatment for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the term "linagliptin." Original research articles and review articles were included in our examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linagliptin has a similar mode of action as other gliptins, with comparable efficacy, safety profile, and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in pharmacokinetic parameters that distinguish linagliptin from other gliptins include that linagliptin is not renally excreted and does not require dose reduction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Linagliptin is an oral, once-daily, antihyperglycemic agent that significantly reduces glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) when used alone or in combination with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics, such as the lack of renal excretion, distinguishes linagliptin from other gliptins </plain></SENT>
