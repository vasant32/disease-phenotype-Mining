<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 diabetic patients with renal structural abnormalities and/or non-diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> were recruited and HNF-1β mutation was screened by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three heterozygous missense mutations including c.494G&gt;A (p.R165H), c.662A&gt;T (p.D221V) and c.780G&gt;C (p.E260D) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and mild decline of renal function were observed in the mutation carriers during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The p.R165H mutation carrier had severe β-cell dysfunction and different extrapancreatic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and normoglycemics, the p.R165H mutation carrier had a lower basal C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (0.30, 0.61±0.07 and 0.50±0.04 nmol/L for p.R165H, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and normoglycemics, respectively) and low values of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response to arginine (0.15, 0.48±0.18 and 0.76±0.08 nmol/L for p.R165H, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and normoglycemics, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with the HNF-1β mutation in our population can have different pancreatic and extrapancreatic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exact contributions of mutations to the phenotypes await functional confirmation </plain></SENT>
