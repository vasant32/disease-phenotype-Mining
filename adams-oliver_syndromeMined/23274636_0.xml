<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AOS">Adams-Oliver syndrome</z:e> is a condition mainly characterized by the congenital absence of skin, known as "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> cutis" which is usually limited to the vertex scalp and transverse limb defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 17-day-old term female neonate was referred to us with an infected scalp lesion of the vertex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion which is about 10 Ã— 9 cm had signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with necrotic eschar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We started the neonate on systemic parenteral antibiotics with local dressings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 3 of conservative management, the neonate had exsanguination due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the midline with severe hemodynamic compromise requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After controlling the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> with local tamponade and resuscitating the child, she was taken for early surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Debridement and bipedicled rotation flap of the scalp to cover the raw area was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 18, the flap started showing signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neonate was taken up for debridement, and subsequently, maternal allograft of split-thickness skin was placed as a temporary wound cover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the wound showed progressive epithelialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, the patient continued to have a non-healing area, which was later successfully covered with a split-thickness skin graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We plan to revaluate the need for cranioplasty at around 3-4 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We discuss the dilemmas and challenges involved in the successful management of a neonate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AOS">Adams-Oliver syndrome</z:e> with infected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> cutis and an episode of life-threatening exsanguination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>Aplasia</z:mpath> cutis is a rare developmental anomaly usually involving the calvarium, associated with defective formation of the scalp to a varying extent and severity, requiring various timely strategies </plain></SENT>
