<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to collect and compare the incidence of recorded macro- and microvascular events in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with insulin aspart or regular human insulin in general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Computerized data from 3154 aspart and 3154 regular insulin users throughout Germany (Disease Analyzer, January 2000 to July 2011) were analysed after matching for age (60 ± 10 years), sex (men: 57%), health insurance (private: 5.8%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment period in practice (2.2 ± 2.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HR; Cox regression) for macro- or microvascular outcomes (follow-up: 3.5 years) were further adjusted for diabetologist care, practice region, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, co-medication (basal insulin, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetics</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agents and antithrombotic drugs), previous treatment with rapid-acting insulins, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and the Charlson co-morbidity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, adjustment was carried out for baseline microvascular complications when analysing macrovascular outcomes and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the risk of combined macrovascular outcomes was 15% lower for insulin aspart users (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For insulin aspart there was also a decreased risk incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> [HR: 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45-0.74], <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.54-0.88) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69-0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For microvascular complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>), no significant differences were observed (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.87-1.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart was associated with a reduced incidence of macrovascular outcomes in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important to confirm this finding in a randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
