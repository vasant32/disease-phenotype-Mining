<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was less prevalent in studies of the offspring of centenarians and a separate study of nonagenarian siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether this reduction would also be found when less extreme criteria of parental longevity (a lifespan of at least 80 years) were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we looked for an association between parental longevity and incidence of dysglycaemia, which has not yet been reported for a population-based study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline and 7-year follow-up data on 55-74-year-old participants in the population-based German Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4/F4 cohort study were used for the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants whose parents had died from traumatic causes were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was assessed by validated physician diagnosis or OGTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression models, adjusted OR and 95% CIs were calculated for the associations between parental longevity and the prevalence or incidence of dysglycaemia, which was defined as including either type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> (defined in this study as comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> [IGT] and impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> [IFG]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In age- and sex-adjusted models, the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was lower in individuals with one (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43, 0.93) or two (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25, 0.85) long-lived parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among participants with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at baseline, the odds of incident dysglycaemia were lower in those with one (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40, 1.03) or two long-lived parents (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22, 0.96) after adjustment for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study showed that longevity of the parents, defined by a lifespan of at least 80 years, was associated with a lower prevalence and incidence of dysglycaemia in their offspring in an older German population </plain></SENT>
