<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is considered an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and some studies observed through neuropsychological tests that cognitive disfunction affects both elderly and younger patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate the cognitive status of outpatients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to evaluate factors associated with impaired function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a group of type 2 diabetic outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were asked to undergo the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) during routine ambulatory visits between April 2006 and January 2007, with the highest pontuation of the test being 30 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as having possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> according to years of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, illiteracy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results are presented as median (interquartile range) or mean +/- SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group was composed of 346 type 2 diabetic outpatients (216 females), aged 58,6 +/- 12,1 years and with duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of 12,3 +/- 9,1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 77,2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total MMSE score achieved was 26 points (16 - 30) and was correlated with years of study (R2 = 0,39, p &lt; 0,001) and 'per capita' income (R2 = 0,22, p &lt; 0,0001) and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (R2 = - 0,13, p = 0,01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who needed help to take their medications obtained worst performance in the MMSE (23,16 +/- 3,55 vs 25,7 +/- 2,84, p &lt; 0,01) and were more likely to present possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0,01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty two subjects (12.1%) had diagnosis of possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and this was also associated with years of study (p = 0,045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and total MMSE scores with A1C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should be regularly evaluated for their cognitive function, because duration of disease could be associated with decline in cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The early implementation of mini mental which is a simple method of execution can be done to detect early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This test could be an important tool to access the ability of patient to understand their disease and treatment </plain></SENT>
