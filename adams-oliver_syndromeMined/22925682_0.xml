<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Preliminary data from randomized trials with metabolic outcomes have shown that treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) could be associated with a reduced incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present meta-analysis is aimed at verifying this protective effect, collecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available data from randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive search for published and unpublished trials with a duration â‰¥24 weeks comparing DPP4i with placebo or other drugs was performed, retrieving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MACE reported as serious adverse events together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mantel-Haenzel odds ratio (MH-OR) was calculated with random effect models for MACE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When available, effects on glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and blood pressure were also assessed and used for the estimation of the modification of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> using the UKPDS risk engine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 70 trials, enrolling 41 959 patients with a mean follow-up of 44.1 weeks, was collected and included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MH-OR (95% Confidence Interval) was 0.71[0.59;0.86], 0.64[0.44;0.94], 0.77[0.48;1.24] and 0.60[0.41;0.88] for MACE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DPP4i reduces the risk of cardiovascular events (particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is greater than what predicted on the basis of conventional risk factors, suggesting a role for other mechanisms </plain></SENT>
