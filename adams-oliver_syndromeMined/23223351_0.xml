<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated 1,116 participants in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (IRAS) Family Study with baseline examinations from 2000 to 2002 and follow-up examinations from 2005 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (SI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR), and MCRI were determined at baseline from frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCRI was calculated as the ratio of the insulin dose over the incremental area under the curve of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was defined as fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> â‰¥126 mg/dL or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> medication use by self-report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS We observed that SI and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were independent positive correlates of MCRI, whereas fasting insulin, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and AIR were independent negative correlates (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 5 years of follow-up, 71 (6.4%) participants developed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower MCRI was associated with a higher risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after adjusting for demographics, lifestyle factors, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, indexes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>, and insulin secretion (odds ratio 2.01 [95% CI 1.30-3.10], P = 0.0064, per one-SD decrease in loge-transformed MCRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Our data showed that lower MCRI predicts the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
