<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-intensity exercise (HIE) protocols vary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximal cycle ergometer sprint interval training typically requires only 2.5 minutes of HIE and a total training time commitment (including rest and warm up) of 25 minutes per session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of brief high-intensity exercise on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels of people with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HIE (≥80% maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max) studies with ≤15 minutes HIE per session were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six studies of nondiabetics (51 males, 14 females) requiring 7.5 to 20 minutes/week of HIE are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two weeks of sprint interval training <z:mp ids='MP_0002891'>increased insulin sensitivity</z:mp> up to 3 days postintervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve weeks near maximal interval running (total exercise time 40 minutes/week) improved BG to a similar extent as running at 65% VO2max for 150 minutes/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight studies of diabetics (41 type 1 and 22 type 2 subjects) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six were of a single exercise session with 44 seconds to 13 minutes of HIE, and the others were 2 and 7 weeks duration with 20 and 2 minutes/week HIE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With type 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, BG was generally higher during and up to 2 hours after HIE compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With type 1 diabetics, BG decreased from midnight to 6 AM following HIE the previous morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a single session improved postprandial BG for 24 hours, while a 2-week program reduced the average BG by 13% at 48 to 72 hours after exercise and also increased GLUT4 by 369% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Very brief HIE improves BG 1 to 3 days postexercise in both diabetics and non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HIE is unlikely to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> during and immediately after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Larger and longer randomized studies are needed to determine the safety, acceptability, long-term efficacy, and optimal exercise intensity and duration </plain></SENT>
