<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and transverse limb deficiency can be classified as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527388" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amniotic band</z:e> sequence or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AOS">Adams-Oliver syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and distal transverse limb deficiency to support the hypothesis that these should be considered part of one group of disorders, and highlight the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable severity</z:hpo> of the clinical and neuroradiological phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome abnormalities were excluded by copy number analysis on 250K SNP microarray data.Research done on limb deficiency as on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> caused by mutations in known genes, suggests the involvement of vascular developmental pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of limb deficiency and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> may have a common causative mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition and grouping of patients with this combination of abnormalities will help elucidating the cause </plain></SENT>
