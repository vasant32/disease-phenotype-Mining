<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether validated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and/or glycaemic trait loci are associated with insulin clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps were performed in two Hispanic-American family cohorts totalling 1329 participants in 329 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Metabochip was used to fine-map about 50 previously identified loci for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, 2 h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This resulted in 17,930 variants, which were tested for association with clamp-derived insulin clearance via meta-analysis of the two cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the meta-analysis, 38 variants located within seven loci demonstrated association with insulin clearance (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The top signals for each locus were rs10241087 (DGKB/TMEM195 [TMEM195 also known as AGMO]) (p = 4.4 × 10(-5)); chr1:217605433 (LYPLAL1) (p = 3.25 × 10(-4)); rs2380949 (GLIS3) (p = 3.4 × 10(-4)); rs55903902 (FADS1) (p = 5.6 × 10(-4)); rs849334 (JAZF1) (p = 6.4 × 10(-4)); rs35749 (IGF1) (p = 6.7 × 10(-4)); and rs9460557 (CDKAL1) (p = 6.8 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: While the majority of validated loci for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits do not appear to influence insulin clearance in Hispanics, several of these loci do show evidence of association with this trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that these loci could have pleiotropic effects on insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and insulin clearance </plain></SENT>
