<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published primary research on the development or validation of risk scores that require only self-reported or available clinical data to identify undiagnosed Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic literature search of Medline and EMBASE was conducted until January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies focusing on the development or validation of risk scores to identify undiagnosed T2DM were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk scores to predict future risk of T2DM were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included; 17 developed a new risk score, 14 validated existing scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six studies were conducted in high-income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age and measures of body mass/fat distribution were the most commonly used predictor variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies developing new scores performed better than validation studies, with 11 reporting an AUC of &gt;0.80 compared to one validation study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen validation studies reported sensitivities of &lt;80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The performance of scores did not differ by the number of variables included or the country setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a proliferation of newly developed risk scores using similar variables, which sometimes perform poorly upon external validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research should explore the recalibration, validation and applicability of existing scores to other settings, particularly in low/middle income countries, and on the utility of scores to improve <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related outcomes </plain></SENT>
