<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review reports the evidence for a relation between long-term coffee intake and risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous epidemiological studies have evaluated this association and, at this moment, at least fourteen out of eighteen cohort studies revealed a substantially lower risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with frequent coffee intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moderate coffee intake (&gt;/=4 cups of coffee/d of 150 mL or &gt;/=400 mg of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>/d) has generally been associated with a decrease in the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides, results of most studies suggest a dose-response relation, with greater reductions in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> risk with higher levels of coffee consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms underlying this protective effect, as well as the coffee components responsible for this association are suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite positive findings, it is still premature to recommend an increase in coffee consumption as a public health strategy to prevent type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More population-based surveys are necessary to clarify the long-term effects of decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee intake on the risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
