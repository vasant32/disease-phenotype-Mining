<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Psychological factors, namely <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and cognitive abilities, are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify independent association of particular cognitive functions with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cross sectional study 98 adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> attending <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Outpatient Clinic were examined using the measures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management (Summary of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) measure), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDI</z:chebi>)), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> distress (Problem Areas In <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> scale (PAID)), and the neuropsychological battery of tests for assessment of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify and evaluate the predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Specific cognitive functions, namely immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional abilities, attention, and specific executive functions (planning and problem solving) were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among cognitive factors, planning and problem solving abilities were strongest predictors; furthermore, in a multivariate regression their association was independent from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Specific cognitive abilities, particularly planning and problem solving, play an independent role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-management behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessing patients' cognitive abilities may be of value for adjusting self-management education and treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
