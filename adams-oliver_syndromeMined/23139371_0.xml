<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare magnetic resonance imaging-derived right ventricular (RV) dimensions and function between men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and healthy subjects, and to relate these parameters to left ventricular (LV) dimensions and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: RV and LV volumes and functions were assessed in 78 men with uncomplicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 28 healthy men within the same range of age using magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Steady-state free precession sequences were used to assess ventricular dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity mapping across the pulmonary valve and tricuspid valve was used to assess RV outflow and diastolic filling patterns, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate general linear models were used for statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RV end-diastolic volume was significantly decreased in patients compared with healthy subjects after adjustment for BMI and pulse pressure (177 ± 28 mL vs. 197 ± 47 mL, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RV systolic function was impaired: peak ejection rate across the pulmonary valve was decreased (433 ± 54 mL/s vs. 463 ± 71 mL/s, P &lt; 0.01) and pulmonary flow acceleration time was longer (124 ± 17 ms vs. 115 ± 25 ms, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indexes of RV diastolic function were impaired: peak filling rate and peak deceleration gradient of the early filling phase were 315 ± 63 mL/s vs. 356 ± 90 mL/s (P &lt; 0.01) and 2.3 ± 0.8 mL/s(2) × 10(-3) vs. 2.8 ± 0.8 mL/s(2) × 10(-3) (P &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> RV parameters were strongly associated with its corresponding LV parameter (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> affects the right ventricle, as demonstrated by RV remodeling and impaired systolic and diastolic functions in men with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in a similar manner as changes in LV dimensions and functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that RV impairment might be a component of the diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
