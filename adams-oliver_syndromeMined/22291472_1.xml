<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The risk for developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) is greater among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, patients with T2DM become more likely to be afflicted with diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreasing body weight has been shown to lower glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and improve other metabolic parameters in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medications used to lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> may increase body weight in patients with T2DM and this has been repeatedly shown to be the case for conventional, human insulin formulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin detemir is a neutral, soluble, long-acting insulin analog in which threonine-30 of the insulin B-chain is deleted, and the C-terminal lysine is acetylated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28875">myristic acid</z:chebi>, a C14 fatty acid chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin detemir binds to albumin, a property that enhances its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with insulin detemir is associated with less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> than either insulin glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are many potential reasons for the lower <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> observed among patients treated with insulin detemir, including lower risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and therefore decreased defensive eating due to concern about this adverse event, along with other effects that may be related to the albumin binding of this insulin that may account for lower within-patient variability and consistent action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These might include faster transport across the blood-brain barrier, induction of satiety signaling in the brain, and preferential inhibition of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production versus peripheral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experiments in diabetic rats have also indicated that insulin detemir increases adiponectin levels, which is associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and decreased eating </plain></SENT>
