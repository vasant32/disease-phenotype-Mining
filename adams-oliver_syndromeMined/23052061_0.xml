<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Disease Analyzer Database (UK) assembles longitudinal data on diagnoses, prescriptions and laboratory values reported from 674 office-based physicians (97 general practices) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (between 2005 and 2009) were identified and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was defined based on the International Classification of Diseases code (E11.3) or on the original diagnosis text </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time period between first <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis and first <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> diagnosis was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to examine associations of potential risk factors with prevalent diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 12,524 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in the general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 65 years with slightly more male patients (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was 19.0% (95% CI 18.3%, 19.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to first <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> diagnosis was 309 (interquartile range 50-693) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in multivariate logistic regression were age (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01, 1.03] per year of age), male sex (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01, 1.22]), HbA(1c) (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.02, 1.22] per 1% [11 mmol/mol] increase), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01, 1.05] per 10 units) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant relationships were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed in about one out of five patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the first year after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis in UK general practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age, male sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were identified as risk factors of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
