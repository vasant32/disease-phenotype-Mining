<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>, through activation of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK), prevented <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is involved in the link between <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies were conducted in mouse C2C12 myotubes and in the human myogenic cell line LHCN-M2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyse the involvement of AMPK, activators and inhibitors of this kinase and overexpression of a dominant negative AMPK construct (K45R) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">Palmitate</z:chebi> increased the levels of ER stress markers, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-exposed cells incubated with a lower concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>, the effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> were prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The induction of ER stress markers by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> was prevented by the presence of the AMPK activators AICAR and A-769662 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> to prevent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-induced ER stress and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (nuclear factor-kappa B [NF-ÎºB] DNA-binding activity and expression and secretion of IL6) as well as insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake was reversed in the presence of the AMPK inhibitor compound C or by overexpression of a dominant negative AMPK construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> reduced phospho-AMPK levels, whereas this was not observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>-exposed cells or in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-exposed cells supplemented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Overall, these findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> prevents ER stress, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-exposed skeletal muscle cells by activating AMPK </plain></SENT>
