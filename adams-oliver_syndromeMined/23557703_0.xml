<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of glycemia-associated genetic loci on islet function in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 43 SNPs in 4,654 normoglycemic participants from the Finnish population-based PPP-Botnia study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Islet function was assessed, in vivo, by measuring insulin and glucagon concentrations during OGTT, and, in vitro, by measuring <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion from human pancreatic islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carriers of risk variants in BCL11A, HHEX, ZBED3, HNF1A, IGF1 and NOTCH2 showed elevated, while those in CRY2, IGF2BP2, TSPAN8 and KCNJ11 decreased fasting and/or 2hr glucagon concentrations in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variants in BCL11A, TSPAN8, and NOTCH2 affected glucagon secretion both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MTNR1B variant was a clear outlier in the relationship analysis between insulin secretion and action, as well as between insulin, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of the genetic variants shown to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or glycemic traits also exert pleiotropic in vivo and in vitro effects on islet function </plain></SENT>
