<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children weighing 15 kilograms or less, and seen between January, 1997, and June, 2004, who had successful transcatheter closure of an interatrial communication within the oval fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transcatheter closure was performed in 35 patients weighing 15 kilograms or less, of whom 14 were male and 21 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedures were undertaken in 8 different centres, the patients having a median age of 3 years, with a range from zero to 6.2 years, and a mean weight of 13 kilograms, with a range from 3.6 to 15 kilograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were symptomatic, with associated cardiac malformations present in 4 cases, and extracardiac anomalies in 4 patients, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> in 3, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AOS">Adams Oliver syndrome</z:e> in the other case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, emergency cardiac surgery was needed 24 h after the procedure to correct a previously undiagnosed divided right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other complication occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 2 years, with a range from 0.5 to 5.2 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients are asymptomatic, except for one long-standing patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006533'>bronchodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 other patient, a small residual bidirectional shunt was detected by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient presented significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the patients followed-up for more than 12 months, we found a significant gain in <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcatheter closure of an interatrial communication within the oval fossa is efficient in children weighing 15 kilograms or less, and can be proposed as a first line of treatment in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>retarded growth</z:hpo> tend to have complete recovery within one year of closure </plain></SENT>
