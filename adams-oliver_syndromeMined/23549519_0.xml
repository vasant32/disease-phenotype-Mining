<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,381 patients aged ≥40 years and newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were followed up in national registries for 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was at 6 and 14 years after <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The original 6 year intervention included regular follow-up and individualised goal setting, supported by prompting of doctors, clinical guidelines, feedback and continuing medical education (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01074762) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The registry-based endpoints were: incidence of any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related endpoint; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>; and microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 14 year clinical follow-up, group differences in risk factors from the 6 year follow-up had levelled out, although the prevalence of (micro)<z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> and level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi> were lower in the intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 19 years of registry-based monitoring, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was not different between the intervention and comparison groups (58.9 vs 62.3 events per 1,000 patient-years, respectively; for structured personal care, HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83, 1.08, p = 0.40), but a lower risk emerged for fatal and non-fatal MI (27.3 vs 33.5, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68, 0.98, p = 0.030) and any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related endpoint (69.5 vs 82.1, HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97, p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences persisted after extensive multivariable adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In concert with features such as prompting, feedback, clinical guidelines and continuing medical education, individualisation of goal setting and drug treatment may safely be applied to treat patients newly diagnosed with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to lower the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
