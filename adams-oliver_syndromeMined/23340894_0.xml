<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of varying the daily injection time of insulin degludec (IDeg), an ultra-long-acting basal insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 26-week, open-label, treat-to-target trial enrolled adults (≥18 years) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were either insulin naïve and receiving oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs (OADs) (HbA1c = 7-11%) or previously on basal insulin ± OAD(s) (HbA1c = 7-10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomized to 1) once-daily (OD) IDeg in a prespecified dosing schedule, creating 8-40-h intervals between injections (IDeg OD Flex; n = 229); 2) once-daily IDeg at the main evening meal (IDeg OD; n = 228); or 3) once-daily insulin glargine at the same time each day (IGlar OD; n = 230) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was noninferiority of IDeg OD Flex to IGlar OD in HbA1c reduction after 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS After 26 weeks, IDeg OD Flex, IDeg OD, and IGlar OD improved HbA1c by 1.28, 1.07, and 1.26% points, respectively (estimated treatment difference [IDeg OD Flex - IGlar OD]: 0.04% points [-0.12 to 0.20], confirming noninferiority) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences in overall or nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were found between IDeg OD Flex and IGlar OD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparable glycemic control and rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> were seen with IDeg OD Flex and IDeg OD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse event profiles were similar across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The use of extreme dosing intervals of 8-40 h demonstrates that the daily injection time of IDeg can be varied without compromising glycemic control or safety </plain></SENT>
