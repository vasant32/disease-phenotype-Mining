<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a public health problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is managed in its initial phase, the morbidity and mortality due to this combination may be prevented at an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to determine the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among adults aged between 25 to 60 years in Karachi, Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2006 to September 2007, a matched case control study (n = 592) was conducted in Civil Hospital, Karachi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 296) diagnosed within one month were recruited from diabetic Out Patient Department (OPD) of Civil Hospital, Karachi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were matched on age and sex with controls (n = 296), who were attendants sitting in the medical out patient department of the same hospital, recruited on the basis of absence of classical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000103'>polyuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001959'>polydipsia</z:hpo> along with random blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of &lt;200 mg/dl measured by a glucometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was identified by the Siddiqui Shah <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was applied to examine the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and other independent variables with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at 95% C.I. and P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study comprised of 592 subjects with 432(73%) males and 160(27%) females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> was significantly associated with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> having mild level (mOR: 3.86; 95%CI: 2.22,6.71) and moderate to severe level (mOR: 3.41; 95%CI: 2.07,5.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>History of (h/o) <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> (mOR: 2.83; 95%CI: 1.05,7.64), family h/o <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mOR: 1.59; 95%CI: 1.04,2.43), nuclear family (mOR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.14,2.69), BMI (mOR: 1.62; 95%CI: 1.01,2.60 for <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and mOR: 2.12; 95%CI: 1.19,3.79 for overweight vs healthy to underweight) were also significantly associated with outcome, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, h/o smoking and h/o high BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diabetics should be screened simultaneously for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and concomitant preventive strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo>, nuclear family and high BMI should also be used to prevent mortality/morbidity among patients between 25 to 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
