<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, clinical trial in T2DM patients inadequately controlled by stable insulin therapy, with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg bid or placebo for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 449 patients were randomized to vildagliptin (n = 228) or placebo (n = 221) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 weeks, the difference in adjusted mean change in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) between vildagliptin and placebo was -0.7 ± 0.1% (p &lt; 0.001) in the overall study population, -0.6 ± 0.1% (p &lt; 0.001) in the subgroup also receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and -0.8 ± 0.2% (p &lt; 0.001) in the subgroup without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin therapy was well tolerated and had a similarly low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> compared with placebo (8.4 vs. 7.2%, p = 0.66) in spite of improved glycaemic control, and was not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin 50 mg bid added to insulin significantly reduced HbA1c in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by insulin, with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vildagliptin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results were achieved without <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> or an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> incidence or severity in spite of improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
