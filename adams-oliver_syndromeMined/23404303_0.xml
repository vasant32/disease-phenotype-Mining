<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ankle brachial index (ABI) is used for the diagnosis of PAD and represents a predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), even if in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> its diagnostic and predictive value seems to be reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No study has evaluated TcPO2 as a predictor of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim of this longitudinal study was to assess whether TcPO2 is better than ABI at predicting MACE in type 2 diabetic patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAmong 361 consecutive patients with apparently uncomplicated <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 67 MACE occurred during a follow-up period of 45.8 ± 23.2 months.RESULTSThe percentage of both subjects with low ABI (≤0.9) and subjects with low TcPO2 (≤46 mmHg as measured by a receiver operating characteristic curve) was significantly (&lt;0.001) greater among patients with than among those without MACEs (ABI 64.2 vs. 40.8; TcPO2 58.2 vs. 34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method showed that both low ABI (Mantel log-rank test, 4.087; P = 0.043) and low TcPO2 (Mantel log-rank test, 33.748; P &gt; 0.0001) were associated with a higher rate of MACEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed that low TcPO2 (hazard ratio 1.78 [95% CI 1.44-2.23]; P &lt; 0.001) was a significant predictor of MACE, while ABI did not enter the model.CONCLUSIONSThis longitudinal study showed that TcPO2 may be a potential predictor of MACE among patients with uncomplicated type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that its predictive value seems to be greater than that of ABI </plain></SENT>
