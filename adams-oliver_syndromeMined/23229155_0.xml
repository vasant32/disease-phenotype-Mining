<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to elucidate which L-type channel isoform is functionally important and its association with inherited <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Beta cells of human islets from cadaver donors were enriched using FACS to study the expression of the genes encoding voltage-gated calcium channel (Ca(v))1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 by absolute quantitative PCR in whole human and rat islets, as well as in clonal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-cell exocytosis was monitored as increases in cell capacitance after treatment with small interfering (si)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> against CACNA1D (which encodes Ca(v)1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 8,987 non-diabetic and 2,830 type 2 diabetic individuals from Finland and Sweden and analysed for associations with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and insulin phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In FACS-enriched human beta cells, CACNA1D <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression exceeded that of CACNA1C (which encodes Ca(v)1.2) by approximately 60-fold and was decreased in islets from type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter coincided with diminished secretion of insulin in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CACNA1D siRNA reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release in INS-1 832/13 cells and exocytosis in human beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phenotype/genotype associations of three SNPs in the CACNA1D gene revealed an association between the C allele of the SNP rs312480 and reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> in vivo, whereas both rs312486/G and rs9841978/G were associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the L-type calcium channel Ca(v)1.3 is important in human <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion, and common variants in CACNA1D might contribute to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
