<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is an ancillary analysis that examined changes in QOL after exercise training using the Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire compared across treatment groups and with U.S. national norms.RESULTSThe ancillary sample (n = 173) had high baseline QOL compared with U.S. national norms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The QOL physical component subscale (PCS) and the general health (GH) subscale were improved by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three exercise training conditions compared with the control group condition (resistance: PCS, P = 0.005; GH, P = 0.003; aerobic: PCS, P = 0.001; GH, P = 0.024; combined: PCS, P = 0.015; GH, P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resistance training group had the most beneficial changes in bodily pain (P = 0.026), whereas physical functioning was most improved in the aerobic and combined condition groups (P = 0.025 and P = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in the mental component score did not differ between the control group and any of the exercise groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined training condition group had greater gains than the aerobic training condition group in the mental component score (P = 0.004), vitality (P = 0.031), and mental health (P = 0.008), and greater gains in vitality compared with the control group (P = 0.021).CONCLUSIONSExercise improves QOL in individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined aerobic/resistance exercise produces greater benefit in some QOL domains </plain></SENT>
