<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fixed-dose combination (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) therapies offer a means to simplify complex treatment regimens, and have several advantages that help patients reach their glycaemic goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, four key benefits are identified and discussed in support of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> for treatment of patients with T2DM: (i) Greater efficacy compared with higher dose monotherapy, (ii) Reduced risk of adverse reactions relative to higher dose monotherapy, (iii) Lower overall costs and (iv) Improved medication concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given these advantages, the place of fixed combination therapy in the course of treatment is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Establishing a therapeutic strategy that incorporates fixed combination therapy (including combinations with insulin) will simplify the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ideally resulting in improved medication concordance, clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
