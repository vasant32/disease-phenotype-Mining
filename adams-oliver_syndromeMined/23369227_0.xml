<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this cross-sectional study, we investigated whether serum irisin levels are decreased in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) compared with control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT), and assessed the association between serum irisin levels and various metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population was selected from a population-based study and included 104 subjects with NGT and 104 subjects with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum irisin and adiponectin levels and metabolic parameters were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between irisin levels and newly diagnosed T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum irisin levels were significantly decreased in the new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> T2D group compared with the NGT control group (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable model adjusted for various metabolic parameters, increased irisin levels were associated with reduced odds (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.88, p=0.006) of prevalent newly diagnosed T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that 2h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was an independent variable influencing serum irisin levels (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the present study, we found that serum irisin levels were decreased in T2D patients and inversely associated with newly diagnosed T2D, suggesting that irisin may play a crucial role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and T2D </plain></SENT>
