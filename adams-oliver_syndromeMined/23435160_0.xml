<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of a structured self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) protocol and the resulting improvements in glycemic control on changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe Structured Testing Program (STeP) study was a prospective, cluster-randomized, multicenter trial in which 483 poorly controlled, insulin-naïve patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were randomized to active control (ACG) or structured testing (STG) that included quarterly structured SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in A1C, hs-CRP, and glycemic variability (STG subjects only) were measured at baseline and quarterly.RESULTSReductions in geometric mean hs-CRP values were significantly greater in the STG group at months 3 (P = 0.005), 6 (P = 0.0003), and 12 (P = 0.04) than in the ACG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STG patients at high CV risk (&gt;3 mg/L) showed significantly greater reductions in hs-CRP levels than ACG patients at high CV risk: -3.64 mg/dL (95% CI -4.21 to -3.06) versus -2.18 mg/dL (-2.93 to -1.43), respectively (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between reductions in hs-CRP and A1C in both groups: standardized coefficient (β) was 0.25 for the entire cohort (P &lt; 0.0001), 0.31 for STG (P &lt; 0.0001), and 0.16 for ACG (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONSReductions in hs-CRP level are associated with reductions in A1C but not reductions in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> or glycemic variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive structured SMBG-based interventions that lower A1C may translate into improvements in CV risk, as evidenced by levels of the biomarker hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
