<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE A 12-week study assessed the efficacy and safety of a new oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent, imeglimin, as add-on therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 156 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive imeglimin (1,500 mg twice a day) or placebo added to a stable dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (1,500-2,000 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Change in A1C from baseline was the primary efficacy outcome; secondary outcomes included fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) and proinsulin/insulin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS After 12 weeks, the placebo-subtracted decrease in A1C with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-imeglimin was -0.44% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>-imeglimin also significantly improved FPG and the proinsulin/insulin ratio from baseline (-0.91 mg/dL and -7.5, respectively) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-placebo (0.36 mg/dL and 11.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi>-imeglimin therapy was generally well-tolerated with a comparable safety profile to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>-placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Addition of imeglimin to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> improved glycemic control and offers potential as a new treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
