<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROactive ("PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events") has provided valuable, although controversial, information on the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> on cardiovascular outcomes in a high-risk population of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and established macrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since 2005, there has been much debate on the relative value of the statistically non-significant 10% reduction in the quite challenging primary composite endpoint (combining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>-driven and procedural events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular beds) versus the statistically significant 16% decrease in the more robust and conventional main secondary endpoint (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Revisiting PROactive deserves much interest following the report of inconclusive results on cardiovascular efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in RECORD, the withdrawal (limitation) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> because of cardiovascular safety concern, the recent publication of a statement positioning <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the near availability of cheaper generics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although subanalyses may have more limited value from a statistical viewpoint, they nonetheless can provide valuable information on the drug efficacy/safety profile and clinical insights into which patients might benefit most (in terms of cardiovascular outcomes) from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
