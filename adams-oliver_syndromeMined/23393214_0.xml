<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear which patients benefit most from GMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This secondary analysis examined the impact of baseline insulin regimen on GMC response.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe analyzed a trial of 239 veterans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> randomized to GMC or usual care (UC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We categorized baseline insulin regimen as the following: no insulin; basal insulin only; or complex insulin (basal-prandial or mixed regimens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using linear mixed models adjusted for clustering within GMC, we evaluated the differential impact of GMC relative to UC on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and self-efficacy among patients on different baseline insulin regimens.RESULTSFrom linear mixed models, the effect of GMC on HbA(1c) differed by baseline insulin regimen versus UC (P = 0.05); there was no differential effect on self-efficacy (P = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those using complex insulin regimens at baseline, GMC reduced HbA(1c) by study end compared with UC (-1.0%; 95% CI -1.8 to -0.2; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no such HbA(1c) difference between GMC and UC patients using no insulin (P = 0.65) or basal insulin only (P = 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no clinically significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> by baseline insulin regimen and intervention group.CONCLUSIONSWe found that compared with UC, GMC lowered HbA(1c) specifically among patients using complex insulin regimens at study baseline, which may relate to this group's demanding medication and self-management requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implementing GMC among patients using complex insulin regimens may maximize this care delivery strategy's potential </plain></SENT>
