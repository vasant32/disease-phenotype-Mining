<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plasma adiponectin is a significant correlate of the pro-inflammatory cardiometabolic risk profile associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Salivary pH is influenced by several cardiometabolic risk components such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, oxidation and numerous oral and systemic health modulators, including the menopausal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the association between plasma adiponectin concentrations and salivary pH in women according to the menopausal status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Unstimulated saliva collection was performed in 151 Caucasian women of French-Canadian origin (53 premenopausal women (PMW) and 98 menopausal women (MW)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Student's t test, ANOVA and linear regression models were used to assess the association between plasma adiponectin concentrations and salivary pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma adiponectin levels increased as a function of salivary pH in the whole sample and among MW (r = 0.29 and r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the variance of plasma adiponectin levels explained by the salivary pH (R2) was 10.8% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin levels progressively increased across salivary pH quartiles (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that salivary pH is a significant correlate of plasma adiponectin levels in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the increasing prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, new technologies should be developed to more easily monitor health status, disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Salivary pH, a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive measure, could be a very promising avenue </plain></SENT>
