<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highlights from abstracts presented at the 2010 meetings of the European Association for the Study of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association include studies and analyses that shed light on the promising role for saxagliptin within the management of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data show that saxagliptin combination therapy improves HbA1c levels compared with placebo, particularly in patients with high HbA1c at baseline, long duration of disease, low baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, and low homeostasis model assessment 2 β-cell function at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These efficacy benefits are achieved without any increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> or other adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study results also show that the saxagliptin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination is a good candidate for initial therapy in drug-naïve patients treated for as long as 72 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survey data presented confirm that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (and fear of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>) is a barrier to patients' acceptance of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment, limiting its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, therapies such as saxagliptin that have a low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> may be more acceptable to patients in helping them to achieve glycemic control and to optimize their quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, for whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is contraindicated, saxagliptin monotherapy is a promising option for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> management as, when given at a reduced dose, it is well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to that of placebo </plain></SENT>
