<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There has been growing evidence that inflammatory markers play a role in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to systematically review prospective studies on the associations of elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by conducting a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library databases up until 10 February 2012 was conducted to retrieve prospective studies matched to search terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used generalized least-squares trend estimation to assess dose-response relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The summary risk estimates were pooled using either fixed-effects or random-effects models to incorporate between-study variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The meta-analysis, including 10 prospective studies, with a total of 19,709 participants and 4,480 cases, detected a significant dose-response association of IL-6 levels with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (relative risk [RR] 1.31 [95% CI 1.17-1.46]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For CRP, the meta-analysis involving 22 cohorts, with a total of 40,735 participants and 5,753 cases, showed that elevated CRP levels were significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1.26 [1.16-1.37]), with the absence of publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and subgroup analyses further supported the associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides further evidence that elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP are significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
