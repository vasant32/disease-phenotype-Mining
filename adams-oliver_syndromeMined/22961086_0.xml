<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">semistarvation</z:e>-refeeding that exhibits catch-up fat, we previously reported that during refeeding on a low-fat diet, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but insulin-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization is decreased in skeletal muscle and increased in adipose tissue, where de novo lipogenic capacity is concomitantly enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that isocaloric refeeding on a high-fat (HF) diet blunts the enhanced in vivo insulin-dependent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization for de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These are shown to be early events of catch-up growth that are independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> and precede the development of overt <z:mp ids='MP_0006094'>adipocyte hypertrophy</z:mp>, adipose tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, or defective insulin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a role for enhanced DNL as a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sink in regulating glycemia during catch-up growth, which is blunted by exposure to an HF diet, thereby contributing, together with skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings are presented as an extension of the Randle cycle hypothesis, whereby the suppression of DNL constitutes a mechanism by which dietary <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> antagonize <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization for storage as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in adipose tissue, thereby impairing <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis during catch-up growth </plain></SENT>
