<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are an increasing number of patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> caused by type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We intended to study the preventive and therapeutic effect of L-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> (LC) on nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic mice and to explore its possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty male Kungming mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, diabetic group, pre-treatment group (125 mg/kg BW), low-dose (125 mg/kg BW) therapeutic group and high-dose (250 mg/kg BW) therapeutic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of hepatocytes was observed by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LC and ALC (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> L-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>) concentrations in the liver were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, liver weight, insulin levels and free fatty acid (FFA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) levels in the liver and plasma were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average liver LC and ALC levels were 33.7% and 20% lower, respectively, in diabetic mice compared to control mice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After preventive and therapeutic treatment with LC, less hepatocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo>, clearer crista and fewer <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> granules in the mitochondria were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003402'>Decreased liver weight</z:mp>, TG levels, and FFA concentrations (P &lt; 0.05) in the liver were also observed after treatment with LC in diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, liver LC and ALC levels increased upon treatment with LC, whereas the ratio of LC and ALC decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LC supplements ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic mice by increasing fatty acid oxidation and decreasing the LC/ALC ratio in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, oral administration of LC protected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in liver </plain></SENT>
