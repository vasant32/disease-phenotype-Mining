<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between serum ucOC levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in humans with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We measured serum ucOC levels in 129 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> indices used were the M value, which is the total body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate, and the M/I value, which is the M value adjusted for the steady state plasma insulin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ucOC levels were not correlated with the M value (ρ = -0.013, p = 0.886) or the M/I value (ρ = 0.001, p = 0.995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between ucOC levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
