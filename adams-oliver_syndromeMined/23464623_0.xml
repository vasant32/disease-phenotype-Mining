<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine preferences for oral medication attributes among participants with early and advanced Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) in the United Kingdom (UK) using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A web-based DCE was administered where participants indicated which medication they preferred from two different hypothetical oral anti-diabetic (OAD) medication profiles, each composed of differing levels of seven attributes (efficacy, hypoglycaemic events, weight change, gastrointestinal/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> side effects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infection</z:e>, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk) for 20 sets of pair-wise comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A random effects multinomial logit regression model was used to estimate the preference weight for each of the attribute levels, and the relative importance of each attribute was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were conducted for the overall sample and for medication and gender subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final sample included 100 participants with a mean age of 62.9 (SD 11.1) years and comparable numbers of participants of each gender (51% male, 49% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the participants were White-British (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total preference weight (PW) and corresponding relative importance (RI) were highest for four of the seven attributes: hypoglycaemic events (PW=1.98; RI=24.7%), weight change (PW=1.65; RI=20.6%), gastrointestinal/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> side effects (PW=1.49; RI=18.6%), and efficacy (PW=1.44; RI=18.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative importance values differed for some attributes across gender and number of current T2DM medication subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, weight change, gastrointestinal side effects and efficacy are of primary importance to patients in their OAD preferences in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These four attributes comprised over 80% of the relative importance </plain></SENT>
