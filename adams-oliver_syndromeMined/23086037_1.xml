<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated patterns of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from drug-naïve patients with newly diagnosed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic subjects had significantly increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of NLRP3, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and proinflammatory cytokines in MDMs cultured with autologous sera compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upregulated interleukin (IL)-1β maturation, IL-18 secretion, and caspase-1 cleavage were observed in MDMs from type 2 diabetic patients after stimulation with various danger molecules (ATP, high-mobility group protein B1, free fatty acids, islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, and monosodium <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> crystals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species and NLRP3 were required for IL-1β synthesis in MDMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, 2 months of therapy with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> significantly inhibited the maturation of IL-1β in MDMs from patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is elevated in myeloid cells from type 2 diabetic patients and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> contributes to modulation of inflammasome activation in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
