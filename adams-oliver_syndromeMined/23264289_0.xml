<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given the importance of glycemic control in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of tools now available to monitor the day-to-day trends in glycemia is remarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this regard, self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) has been considered a key component of patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arguably, there remains almost universal agreement that SMBG should be available to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients regardless of current treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, recently there have been reports that have challenged the current paradigm that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients should use SMBG and concluded that SMBG for type 2 diabetic patients not on insulin may not be beneficial on glycemic control and must be weighed against the expense and inconvenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this two-part point-counterpoint narrative, Malanda et al. and Polonsky and Fisher take opposing views on the utility of SMBG to be valuable for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> not using insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the narrative below, Malanda et al. suggest that the evidence for potentially beneficial SMBG-induced effects on glycemic control, hypoglycemic periods, and potential harms in type 2 diabetic patients who are not treated with insulin does not justify the use of SMBG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the use of SMBG is associated with huge costs, which should be better redirected to effective strategies to improve health for this category of patients </plain></SENT>
