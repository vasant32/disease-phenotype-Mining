<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the age-adjusted incidences of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 1,058 ruptured and 484 unruptured sIA patients during 1994-2008, using the national registry of prescribed medicine purchases.RESULTSOf the 1,058 ruptured sIA patients, 43% were males and 57% females, with a median age at rupture of 51 and 56 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1994 to 2008 or until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 9% had been prescribed antidiabetes medication (ADM) with a median starting age of 58 years for males and 66 years for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 484 unruptured sIA patients, 44% were males and 56% females, with a median age at the diagnosis of 53 and 55 years, respectively, and 9% had used ADM, with a median starting age of 61 years for males and 66 years for females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was highest in the age-group 60-70 years, with no significant differences between the ruptured and unruptured sIA patients.CONCLUSIONSOur study suggests that type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> does not increase the risk of rupture of sIA, which is by far the most frequent cause of nontraumatic SAH </plain></SENT>
