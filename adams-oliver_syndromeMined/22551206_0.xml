<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) has been increasing in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sleep loss and circadian rhythm abnormalities are thought to be one of the underlying causes of adverse metabolic health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about sleep-wake cycle irregularities in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study compared the bedtime, waking time, and estimated sleep duration between T2DM and non-T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects were 106 consecutive outpatients with lifestyle-related diseases (males/females = 56/50), who answered a questionnaire on sleep status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into two groups; non-T2DM (n = 32) and T2DM (n = 74) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T2DM subjects retired to bed on weekdays and holidays significantly later than non-T2DM subjects (23:43 versus 22:52, p = 0.0032; 23:45 versus 22:53, p = 0.0038, respectively), and woke up significantly later on weekdays and holidays, compared with non-T2DM subjects (06:39 versus 06:08, p = 0.0325; 06:58 versus 06:24, p = 0.0450, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the estimated sleep duration between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daytime sleepiness was reported significantly more commonly by T2DM subjects than non-T2DM subjects (p = 0.0195) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-wake cycle irregularities are more common in T2DM subjects than non-T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Confirmation that such irregularity plays a role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> of T2DM requires further investigation in the future </plain></SENT>
