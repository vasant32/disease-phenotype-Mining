<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We investigated the relationship between weight change and related factors in subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) treated with liraglutide versus comparator <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six-week data from seven phase 3, randomized trials in the liraglutide T2DM development programme were analysed by trial and treatment group: liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg), active comparator and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included proportions of subjects in various weight change categories and their percentage weight change from baseline; impact of body mass index (BMI) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) on weight change and correlation of weight change with change in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A number of subjects experienced &gt;5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> during the trials (24.4% liraglutide 1.8 mg and 17.7% liraglutide 1.2 mg; 17.7% exenatide, 10.0% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, 3.6-7.0% sulphonylurea, 2.6% thiazolidinedione and 2.6% glargine; 9.9% placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was seen with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg than with active comparators except exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Across trials, higher initial BMI was associated with slightly greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> with liraglutide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> increased slightly the longer GI AEs persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although HbA1c reduction was slightly larger in higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> categories across treatments (including placebo), sample sizes were small and no clear correlation could be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide-treated subjects experienced additional HbA1c reduction beyond that which appeared weight induced; thus, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HbA1c-lowering effect appears weight mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of liraglutide-treated T2DM subjects experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> was greater and occurred more in glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-treated subjects than in active comparator-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
