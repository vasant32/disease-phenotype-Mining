<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The study was aimed at investigating the correlations of serum AE activity with cholinesterase (ChE) and metabolic variables in healthy subjects in comparison to subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>-free T2DM subjects and healthy controls, the AE activity levels and/or the correlation patterns between AE and the other variables were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither AE nor ChE activities were higher in the subjects with T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum AE activity strongly correlated with ChE as well as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> variables such as total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> in healthy subjects, while the correlations between AE and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> variables were not present in T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data may reflect the pathophysiological changes between healthy and T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data may thus provide the basis for future studies to unravel the mechanisms </plain></SENT>
