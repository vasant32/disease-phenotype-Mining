<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied nine families affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e>, eight of which have not been clinically described before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our patients, scalp abnormalities were most often found, followed by limb and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> appeared to be <z:mp ids='MP_0002544'>brachydactyly</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001770'>syndactyly of toes</z:hpo> 2 and 3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001800'>hypoplastic toenails</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional features observed were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>cutis marmorata</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">telangiectatica congenita</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify the disease-causing mutations in our families, we selected two genes, ALX4 and MSX2, which were considered serious candidates based on their known function in skull and limb development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis of both genes, performed by direct sequencing, identified several polymorphisms, but no disease-causing mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we can conclude that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> in our set of patients is not caused by mutations in ALX4 or MSX2 </plain></SENT>
