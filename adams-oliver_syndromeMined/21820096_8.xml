<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is usually inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> trait, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive inheritance</z:hpo> has also been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an individual with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e>, we combined autozygome analysis with exome sequencing to identify a homozygous truncating mutation in dedicator of cytokinesis 6 gene (DOCK6) which encodes an atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi> exchange factor (GEF) known to activate two members of the Rho GTPase family: Cdc42 and Rac1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another homozygous truncating mutation was identified upon targeted sequencing of DOCK6 in an unrelated individual with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the established role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, we demonstrate a <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> typical of a defective actin cytoskeleton in patient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings, combined with a Dock6 expression profile that is consistent with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> phenotype as well as the very recent demonstration of dominant mutations of ARHGAP31 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e>, establish Cdc42 and Rac1 as key molecules in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> and suggest that other regulators of these Rho GTPase proteins might be good candidates in the quest to define the genetic spectrum of this genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition </plain></SENT>
