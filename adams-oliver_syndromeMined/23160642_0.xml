<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review with meta-regression analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the association between intensity and volume of exercise training (aerobic, resistance or combined) and HbA(1c) changes in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched (1980-2012) to retrieve RCTs of at least 12 weeks' duration, consisting of supervised exercise training vs no intervention, that reported HbA(1c) changes and exercise characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two independent reviewers conducted study selection and data extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six RCTs (2,253 patients) met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, baseline HbA(1c) and exercise frequency explained nearly 58% of between-study variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline HbA(1c) was inversely correlated with HbA(1c) reductions after the three types of exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In aerobic training, exercise volume (represented by frequency of sessions) was associated with changes in HbA(1c) (weighted r = -0.64), while no variables were correlated with glycaemic control induced by resistance training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In combined training, weekly volume of resistance exercise explained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in multivariate analysis and was associated with changes in HbA(1c) levels (weighted r = -0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Reduction in HbA(1c) is associated with exercise frequency in supervised aerobic training, and with weekly volume of resistance exercise in supervised combined training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, exercise volume is a major determinant of glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
