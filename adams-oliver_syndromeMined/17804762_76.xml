<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies have identified common, novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility loci within the FTO, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, HHEX/IDE, and SLC30A8 gene regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to explore the relationships between the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alleles and measures of beta-cell function and whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,276 healthy subjects of European ancestry were studied at 19 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indexes of beta-cell function (including 30-min insulin response and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity) were derived from a 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I) was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotype/phenotype relationships were studied by linear trend analysis correcting for age, sex, and recruitment center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alleles were both associated with decreased 30-min insulin response (both P = 0.0002) and decreased pancreatic beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity (P = 9.86 x 10(-5) and 0.009, respectively), and these relationships remained after correction for M/I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FTO susceptibility allele showed a weak but consistent association with <z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>increased adiposity</z:mp>, which in turn was linked to a decrease in M/I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, none of the other novel <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility alleles were associated with insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated alleles are associated with decreased pancreatic beta-cell function, including decreased beta-cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity that relates insulin secretion to plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the association between the FTO allele and <z:mp ids='MP_0010024'>increased adiposity</z:mp>, but none of the other novel susceptibility alleles were associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
