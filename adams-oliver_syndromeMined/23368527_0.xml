<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are at greater risk of fractures mostly due to not only to extraskeletal factors, such as propensity to fall, but also to bone quality alteration, which reduces bone strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin deficiency and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> seem to play a role in determining bone formation alteration by advanced glycation end product (AGE) accumulation or AGE/RAGE (receptors for AGE) axis imbalance, which directly influence osteoblast activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are able to negatively influence osteocalcin production and the Wnt signalling pathways with an imbalance of osteoblast/osteoclast activity leading to bone quality reduction as global effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, other factors such as insulin growth factors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ pathways seem to have an important role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although there are conflicting data in literature, adequate glycaemic control with hypoglycaemic treatment may be an important element in preventing bone tissue alterations in both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attention should be paid to the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>, especially in older women, because the direct negative effect on bone could exceed the positive effect of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, preliminary data on animals and in humans suggest the hypothesis that incretins and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors could have a positive effect on bone metabolism by a direct effect on bone cells; however, such issue needs further investigations </plain></SENT>
