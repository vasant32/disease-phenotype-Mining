<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, appropriate measures of eating behaviours, such as eating rate, have not yet been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the associations among eating rate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 7,275 Japanese individuals aged â‰¥40 years who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were divided into four groups according to self-reported eating rate: slow, medium, relatively fast and very fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations between eating rate and various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were investigated cross-sectionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportions of participants who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> or who had elevated waist circumference levels increased progressively with increases in eating rate (p for trend &lt;0.001), regardless of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders, namely, age, sex, total energy intake, dietary fibre intake, current smoking, current drinking and regular exercise (p for trend &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels also tended to increase in association with eating rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) rose significantly as eating rate increased, even after multivariate adjustment, including BMI, in diabetic patients on insulin therapy (p = 0.02), whereas fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> did not increase significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that eating rate is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and therefore may be a modifiable risk factor in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
