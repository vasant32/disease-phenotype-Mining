<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated the association between serum metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics and risk of T2D in the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam (27,548 adults) among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> incident cases of T2D (n = 800, mean follow-up 7 years) and a randomly drawn subcohort (n = 2,282) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 163 metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, in baseline serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18133">hexose</z:chebi>; phenylalanine; and diacyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholines</z:chebi> C32:1, C36:1, C38:3, and C40:5 were independently associated with increased risk of T2D and serum glycine; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> C16:1; acyl-alkyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholines</z:chebi> C34:3, C40:6, C42:5, C44:4, and C44:5; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="11230">lysophosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> C18:2 with decreased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variance of the metabolites was largely explained by two metabolite factors with opposing risk associations (factor 1 relative risk in extreme quintiles 0.31 [95% CI 0.21-0.44], factor 2 3.82 [2.64-5.52]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The metabolites significantly improved T2D prediction compared with established risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were further linked to insulin sensitivity and secretion in the TÃ¼bingen Family study and were partly replicated in the independent KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that metabolic alterations, including sugar metabolites, amino acids, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, are associated early on with a higher risk of T2D </plain></SENT>
