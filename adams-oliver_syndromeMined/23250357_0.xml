<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We designed an experiment to examine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> sequestration with Colesevelam on fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To do so, we tested the hypothesis that Colesevelam increases the disposition index (DI), and this increase is associated with increased glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight subjects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy were studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were studied before and after 12 weeks of Colesevelam or placebo using a labeled triple-tracer mixed meal to measure the rate of meal appearance (Meal Ra), endogenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production (EGP), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disappearance (Rd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and β-cell responsivity indices were estimated using the oral minimal model and then used to calculate DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy with Colesevelam was associated with a decrease in fasting (7.0 ± 0.2 vs. 6.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L; P = 0.004) and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations (3,145 ± 138 vs. 2,896 ± 127 mmol/6 h; P = 0.01) in the absence of a change in insulin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minimal model-derived indices of insulin secretion and action were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postprandial GLP-1 concentrations were not altered by Colesevelam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although EGP and Rd were unchanged, integrated Meal Ra was decreased by Colesevelam (5,191 ± 204 vs. 5,817 ± 204 μmol/kg/6 h; P = 0.04), suggesting increased splanchnic sequestration of meal-derived <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
