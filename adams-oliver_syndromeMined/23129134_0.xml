<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether amino acids predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index in healthy young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Circulating isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and six additional amino acids were quantified in 1,680 individuals from the population-based Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (baseline age 32 Â± 5 years; 54% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) at baseline and 6-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amino acid associations with HOMA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were assessed using regression models adjusted for established risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further examined whether amino acid profiling could augment risk assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (defined as 6-year HOMA-IR &gt;90th percentile) in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine were associated with HOMA-IR at baseline and for men at 6-year follow-up, while for women only leucine, valine, and phenylalanine predicted 6-year HOMA-IR (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the other amino acids were prospectively associated with HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sum of branched-chain and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33856">aromatic amino acid</z:chebi> concentrations was associated with 6-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> for men (odds ratio 2.09 [95% CI 1.38-3.17]; P = 0.0005); however, including the amino acid score in prediction models did not improve risk discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Branched-chain and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33856">aromatic amino acids</z:chebi> are markers of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in young, normoglycemic adults, with most pronounced associations for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the association of branched-chain and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33856">aromatic amino acids</z:chebi> with the risk for future <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is at least partly mediated through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
