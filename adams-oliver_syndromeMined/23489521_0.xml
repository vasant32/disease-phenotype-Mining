<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is assess efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin lispro and insulin aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a lack of data indicating improved fetal outcomes would suggest that there is no imperative to switch to a short acting analogue where the woman is well controlled with human insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are no reports of the use of insulin glulisine in pregnancy and so it cannot be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most studies of insulin glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue insulin glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A head-to-head comparison between insulin detemir and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin in women with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed that while fetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> improved with insulin detemir without an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The greater evidence base supports the use of insulin detemir as the first line long acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive fetal benefits means that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There seems little justification in using insulin analogues in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> or women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> where the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> is low </plain></SENT>
