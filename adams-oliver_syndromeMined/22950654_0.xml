<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This first-time-in-human single ascending dose study explored the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the selective DGAT1 inhibitor AZD7687 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty healthy male subjects were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each of 10 cohorts, six subjects received the same dose of AZD7687 orally (range across cohorts 1-60 mg) and two placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma AZD7687 exposure was measured repeatedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprandial serum TAG excursion was measured during 8 h after a standardized mixed meal with fat energy content of 60% (SMM 60%; five cohorts, 1-20 mg), before (baseline) and after dosing, to assess effects on gut DGAT1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AZD7687 markedly reduced postprandial TAG excursion with a steep concentration-effect relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incremental TAG AUC (area under the serum concentration vs. time curve) following SMM 60% was decreased &gt;75% from baseline at doses â‰¥5 mg (p &lt; 0.0001 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of diacylglycerol, specifically measured with mass spectrometry, did not increase after AZD7687 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and diarrhoea were reported with increasing doses and they limited dose escalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lowering of SMM fat content to 45 or 30% in five cohorts gradually reduced the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms at a given dose of AZD7687 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The attenuating effect of AZD7687 on postprandial TAG excursion provides proof of mechanism with respect to gut DGAT1 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, dose and diet-related gastrointestinal side effects may impact further development of DGAT1 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
