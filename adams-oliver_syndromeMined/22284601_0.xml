<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined stress-response patterns in plasma leptin, ghrelin, hsCRP, IL-6, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and insulin levels before and up to 5 days after cardiopulmonary bypass in 20 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 20 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma leptin levels increased significantly in both groups (p&lt;0.05) and rose significantly higher in diabetics when compared with nondiabetic patients (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma ghrelin levels increased significantly only in diabetics (p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed significantly elevated serum concentrations of IL-6, hsCRP, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and insulin (p&lt;0.005 for IL-6, hsCRP; p&lt;0.05 for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, insulin) but the difference between the two groups was nonsignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leptin was independently predicted by hsCRP (p&lt;0.05, F=2.9), gender (women p&lt;0.001, F=4.7), body mass index (BMI p&lt;0.0001, F=6.1) whereas ghrelin levels were not associated with any variables in the total patient population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> phase response in diabetics differs by higher leptin levels independent of BMI, gender and IL-6, hsCRP, insulin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
