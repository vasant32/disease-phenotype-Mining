<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) has been shown to effectively improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM), its effects on UAE remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 124 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 61.6 ± 9.2 years) with T2DM were instructed to consume a moderate LCD (1734 ± 416 kcal/d; % carbohydrate:fat:protein = 38:37:19) for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the levels of UAE, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, fasting serum insulin (IRI), and the serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles in the patients and recorded their dosages of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs during this 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 124 patients, 68 were normoalbuminuric, 50 were microalbuminuric, and six were macroalbuminuric at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients had relatively good compliance with the moderate LCD diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 12 months, the mean levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, IRI, homeostasis model assessment-estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and the body mass index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants significantly decreased (P = 0.003 for IRI and P &lt; 0.001 for the other parameters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the microalbuminuric patients (n = 50), remission to normoalbuminuria was frequently achieved (52%) and the geometric mean UAE significantly decreased by 53% (95% confidence interval: 43, 62) over 12 months (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After patients taking an angiotensin 2 receptor blocker were excluded, the UAE significantly decreased by 41% (n = 26, 95% confidence interval: 25, 54; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the reduction in UAE was significantly and positively correlated with a reduction in homeostasis model assessment-estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> levels (r(s) = 0.308; P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A moderate LCD (38% carbohydrate diet) achieved a remarkable reduction in UAE over 12 months in microalbuminuric patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
