<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared two waves of nationwide surveys (n=7541 and n=5599, mainly type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) to examine the trends of ABC control across 5 years in accredited <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Health Promotion Institutes in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of subjects who had HbA1c lower than 7% (A), both SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> lower than 130/80mmHg (B), and total cholesterol lower than 160mg/dl or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> lower than 100mg/dl (C) increased by 6.5% (from 32.4% to 34.5%), 22.0% (from 30.9% to 37.7%), and 57.8% (from 35.3% to 55.7%), respectively, with a resulting total ABC attainment rate from 4.1% to 8.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 720 diabetic subjects who participated in both surveys showed the same pattern of changes in B and C but had a slight deterioration of glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that diagnosis of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, lower BMI and individuals not requiring insulin were independently associated with attainment of ABC goals in 2006 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An accountabilities examination revealed that annular tests of HbA1c, BP and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> above 90% in both surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed an improvement of individual and overall attainments of ABC goals across 5 years in Taiwan owing to recent implementation of several <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care models and initiatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that these improvements will translate into reductions of both macrovascular and microvascular complications </plain></SENT>
