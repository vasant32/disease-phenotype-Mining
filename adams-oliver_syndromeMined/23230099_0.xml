<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 150 type 2 diabetic patients, with disease duration of &lt;1 year and without clinical arteriosclerotic disease or subclinical atherosclerotic signs confirmed by ultrasonographic scanning of three conducting arteries, were randomized into an intensive intervention group and a conventional intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They then received intensive, multifactorial intervention or conventional intervention over 7 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' common carotid intima-media thicknesses (CC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMTs</z:e>) were measured every year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the time to the first occurrence of CC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMTs</z:e> â‰¥1.0 mm and/or development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> plaques in the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome was clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS A total of 70 patients in the intensive group and 68 patients in the conventional group completed the 7-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subclinical macrovascular (primary) outcomes occurred in seven cases in the intensive group and 22 cases in the conventional group for a cumulative prevalence of 10.00 and 32.35%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between the two groups were observed regarding the secondary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Primary prevention of macrovascular diseases can be achieved through intensified, multifactorial intervention in patients with short-duration type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients should undergo intensive multifactorial interventions with individual targets for the prevention of macrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
