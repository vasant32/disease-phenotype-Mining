<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline data of the DIANA-study, a prospective cohort study of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> patients in South-West Germany, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on medication adherence and factors related to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> was obtained by self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> was defined as HbA(1c)â‰¥7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bivariate and multivariate analyses using log-binomial regression were employed to assess overall and gender-specific associations of non-adherence and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 624 men and 518 women were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 147 men (24%) and 114 women (23%) reported non-adherence to medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In men, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> was found in 37% of the participants reporting non-adherence and in 19% reporting adherence (adjusted prevalence ratio (PR)=1.90, 95%-CI: 1.46-2.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> was found in 19% of the participants reporting non-adherence and in 18% reporting adherence (adjusted PR=0.97, 95%-CI: 0.65-1.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show gender-specific differences in the association of adherence and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This underlines the need for efforts to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with a particular focus on men </plain></SENT>
