<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To review clinical trials that have prescribed exercise training in high-risk, ethnic populations with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and delineate areas for future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A systematic review using computerized databases was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The systematic review located nine trials, including four uncontrolled trials, and five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included 521 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cohorts studied included African, Indian, Polynesian, Hispanic, Arabian, and Chinese peoples and interventions included aerobic training, resistance training or a combination thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several trials documented improvements in HbA1c, insulin action, body composition, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and systolic and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, a longer duration and greater frequency of training resulted in greater adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies demonstrating no effect were generally limited by an inadequate intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of differential training responses between Caucasians and non-Caucasians in two studies drawing such comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Robust RCTs prescribing appropriate, targeted interventions and investigating relevant outcomes may be required to stimulate greater advocacy for exercise as a therapeutic adjunct for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management in these populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Investigations should be extended to other high-risk populations, particularly indigenous peoples who suffer an extreme burden of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Translation of research into clinical application should remain the overall objective </plain></SENT>
