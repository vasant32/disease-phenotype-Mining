<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (CAN) in people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> indicates widespread damage to the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, which may severely affect health and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined effects of early detection and subsequent intensive treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in primary care on the prevalence of CAN at the 6-year follow-up examination in a pragmatic cluster-randomised parallel group trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ninety general practices were randomised to deliver either intensive multifactorial treatment (IT) or routine care (RC) as recommended by national guidelines to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, identified through a stepwise screening programme in the primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1533 people (IT, n = 910; RC, n = 623) were identified and included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 6-year follow-up examination, measures of CAN were applied in an unselected subsample of 777 participants using heart rate variability analysis and standard tests of CAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the 6-year follow-up examination, the prevalence of early CAN was 15.1% in the RC group and 15.5% in the IT group, while manifest CAN was present in 7.1% and 7.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no statistically significant effect of intensive treatment on the prevalence of CAN compared with routine care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the Danish arm of the ADDITION Study, signs of CAN were highly prevalent 6 years after a screening-based diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensive multifactorial treatment did not significantly affect the prevalence of CAN compared with routine care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, at follow-up the level of medication was also high in the RC group </plain></SENT>
