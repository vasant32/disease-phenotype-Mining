<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homeostatic model of assessment 2 (HOMA2-IR) and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) were used as indices of IR and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle mass (SkMM) and total fat mass were assessed using bioelectrical impedance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visceral adipose tissue, mid-thigh cross-sectional area, and mid-thigh muscle attenuation were quantified using computed tomography.RESULTSWithin the PRT group, changes in HOMA2-IR were associated with changes in SkMM (r = -0.38; P = 0.04) and fat mass (r = 0.42; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in visceral adipose tissue tended to be related to changes in HOMA2-IR (r = 0.35; P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in HbA1c were related to changes in mid-thigh muscle attenuation (r = 0.52; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of these relationships were present in the sham group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using ANCOVA models, participants in the PRT group who had increased SkMM had decreased HOMA2-IR (P = 0.05) and HbA1c (P = 0.09) compared with those in the PRT group who lost SkMM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increases in SkMM in the PRT group decreased HOMA2-IR (P = 0.07) and HbA1c (P &lt; 0.05) compared with those who had increased SkMM in the sham group.CONCLUSIONSImprovements in metabolic health in older adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were mediated through improvements in body composition only if they were achieved through high-intensity PRT </plain></SENT>
