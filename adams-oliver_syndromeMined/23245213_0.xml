<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have described that the acrophase of diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) registered in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T1D) patients was significantly earlier than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> ecphasia was more pronounced in patients with lower heart rate variability during deep breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the circadian rhythm characteristics of BP among different groups: normotensive (NT) control subjects, patients affected by T1D and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D), and patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We retrospectively evaluated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring records in 30 NT, 20 T1D, 20 T2D, 20 HT whose fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c were contemporaneously measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The four groups were well-matched regarding age, gender, and BMI.Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> midline-estimating statistic of rhythm were higher in T1D, T2D, and HT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> ecphasia was present only in the diabetic individuals: the acrophase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> occurred four hours earlier than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in T1D group, whereas two hours earlier in T2D group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multiple regression analysis, only HbA1c and SBP acrophase were statistically significant correlates of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> acrophase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: People with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, both type 1 and type 2, have their circadian acrophase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> occurring 2-4 hours earlier than normotensive and hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altered circadian timing of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, potential trigger of cardiovascular events, seems to be a distinguishing feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and correlates with the previous 2-3 months of glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
