<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> rates and more active management of risk factors may have abolished the increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to provide an up-to-date assessment of the relative risks associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged people in the U.K.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSUsing data from the General Practice Research Database, from 2004 to 2010, we conducted a cohort study of 87,098 people, 40-65 years of age at baseline, comparing 21,798 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 65,300 without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, matched on age, sex, and general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We produced hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality and compared rates of blood pressure testing, cholesterol monitoring, and use of aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>.RESULTSPeople with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, compared with people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, had a twofold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (HR 2.07 [95% CI 1.95-2.20], adjusted for smoking) and a threefold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (3.25 [2.87-3.68], adjusted for smoking) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women had a higher relative risk than men, and people &lt;55 years of age had a higher relative risk than those &gt;55 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monitoring and medication rates were higher in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONSDespite efforts to manage risk factors, administer effective treatments, and develop new therapies, middle-aged people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain at significantly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
