<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess whether serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short chain fatty acids</z:chebi>, a major by-product of fermentation in gut flora, are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related traits (insulin sensitivity and secretion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short chain fatty acids</z:chebi> levels with measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was assessed using body mass index, computerized tomography scan, and dual <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> X-ray absorptiometry scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were both determined from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and insulin sensitivity was also determined from a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this population of young, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> women, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> was negatively associated with visceral adipose tissue determined by computerized tomography scan and dual <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> X-ray absorptiometry scan, but not body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short chain fatty acids</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, was also negatively associated with fasting serum insulin and 2 hour insulin levels in the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, serum <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> was negatively associated with visceral adipose tissue and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies need to verify these findings and expand on these observations in larger cohorts of subjects </plain></SENT>
