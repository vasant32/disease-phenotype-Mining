<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: to stratify the estimated cardiovascular risk (eCVR) in a population of type 2 diabetics (T2DM) according to the Framingham prediction equations as well as to determine the association between eCVR with metabolic and clinical control of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2000 to 2001 a cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in 13 public out-patients <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/endocrinology clinics from 8 Brazilian cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 10-year risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) was estimated by the prediction equations described by Wilson et al (Circulation 1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> equations were preferably used; when patients missed <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> data we used total cholesterol equations instead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 1382 patients (59.0% female) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median and inter-quartile range (IQ) of age and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 57.4 (51-65) and 8.8 (3-13) years, respectively without differences according to the gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of these patients were overweight and 35.4% were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (the prevalence of higher BMI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in this T2DM group was significantly higher in women than in men; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall estimated eCVR in T2DM patients was 21.4 (13.5-31.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The eCVR was high (&gt; 20%) in 738 (53.4%), intermediate in 202 (14.6%) and low in 442 (32%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Men [25.1(15.4-37.3)] showed a higher eCVR than women [18.8 (12.4-27.9) p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common risk factor was high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (80.8%), most frequently found in women than in men (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median of risk factors present was three (2-4) without gender differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall we observed that 60 (4.3%) of our patients had none, 154(11.1%) one, 310 (22.4%) two, 385 (27.9%) three, 300 (21.7%) four, 149 (10.5%) five and six, (2%) six risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A higher eCVR was noted in overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients (p = 0.01 for both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No association was found between eCVR with age or a specific type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A correlation was found between eCVR and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.001), BMI (p &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> levels (p &lt; 0.001) but it was not found with HbA1c, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and post-prandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A higher eCVR was observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) and a tendency in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: our study showed that in this group of Brazilian T2DM the eCVR was correlated with the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and it was higher in patients with microvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found with glycemic control parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These data could explain the failure of intensive glycemic control programs aiming to reduce cardiovascular events observed in some studies </plain></SENT>
