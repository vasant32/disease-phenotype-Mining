<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and conference proceedings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials with a treatment duration of at least 12 weeks, compared a DPP-4 inhibitor with a placebo as either monotherapy or oral combination therapy, had information on ethnicity and HbA values and were published or described in English </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A systematic review and meta-analysis with a meta-regression analysis was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 809 potentially relevant studies, 55 trials were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis revealed that DPP-4 inhibitors lowered HbA to a greater extent in studies with ≥50% Asian participants (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.92%; 95% CI -1.03, -0.82) than in studies with &lt;50% Asian participants (WMD -0.65%; 95% CI -0.69, -0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The between-group difference was -0.26% (95% CI -0.36, -0.17, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The baseline BMI significantly correlated with the HbA-lowering efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RR of achieving the goal of HbA &lt;7.0% (53.0 mmol/mol) was higher in studies with ≥50% Asian participants (3.4 [95% CI 2.6, 4.7] vs 1.9 [95% CI 1.8, 2.0]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy was higher with monotherapy in the Asian-dominant studies, but the postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy and changes in body weight were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: DPP-4 inhibitors exhibit a better <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy in Asians than in other ethnic groups; this requires further investigation to understand the underlying mechanism, particularly in relation to BMI </plain></SENT>
