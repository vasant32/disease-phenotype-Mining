<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To trace pathological changes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lymphatic vessels in human skin of type 2 diabetic versus non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dermis revealed enhanced lymphatic vessel density, and transcriptional profiling of ex vivo isolated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) identified 180 genes differentially expressed between type 2 diabetic (dLECs) and non-diabetic (ndLECs) LECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic analysis of deregulated genes uncovered sets functionally related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, lymphatic vessel remodelling, lymphangiogenesis and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and small molecule transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, we traced CD68+ macrophage accumulation and concomitant upregulation of TNF-α levels in type 2 diabetic skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-α treatment of LECs and its specific blockade in vitro reproduced differential regulation of a gene set that led to enhanced LEC mobility and macrophage attachment, which was mediated by LEC-derived chemokine CXCL10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study identifies lymph vessel gene signatures directly correlated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> skin manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we provide evidence for a paracrine crosstalk fostering macrophage recruitment to LECs as one pathophysiological process that might contribute to aberrant lymphangiogenesis and persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the skin </plain></SENT>
