<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown that an increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and inflammatory markers are a feature of the patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cross-over study of 26 patients with T2DM taking either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 10 mg was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 months on one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, C-reactive protein (hsCRP), 25OHD and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) were measured repeatedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same procedure was then followed taking the other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite similar <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering, the mean 25OHD was higher on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and the mean <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and hsCRP levels lower, irrespective of which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> the patients were taking before crossover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in 25OHD predicted changes in CRP and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> shows apparently beneficial pleiotropic effects with respect to 25OHD concentrations as well as markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
