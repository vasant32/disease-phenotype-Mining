<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a 12 week, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of salsalate (up to 4 g/day) vs placebo on systemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives included treatment effects on glycaemia, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight participants with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> from two VA healthcare systems were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Randomisation assignment was provided by the coordinating center directly to site pharmacists, and participants and research staff were blinded to treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one individuals were randomised to placebo (n = 36) or salsalate (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> disposal did not change in either group (salsalate 1% [95% CI -39%, 56%]; placebo 6% [95% CI -20%, 61%], p = 0.3 for placebo vs salsalate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was reduced by 6% during the study by salsalate (p = 0.006) but did not change with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Declines in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were accompanied by declines in fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with salsalate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Insulin clearance was reduced with salsalate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the salsalate group, triacylglycerol levels were lower by 25% (p = 0.01) and adiponectin increased by 53% (p = 0.02) at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, endothelial function and other <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adipose tissue nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity declined in the salsalate group compared with placebo (-16% vs 42%, p = 0.005), but was not correlated with metabolic improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> was low but tended to be higher with salsalate therapy (n = 4 vs n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In summary, salsalate therapy was well tolerated, lowered fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, increased adiponectin and reduced adipose tissue NF-κB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These changes were not related to changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity, suggesting additional mechanisms for metabolic improvement </plain></SENT>
