<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals are insulin resistant, which confounds our understanding of the mechanistic link between these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted transcriptome analyses on 835 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects with mean BMI of 48.8, on which we have previously reported genetic associations of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we selected ~320 nondiabetic (HbA(1c) &lt;7.0) subjects and further stratified the cohort into insulin-resistant versus insulin-sensitive subgroups based on homeostasis model assessment-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unsupervised informatics analysis revealed that immune response and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related genes were significantly downregulated in the omental adipose tissue of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals with extreme insulin sensitivity and, to a much lesser extent, in subcutaneous adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, genes related to β-oxidation and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi> cycle were relatively overexpressed in adipose of insulin-sensitive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations were verified by querying an independent cohort of our published dataset of 37 subjects whose subcutaneous adipose tissue was sampled before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas the immune response and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> pathway genes were downregulated by thiazolidinedione treatment, β-oxidation and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="30769">citric acid</z:chebi> cycle genes were upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This work highlights the critical role that omental adipose inflammatory pathways might play in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, independent of body weight </plain></SENT>
