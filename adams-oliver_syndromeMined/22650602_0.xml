<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Available definition criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) have similarities and inconsistencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MS in a group of Cameroonians with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, according to the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria, and to assess the concordance between both criteria, and the implications of combining them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected clinical and biochemical data for 308 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (men 157) at the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> Center of the Yaounde Central Hospital, Cameroon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concordance was assessed with the use of the Kappa statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age (standard deviation) was 55.8 (10.5) years and the median duration of diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (25th-75th percentiles) was 3 years (0.5-5.0), similarly among men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MS was 71.7% according to the IDF criteria and 60.4% according to NCEP-ATP III criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence was significantly higher in women than in men independently of the criteria used (both p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall concordance between both definitions was low to average 0.51 (95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combining the two sets of criteria marginally improved the yield beyond that provided by the IDF criteria alone in men, but not in the overall population and in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IDF and NCEP-ATP III criteria do not always diagnose the same group of diabetic individuals with MS and combining them merely increases the yield beyond that provided by the IDF definition alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the importance of having a single unifying definition for MS in our setting </plain></SENT>
