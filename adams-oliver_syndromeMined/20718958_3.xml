<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in childhood and adolescents have a substantial effect upon many systems, resulting in clinical conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> and the type of body fat distribution are still the core aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and seem to be the physiopathologic links common to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The earlier the appearance of the clustering of risk factors and the higher the time of exposure, the greater will be the chance of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> with a more severe endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age when the event may occur seems to be related to the presence and aggregation of risk factors throughout life.The treatment in this age-group is non pharmacological and aims at promoting changes in lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, pharmacological treatments are indicated in special situations.The major goals in dietary treatments are not only limited to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, but also to an improvement in the quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modification of risk factors associated to comorbidities, personal satisfaction of the child or adolescent and trying to establish healthy life habits from an early age are also important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is a continuous debate on the best possible exercise to do, for children or adolescents, in order to lose weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prescription of physical activity to children and adolescents requires extensive integrated work among multidisciplinary teams, patients and their families, in order to reach therapeutic success.The most important conclusion drawn from this symposium was that if the growing prevalence of overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> continues at this pace, the result will be a population of children and adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This would lead to high mortality rates in young adults, changing the current increasing trend of worldwide longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Government actions and a better understanding of the causes of this problem must be implemented worldwide, by aiming at the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
