<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations of menopausal age and reproductive life span (menopausal age minus menarcheal age) with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were obtained from the InterAct study, a prospective case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,691 postmenopausal type 2 diabetic case subjects and 4,408 subcohort members were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up of 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prentice weighted Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, known risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and reproductive factors, and effect modification by BMI, waist circumference, and smoking was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Mean (SD) age of the subcohort was 59.2 (5.8) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, hazard ratios (HRs) of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 1.32 (95% CI 1.04-1.69), 1.09 (0.90-1.31), 0.97 (0.86-1.10), and 0.85 (0.70-1.03) for women with menopause at ages &lt;40, 40-44, 45-49, and â‰¥55 years, respectively, relative to those with menopause at age 50-54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HR per SD younger age at menopause was 1.08 (1.02-1.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a shorter reproductive life span was associated with a higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk (HR per SD lower reproductive life span 1.06 [1.01-1.12]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No effect modification by BMI, waist circumference, or smoking was observed (P interaction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Early menopause</z:e> is associated with a greater risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
