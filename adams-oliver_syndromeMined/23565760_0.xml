<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of linagliptin as add-on therapy to one approved oral antidiabetes drug (OAD) in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and insufficient glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This 52-week, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group study evaluated once-daily linagliptin 5 mg, as add-on therapy to one OAD (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3095">biguanide</z:chebi>, glinide, glitazone, sulphonylurea [SU] or Î±-glucosidase inhibitors [A-GI]) in 618 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a 2-week run-in, patients on SU or A-GI were randomised to either linagliptin (once daily, 5 mg) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (two- or three-times daily, up to 2250 mg/day) as add-on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving the other OADs received linagliptin add-on therapy (non-randomised) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and rates were similar across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycaemic events were rare, except in the SU group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 26 (5.8%) hypoglycaemic events were reported in patients receiving linagliptin (non-randomised) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycaemic events were similar for linagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> added to A-GI (1/61 versus 2/61, respectively) or SU (17/124 versus 10/63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in HbA1c levels (between -0.66% and -0.92%) occurred throughout the study period for the background therapy groups that received linagliptin (baseline HbA1c 7.86% to 8.12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decline in HbA1c levels was indistinguishable between linagliptin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> groups when administered as add-on therapy to A-GI or SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily linagliptin demonstrated safety and tolerability over 1 year and provided effective add-on therapy leading to significant HbA1c reductions, similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, over 52 weeks in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
