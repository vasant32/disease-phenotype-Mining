<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The comparative effects of liraglutide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> and placebo on energy intake, appetite, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, gastric emptying, antral distension, bodyweight, gastrointestinal hormones, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and resting energy expenditure (REE), were assessed in subjects with T2DM randomised to treatment A (liraglutide-placebo), B (placebo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>) or C (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>-liraglutide) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments were performed at the end of each 4-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Energy intake was less (NS) with liraglutide vs placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, and 24-h REE was higher (NS) with liraglutide vs placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting hunger was less (p=0.01) with liraglutide vs placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, and meal duration was shorter with liraglutide (p=0.002) vs placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">Paracetamol</z:chebi> AUC(0-60 min) and C(max) were less (p&lt;0.01) and fasting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY was lower (p â‰¤ 0.001) after liraglutide vs placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bodyweight reductions of 1.3 and 2.0 kg were observed with liraglutide vs placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences on antral distension, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, or other gastro-intestinal hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Liraglutide caused decreased gastric emptying and <z:mp ids='MP_0003187'>increased reduction</z:mp> in bodyweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of the liraglutide-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> may involve a combined effect on energy intake and energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
