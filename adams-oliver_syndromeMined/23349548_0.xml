<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To optimize glycemic control, real-time CGM readings were evaluated by a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> caregiver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c), self-monitored plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, and pregnancy outcomes were recorded, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large-for-gestational-age</z:hpo> infants as the primary outcome.RESULTSWomen assigned to real-time CGM (n = 79) had similar baseline HbA(1c) as women in the control arm (n = 75) (median 6.6 [range 5.3-10.0] vs. 6.8% [5.3-10.7]; P = 0.67) (49 [34-86] vs. 51 mmol/mol [34-93]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (64%) women used real-time CGM per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 33 weeks, HbA(1c) (6.1 [5.1-7.8] vs. 6.1% [4.8-8.2]; P = 0.39) (43 [32-62] vs. 43 mmol/mol [29-66]) and self-monitored plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (6.2 [4.7-7.9] vs. 6.2 mmol/L [4.9-7.9]; P = 0.64) were comparable regardless of real-time CGM use, and a similar fraction of women had experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (16 vs. 16%; P = 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>large-for-gestational-age</z:hpo> infants (45 vs. 34%; P = 0.19) and other perinatal outcomes were comparable between the arms.CONCLUSIONSIn this randomized trial, intermittent use of real-time CGM in pregnancy, in addition to self-monitored plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> seven times daily, did not improve glycemic control or pregnancy outcome in women with pregestational <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
