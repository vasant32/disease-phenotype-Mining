<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate self-monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (SMBG) behaviour among non-insulin treated patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and to evaluate associations with glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients in 23 GP practices in Tayside, Scotland, were identified (18-75 years, no insulin treatment, SMBG reagent strips dispensed in 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consenting patients were administered questionnaires addressing SMBG behaviour: these primary data were record-linked to clinical data (including HbA1c) from a validated population-based <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinical information system, then anonymised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 629 eligible patients, 207 were interviewed and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean SMBG reagent strips dispensed in 12 months was 268 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In response to a perceived high test result, 80 (38.8%) patients took no action or simply checked later with most of them (61.3%) indicating they did not know what action to take </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 126 (61.2%) patients who took some action, 101 made changes to diet, 12 increased physical activity, 10 made changes to medication and 12 mad a HCP appointment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high score on a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Knowledge Test was a statistically significant predictor of taking action (odds ratio: 2.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, neither taking action nor increased SMBG frequency was associated with improved glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Responding to SMBG test results and increased testing frequency were not associated with improved glycaemic control in the short-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is a lack of knowledge surrounding SMBG in non-insulin treated patients </plain></SENT>
