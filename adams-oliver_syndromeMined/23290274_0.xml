<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-nine subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance (NGT) and 87 subjects with T2DM were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NGT and T2DM groups were divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (NW) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (OB) subgroups separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric parameters such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of SFRP5, IL-6, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1C)) and fasting insulin (FINS) levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (IR) was assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma SFRP5 levels were lower in T2DM group than in NGT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of plasma SFRP5 in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were also lower than those in subjects with NW in both NGT and T2DM groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T2DM-OB subgroup had lower plasma SFRP5 levels than that in NGT-OB subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma SFRP5 levels were negatively correlated with BMI, WC, WHR, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA(1C), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), FINS, HOMA-IR and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that HOMA-IR, BMI and TG were independently related with plasma SFRP5 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of SFRP5 were decreased in Chinese <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and T2DM subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SFRP5 was an independent factor affecting glucolipid metabolism, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and T2DM </plain></SENT>
