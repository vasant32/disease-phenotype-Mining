<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of taspoglutide versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with sulphonylurea ± <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial, 760 subjects (49% male, age 56.4 years, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 8.8 years, body mass index 32.7 kg/m(2) and <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c [HbA1c] 8.3%) were randomized (1 : 1 : 1) to subcutaneous injections of taspoglutide 10 or 20 mg once weekly or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> 45 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c after 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (±s.e.) HbA1c reductions with taspoglutide 10 (-1.18 ± 0.08%) and 20 mg (-1.36 ± 0.08%) were non-inferior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (-1.30 ± 0.08%) (p = 0.21 and 0.37, respectively); mean treatment differences were 0.12 (95% confidence interval: -0.03, -0.26) and -0.06 (-0.20, 0.08) for taspoglutide 10 and 20 mg versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean (±s.e.) changes in body weight (kg) were -0.8 ± 0.3, -1.0 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.3 for taspoglutide 10 and 20 mg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, respectively; 8, 11 and 1% of patients achieved ≥5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher incidence of adverse events (AEs) occurred with taspoglutide, predominantly gastrointestinal disturbances and injection-site reactions, resulting in higher rates of discontinuation versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No treatment differences in serious AEs were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taspoglutide offered good glycaemic control similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi>, while achieving beneficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> rather than <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, but was associated with more AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to the higher than expected discontinuation rates, mainly because of gastrointestinal intolerability, the taspoglutide clinical programme was stopped </plain></SENT>
