<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association signal in JAZF1 intron 1, we hypothesized that the underlying risk variants have cis-regulatory effects in islets or other type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-relevant cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used maps of experimentally predicted open chromatin regions to prioritize variants for functional follow-up studies of transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve regions containing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated variants were tested for enhancer activity in 832/13 and MIN6 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021670" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">insulinoma</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three regions exhibited enhancer activity and only rs1635852 displayed allelic differences in enhancer activity; the type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk allele T showed lower transcriptional activity than the nonrisk allele C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This risk allele showed increased binding to protein complexes, suggesting that it functions as part of a transcriptional repressor complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We applied DNA affinity capture to identify factors in the complex and determined that the risk allele preferentially binds the pancreatic master regulator PDX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the rs1635852 region in JAZF1 intron 1 is part of a cis-regulatory complex and that maps of open chromatin are useful to guide identification of variants with allelic differences in regulatory activity at type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci </plain></SENT>
