<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These compunds modulate the immuno-enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and the blood levels of several identified inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent research into the pathology of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> implicates inflammatory factors in the progression of the disease, leading the authors to study its possible control by one of the calcium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26374">pterins</z:chebi>, dipterinyl calcium pentahydrate (DCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The investigators tested DCP as a novel therapeutic for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female C57BL/6 J mice with diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were fed a high-fat diet and were administered DCP in 0.4% carboxymethylcellulose for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was followed during the dosing period, and an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out on day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements of plasma indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase metabolites (tryptophan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi>) and certain cytokines and chemokines were also taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DCP 7 mg/kg/day reduced OGTT area under the curve (OGTT/ AUC) by 50% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant multivariate regression (P = 0.013; R(2) = 0.571) of OGTT/ AUC was derived from DCP dosage and plasma Trp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated plasma Trp concentration, likely from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in diet and/or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, was found to correlate with higher OGTT/AUC diabetic measures, possibly via inhibition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an optimum dose of DCP 7 mg/kg/day significantly improved the OGTT diabetic state in these female diet-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
