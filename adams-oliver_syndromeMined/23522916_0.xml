<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Toe brachial index (TBI) was cross-sectionally analyzed in 742 middle-aged (54-66 years) patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> as well as non-diabetic controls and related to other vascular measures (e.g. carotid intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), presence of carotid plaque, central arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass index) and previous cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A TBI=0.7 was seen in 22% of the patients but only one patient had severe TBI reduction (TBI=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures in the controls were 13% and 0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean TBI was significantly lower in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than in controls (0.81±0.14 vs. 0.87±0.15, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a lower TBI was associated with increased central arterial stiffness (p&lt;0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (p&lt;0.001) and carotid plaque (p&lt;0.001) as well as with decreasing glomerular filtration rate (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower TBI was found in patients with previous macrovascular ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TBI was negatively correlated with age (p&lt;0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration (p&lt;0.001) and HbA1c (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PAD, assessed with TBI, is common in a Swedish middle-aged <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> type 2 cohort, affecting about one-fifth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As ankle pressure may be confounded by falsely high values in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> due to media calcification we conclude that information about TBI may improve the risk evaluation regarding arteriosclerotic disease in both small and large vessels in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
