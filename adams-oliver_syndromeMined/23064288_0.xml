<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used an embryo-transfer approach, with fertilised GK/Par ovocytes (oGK) being transferred into pregnant Wistar (W) or GK/Par females (pW and pGK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Offspring were phenotyped at fetal age E18.5 and at 10Â weeks of age, for BCM, expression of genes of pancreatic progenitor cell regulators (Igf2, Igf1r, Sox9, Pdx1 and Ngn3), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Alterations in neogenesis markers/regulators and BCM were as severe in the oGK/pW E18.5 fetuses as in the oGK/pGK group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Adult offspring from oGK transfers into GK (oGK/pGK/sGK) had the expected diabetic phenotype compared with unmanipulated GK rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) Adult offspring from oGK reared in pW mothers and milked by GK foster mothers had reduced BCM, basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and low insulin, to an extent similar to that of oGK/pGK/sGK offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) In adult offspring from oGK transferred into pW mothers and milked by their W mothers (oGK/pW/sW), the phenotype was similar to that in oGK/pGK/sGK or oGK/pW/sGK offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data support the conclusion that early BCM alteration and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in the GK/Par model are not removed despite normalisation of the prenatal and postnatal environments, either isolated or combined </plain></SENT>
