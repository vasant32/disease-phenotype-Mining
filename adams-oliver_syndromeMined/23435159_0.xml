<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with basal bolus and basal plus regimens resulted in less treatment failure (defined as &gt;2 consecutive BG &gt;240 mg/dL or a mean daily BG &gt;240 mg/dL) than did treatment with SSI (0 vs. 2 vs. 19%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A BG &lt;70 mg/dL occurred in 16% of patients in the basal bolus group, 13% in the basal plus group, and 3% in the SSI group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference among the groups in the frequency of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (&lt;40 mg/dL; P = 0.76).CONCLUSIONSThe use of a basal plus regimen with glargine once daily plus corrective doses with glulisine insulin before meals resulted in glycemic control similar to a standard basal bolus regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basal plus approach is an effective alternative to the use of a basal bolus regimen in general medical and surgical patients with T2D </plain></SENT>
