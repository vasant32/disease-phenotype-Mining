<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 8640 subjects who met inclusion criteria, 75% (N1=6480) were randomly selected to provide training set for constructing artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariate logistic regression (MLR) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 25% (N2=2160) were assigned to validation set for performance comparisons of the ANN and MLR models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictive performance of different models was analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence rates of T2DM were 8.66% (n=561) and 9.21% (n=199) in training and validation sets, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For ANN model, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for identifying T2DM were 86.93%, 79.14%, 31.86%, and 98.18%, respectively, while MLR model were only 60.80%, 75.48%, 21.78%, and 94.52%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Area under the ROC curve (AUC) value for identifying T2DM when using the ANN model was 0.891, showing more accurate predictive performance than the MLR model (AUC=0.744) (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ANN model is an effective classification approach for identifying those at high risk of T2DM based on demographic, lifestyle and anthropometric data </plain></SENT>
