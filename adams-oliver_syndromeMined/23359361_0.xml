<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of a low-energy d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi> preload, with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, on gastric emptying, plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations, and postprandial glycemia in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSTwelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (S) or placebo (P) and an overnight fast, patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi> (X) or 80 mg sucralose (control <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29435">[C]</z:chebi>), followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with (13)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25646">octanoate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled at intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastric emptying was determined.RESULTSBoth peak blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC (P &lt; 0.01 for each) and were lowest after SX (P &lt; 0.05 for each), while overall blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was lower after SX than PC (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postprandial insulin-to-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio was attenuated (P &lt; 0.05) and gastric emptying was slower (P &lt; 0.01) after d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi>, without any effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi> than control only before the meal (P &lt; 0.05) but were sustained postprandially when combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONSIn type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of a d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi> preload reduces postprandial glycemia and enhances the effect of a DPP-4 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
