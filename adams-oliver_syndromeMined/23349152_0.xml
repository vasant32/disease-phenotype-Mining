<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, controlled trials, and unpublished data was conducted to examine the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of each report based on predefined inclusion criteria (study design and measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and IR, excluding prevalent cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual effect sizes were standardized, and a meta-analysis was performed to calculate a pooled effect size using random effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to explore any potential source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 967 abstracts reviewed, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria of which 18 studies had appropriate data for the meta-analysis (n = 25,847) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pooled effect size (95% CI) was 0.19 (0.11-0.27) with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (I(2) = 82.2%) using the random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies was not explained by age or sex, but could be partly explained by the methods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and IR assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A small but significant cross-sectional association was observed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and IR, despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology mechanisms and direction of this association need further study using a purposively designed prospective or intervention study in samples at high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
