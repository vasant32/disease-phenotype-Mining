<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent genome-wide association study identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-α (HNF1A) as a key regulator of fucosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that loss-of-function HNF1A mutations causal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY) would display altered fucosylation of N-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> on plasma proteins and that glycan biomarkers could improve the efficiency of a diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a pilot comparison of 33 subjects with HNF1A-MODY and 41 subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 15 of 29 glycan measurements differed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DG9-glycan index, which is the ratio of fucosylated to nonfucosylated triantennary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, provided optimum discrimination in the pilot study and was examined further among additional subjects with HNF1A-MODY (n = 188), glucokinase (GCK)-MODY (n = 118), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-α (HNF4A)-MODY (n = 40), type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 98), type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 167), and nondiabetic controls (n = 98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DG9-glycan index was markedly lower in HNF1A-MODY than in controls or other <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subtypes, offered good discrimination between HNF1A-MODY and both type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (C statistic ≥0.90), and enabled us to detect three previously undetected HNF1A mutations in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, glycan profiles are altered substantially in HNF1A-MODY, and the DG9-glycan index has potential clinical value as a diagnostic biomarker of HNF1A dysfunction </plain></SENT>
