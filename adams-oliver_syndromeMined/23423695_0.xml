<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether a group of patients with partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> of the limbs (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>), type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), and an absence of a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> constitute a new clinical subtype.RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODSTen women with T2DM and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> were identified in academic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics and were matched by age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status with 10 women with control T2DM without <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were characterized by clinical evaluation and hyperinsulinemic clamp.RESULTSPatients with T2DM and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> exhibited symmetrical loss of subcutaneous fat in forearms, or forearms plus calves, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximally stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rates were markedly reduced by 56% in the T2DM with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> group compared with the control T2DM patients, whether normalized by body weight or surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> patients exhibited little or no insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake after subtraction of non-insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T2DM with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> group also had greater elevations in hepatic transaminases and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with control T2DM.CONCLUSIONST2DM with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> represents a previously unrecognized phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> and of T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These T2DM patients exhibit symmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> of the distal limbs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with little insulin-mediated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and hepatic transaminase elevations, which are greater in severity than observed in patients with common T2DM </plain></SENT>
