<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital inpatient and outpatient records were reviewed for cases of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The secondary source of validation was the School District of Philadelphia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time series analysis was used to evaluate the changing pattern of incidence over the 20-year period.RESULTSThe overall age-adjusted incidence rate in 2000-2004 of 17.0 per 100,000 per year was significantly higher than that of previous cohorts, with an average yearly increase of 1.5% and an average 5-year cohort increase of 7.8% (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence in white children (19.2 per 100,000 per year) was 48% higher than in the previous cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children aged 0-4 years had a 70% higher incidence (12.2 per 100,000 per year) than the original cohort; this increase was most marked in young black children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall age-adjusted incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 5.8 per 100,000 per year and was significantly higher in black children.CONCLUSIONSThe incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is rising among children in Philadelphia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate has increased by 29% since the 1985-1989 cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most marked increases were among white children ages 10-14 years and black children ages 0-4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is 18 times higher than that of type 2 in white children but only 1.6 times higher in black children </plain></SENT>
