<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> stimulating insulin secretion are under investigation for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, genome-wide association studies did not discover <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk variants in FFAR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reevaluated the role of FFAR1 in insulin secretion using a specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, FFAR1-knockout mice and human islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nondiabetic individuals were metabolically phenotyped and genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments indicated that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and a specific FFAR1-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, TUG-469, stimulate <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion through FFAR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pro-apoptotic effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure of beta-cells to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> was independent of FFAR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TUG-469 was protective, while inhibition of FFAR1 promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the pro-apoptotic effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>, in vivo crosssectional observations demonstrated a negative association between fasting free fatty acids (NEFA) and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As NEFA stimulate secretion through FFAR1, we examined the interaction of genetic variation in FFAR1 with NEFA and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inverse association of NEFA and secretion was modulated by rs1573611 and became steeper for carriers of the minor allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FFAR1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> support beta-cell function, but variation in FFAR1 influences NEFA effects on insulin secretion and could, therefore, affect therapeutic efficacy of FFAR1-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
