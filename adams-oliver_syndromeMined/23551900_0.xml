<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A literature search was conducted with PubMed using predefined search terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were included if they met the following criteria: randomized, controlled trial; comparison of insulin detemir with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> insulin; non-hospitalized adults aged ≥18 years with either type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; and study duration of ≥12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following types of studies were excluded: non-randomized controlled trials; studies of mixed cohorts of patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that did not report results separately; pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies; reviews, or pooled or meta-analyses; or health-economic analyses.14 publications met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine studies in people with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and three studies in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, using insulin detemir in a basal-bolus regimen, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two studies were in people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> using insulin detemir with oral antidiabetes medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 14 studies of people with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, insulin detemir treatment provided similar or better glycaemic control, lower within-subject variability, similar or lower frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and less <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> when compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin </plain></SENT>
