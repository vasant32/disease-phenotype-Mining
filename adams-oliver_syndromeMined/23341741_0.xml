<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational, systematic audit of patients with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from 40 primary care practices was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The audit collected basic demographic information and data on prescriptions issued during the preceding 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2DM patients were stratified according to the proportion that attained European Society of Cardiology treatment targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The audit collected data from 14,652 patients with diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>: 89.5% (n = 13,108) of the total cohort had T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the people with T2DM, 22.2% (2916) were not currently receiving <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Up to approximately 80% of these people showed evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the group that received <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapy, 94.7% (9647) were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy, which was usually <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (69.5% of patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy; 6707) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The currently available <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were prescribed, with the most common dose being 40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (44.2%; 4267) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> used, around half of the patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy did not attain the European Society of Cardiology treatment targets for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and total cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: T2DM patients managed in UK primary care commonly show persistent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinicians need to optimize compliance with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering and other medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinicians also need to consider intensifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> regimens, prescribing additional <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>- modifying therapies, and specific treatments aimed at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> lowering to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> control in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-treated patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
