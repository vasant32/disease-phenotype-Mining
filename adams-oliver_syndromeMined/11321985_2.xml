<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made at birth and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> cutis was associated with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defects</z:hpo>, exposing the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differences between the two patients were essentially the extension and the severity of the scalp and limb osteo-cutaneous lesions, associated malformations of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one child we found focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> of the right hemisphere and in the other one the syndrome was complicated by encephaloclastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> and encephalic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both children have survived, but the diagnosis of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system malformations and the encephaloclastic lesions associated modified the initial prognosis and the future outcome conspicuously </plain></SENT>
