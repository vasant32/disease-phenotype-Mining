<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the associations between proinsulin and 20 year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed within the Hoorn Study, a population-based study of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in individuals aged 50-75 years in the Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting proinsulin levels were measured twice by a double-antibody radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were continuously followed to register mortality; causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were derived from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox survival analyses were performed to assess the 20 year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in relation to proinsulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> analyses were adjusted for age and sex, with additional adjustments for traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect modification of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and sex was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proinsulin levels were measured in 438 individuals (41% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 35.7% impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, 23.3% type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these participants, 53 died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and sex, proinsulin &gt;16.5 pmol/l (the upper tertile) was significantly associated with a twofold risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.16, 3.46) compared with individuals with lower proinsulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustment for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, BMI and smoking did not substantially change the results (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04, 3.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No interaction with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism or sex was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Individuals with fasting proinsulin levels &gt;16.5 pmol/l have a twofold risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality over a 20 year time span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings provide population-based evidence for the independent association between high proinsulin levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality rates </plain></SENT>
