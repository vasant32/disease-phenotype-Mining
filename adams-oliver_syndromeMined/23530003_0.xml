<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The carotid bodies (CB) are peripheral chemoreceptors that classically respond to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> by increasing chemosensory activity in the carotid sinus nerve (CSN), causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> and activation of the sympathoadrenal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides its role in the control of ventilation, the CB has been proposed as a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensor being implicated in the control of energy homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, to date no studies have anticipated its role in the development of IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein we propose that CB overstimulation is involved in the aetiology of IR and HT, core metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances of highly prevalent diseases like the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated CB activity is increased in IR animal models and that CSN resection prevents CB-overactivation and diet-induced IR and HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover we showed that insulin triggers CB, highlighting a new role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> as a stimulus for CB-overactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that CB is implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances through sympathoadrenal overactivation and may represent a novel therapeutic target in these diseases </plain></SENT>
