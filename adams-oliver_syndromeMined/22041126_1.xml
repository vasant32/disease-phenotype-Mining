<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized for high intensity aerobic training (HI: 80% maximum heart rate, n=10), low intensity aerobic training (LI: 55% of maximum heart rate, n=10) and control (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before and after 6 weeks of training, subjects performed the maximal exercise test and a study of the endothelial function, through a high resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery, which was assessed after reactive hyperemia (endothelium dependent vasodilation) and nitrate administration (endothelium independent vasodilation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were studied, with mean age of 58±6 years, The percentage diameter difference of the vessel after hyperemia was significantly higher for the high intensity group (HI before 2.52±2.85% and after 31.81±12.21%; LI before 3.23±3.52% and after 20.61±7.76%; controls before 3.56±2.33% and after 2.43±2.14%; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High intensity aerobic training improved the functional capability and endothelium dependent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> response, but it does not improve the endothelium independent vasodilation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
