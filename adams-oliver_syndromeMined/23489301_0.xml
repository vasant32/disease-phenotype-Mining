<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there have been concerns that some classes or agents for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may increase CV risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor alogliptin affects CV risk by evaluating the incidence of CV events in patients treated with alogliptin, placebo or comparator anti-hyperglycemic drugs in the clinical trial database for alogliptin using the composite major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) end points of CV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pooled analysis included 4,168 patients exposed to alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg daily for 2023 patient-years compared to 691 patients treated with placebo for 263 patient-years and 1,169 patients treated with other anti-diabetic agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi>) for 703 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events were adjudicated by an expert endpoint committee blinded to treatment allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates of the combined MACE were not significantly different between patients treated with alogliptin and comparator therapies (hazard ratio = 0.635, 95% CI, 0.0, 1.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, other types of serious CV events were not significantly different between patients treated with alogliptin and comparator therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these analyses have not demonstrated a signal of increased CV risk with alogliptin in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future results from the adequately powered EXAMINE trial will definitively assess the CV safety profile of aloglipin in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
