<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between beliefs of physicians relative to intensive metabolic control in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and levels of HbA1c obtained in a sample of their patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Physicians' beliefs were investigated through a questionnaire sent to a sample of self-selected clinicians participating in a nationwide initiative aimed at assessing the relationship between the quality of care delivered to patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and their outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, physicians were asked to collect clinical data on a random sample of their patients, stratified by age (&lt;65 vs. &gt; or = 65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean HbA1c levels in the study population were thus evaluated according to target fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) used by their physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 456 physicians, 342 (75%) returned the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the responders, 200 diabetologists and 99 general practitioners (GPs) recruited 3,297 patients; 2,003 of whom were always followed by the same physician and 1,294 of whom were seen by different physicians in the same structure on different occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 14% of the respondents used target FBG levels &lt; or = 6.1 mmol/l, whereas 38% pursued values &gt;7.8 mmol/l, with no statistically significant difference between diabetologists and GPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the relationship between FBG targets and metabolic control, restricted to those patients always seen by the same physician, showed a strong linear association, with mean HbA1c values of 7.0 +/- 1.6 for patients in the charge of physicians pursuing FBG levels &lt; or = 6.1 mmol/l and 7.8 +/- 1.8 for those followed by physicians who used target values &gt;7.8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for patients' and physicians' characteristics, the risk of having HbA1c values &gt; 7.0% was highly correlated with physicians' beliefs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients followed by different physicians in the same unit showed a risk of inadequate metabolic control similar to that of patients followed by physicians adopting a nonaggressive policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Doctors adopt extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> target FBG levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which in turn represent an important independent predictor of metabolic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To improve patient outcomes, physicians-centered educational activities aimed at increasing the awareness of the potential benefits of a tight metabolic control in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
