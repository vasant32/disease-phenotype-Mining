<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase (GCK) cause a mild hereditary form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> termed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY)2 or GCK-MODY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease does not progress over time, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications rarely develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has therefore been suggested that GCK-MODY represents a metabolically compensated condition, but experimental support for this notion is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we profiled metabolites in serum from patients with MODY1 (HNF4A), MODY2 (GCK), MODY3 (HNF1A), and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and from healthy individuals to characterize metabolic perturbations caused by specific mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of four GCK-MODY patients revealed a metabolite pattern similar to that of healthy individuals, while other forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> differed markedly in their metabolite profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations, carriers of GCK mutations showed lower levels of free fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> than healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The metabolite profiling was confirmed by enzymatic assays and replicated in a cohort of 11 GCK-MODY patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of fatty acids are known to associate with Î²-cell dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and increased incidence of late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that GCK-MODY represents a metabolically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition, which may contribute to the lack of late complications and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> nature of the disease </plain></SENT>
