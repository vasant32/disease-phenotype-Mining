<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a neutral, ultralong-acting new generation basal insulin analog developed by NovoNordisk currently in Phase III clinical development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IDeg offers a duration of action of more than 42 hours in adults, much longer than current basal insulin formulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety data of IDeg in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relevant English language articles from 2010 to 2012 were identified through MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, BIOSIS, and Google Scholar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Online conference proceedings of the 71st <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> Scientific Sessions and the 47th EASD Annual Meeting were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies were compared in terms of their study designs, primary and secondary efficacy parameters, and tolerability data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There are a total of nine published trials investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of IDeg in over 3000 subjects with type 1 and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only three trials were published in full </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were open-label, randomized multicenter trials with durations of 16 to 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IDeg and coformulations of IDeg with insulin aspart (IAsp) were compared to insulin glargine (IGlar), detemir, and biphasic IAsp 30 (BIAsp 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based upon the available evidence, there appear to be no reported differences between IDeg and IGlar, detemir, or BIAsp 30 in the reduction of the primary efficacy end-points of HbA(1c) and mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only flexible dosing of IDeg provided a significant reduction in FPG compared to IGlar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IDeg demonstrated a significant reduction in nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, IDeg reduced the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> by 18% and 58% compared to IGlar and BIAsp 30, respectively </plain></SENT>
