<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity and concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in aqueous humor from patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aqueous humor was obtained during elective <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery from T2DM patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reducing response was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> dye reduction and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by chemiluminescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> dibutyrate (PDB)-stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokines were quantified by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity of aqueous humor from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was greater (P&lt;0.05) than that of healthy controls or persons with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ROS production in PDB (protein kinase C activator)-stimulated granulocytes from T2DM patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> was inhibited by autologous aqueous humor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of VEGF and IL-6 were similar in aqueous humor from healthy controls and from patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, but lower (P&lt;0.05) than those from T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of VEGF and IL-6 were similar (P&gt;0.05) in healthy controls and in T2DM patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aqueous humor from T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> exhibits elevated <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity with significant suppressive effect on ROS production and enhanced levels of locally secreted VEGF and IL-6 in comparison with T2DM patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an inflammatory profile in the absence of typical <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> for T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, possibly resulting from the compensatory <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> response detected in the aqueous humor improving the ocular redox state </plain></SENT>
