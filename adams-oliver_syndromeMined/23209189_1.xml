<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of T2D in 12,535 Indians, a less explored but high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified a new type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-associated locus at 2q21, with the lead signal being rs6723108 (odds ratio 1.31; P = 3.32 × 10(-9)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imputation analysis refined the signal to rs998451 (odds ratio 1.56; P = 6.3 × 10(-12)) within TMEM163 that encodes a probable vesicular transporter in nerve terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TMEM163 variants also showed association with decreased fasting plasma insulin and homeostatic model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, indicating a plausible effect through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2q21 region also harbors RAB3GAP1 and ACMSD; those are involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine of 56 previously reported signals showed consistency in direction with similar effect sizes in Indians and previous studies, and 25 of them were also associated (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Known loci and the newly identified 2q21 locus altogether explained 7.65% variance in the risk of T2D in Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that common susceptibility variants for T2D are largely the same across populations, but also reveals a population-specific locus and provides further insights into genetic architecture and etiology of T2D </plain></SENT>
