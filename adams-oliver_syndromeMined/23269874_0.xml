<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum lipase and pancreatic amylase concentrations are used in conjunction with clinical findings to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In two large clinical trials of overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects, lipase and pancreatic amylase were measured at screening and 2-5 weeks later at baseline (prior to treatment with study medication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lipase and pancreatic amylase concentrations were above the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (ULN) in 13% and 6% of type 2 diabetic subjects, respectively, and were approximately three-fold (3 ×) higher than the proportion of nondiabetic subjects with levels above ULN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevations exceeding ULN were seen in many subjects asymptomatic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>; however, elevations &gt;2 × ULN and &gt;3 × ULN were uncommon, and elevations &gt;3 × ULN were often associated with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, enzyme concentrations varied within this 2-5-week screening period, including shifts between elevated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results from this post hoc analysis suggest that, although pancreatic enzymes can be a useful marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> within the proper clinical context, diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> may be confounded in populations known to have asymptomatic elevations associated with disease, such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further effort is needed to clarify the etiology and epidemiology of pancreatic enzyme elevations in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
