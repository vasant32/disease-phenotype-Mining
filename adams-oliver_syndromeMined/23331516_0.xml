<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, SGLT2 is a low-affinity, high-capacity transporter that is expressed predominantly in the proximal renal tubules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rationale for using SGLT2 inhibition as a drug for T2DM is derived from early evidence obtained from individuals with familial renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo>, due to a SGLT2 mutation, which exhibits decreased renal tubular reabsorption of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> or any other signs of dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, reduction of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reabsorption by SGLT2 inhibition represents a novel T2DM treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In light of the emerging role of SGLT2 inhibition in controlling <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, the current review provides a critical appraisal of the rationale, overviews of structural differences between SGLT2 inhibitors and summarizes recent preclinical and clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The physiological actions of SGLT2 inhibition in relation to insulin sensitivity, islet <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, body weight and blood pressure are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the safety and tolerability of SGLT2 inhibitors are also discussed in relation to their potential to provide insulin independence and enhance Î²-cell function, as well as their potential for synergistic/additive effects if used in combination with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
