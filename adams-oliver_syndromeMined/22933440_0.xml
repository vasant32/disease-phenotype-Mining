<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Regional brain volumes and ischemic lesion volumes in 1,366 women, aged 72-89 years, were measured with structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat scans were collected an average of 4.7 years later in 698 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional differences and changes with time between women with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relationships that cognitive function test scores had with these measures and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 145 women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (10.6%) at the first MRI had smaller total brain volumes (0.6% less; P = 0.05) and smaller gray matter volumes (1.5% less; P = 0.01) but not white matter volumes, both overall and within major lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also had larger ischemic lesion volumes (21.8% greater; P = 0.02), both overall and in gray matter (27.5% greater; P = 0.06), in white matter (18.8% greater; P = 0.02), and across major lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, women with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had slightly (nonsignificant) greater loss of total brain volumes (3.02 cc; P = 0.11) and significant increases in total ischemic lesion volumes (9.7% more; P = 0.05) with time relative to those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was associated with lower scores in global cognitive function and its subdomains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These relative deficits were only partially accounted for by brain volumes and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is associated with smaller brain volumes in gray but not white matter and increasing ischemic lesion volumes throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These markers are associated with but do not fully account for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related deficits in cognitive function </plain></SENT>
