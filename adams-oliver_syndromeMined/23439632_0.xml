<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assessment of β-cell function (mixed meal tolerance testing) and body composition were performed at baseline and 12 and 24 months.RESULTSGlycemic control improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups at 24 months (N = 54), with a mean HbA(1c) of 6.7 ± 1.2% for gastric bypass, 7.1 ± 0.8% for sleeve gastrectomy, and 8.4 ± 2.3% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05 for each surgical group versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduction in body fat was similar for both surgery groups, with greater absolute reduction in truncal fat in gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy (-16 vs. -10%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity increased significantly from baseline in gastric bypass (2.7-fold; P = 0.004) and did not change in sleeve gastrectomy or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>. β-cell function (oral disposition index) increased 5.8-fold in gastric bypass from baseline, was markedly greater than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P = 0.001), and was not different between sleeve gastrectomy versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 24 months, β-cell function inversely correlated with truncal fat and prandial free fatty acid levels.CONCLUSIONSBariatric surgery provides durable glycemic control compared with intensive medical therapy at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> as sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass uniquely restores pancreatic β-cell function and reduces truncal fat, thus reversing the core defects in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
