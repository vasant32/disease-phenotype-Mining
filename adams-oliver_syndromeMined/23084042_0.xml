<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin also plays a role in the suppression of the metabolic derangements in type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> fluctuations can alter blood levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 34 patients with type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a measure of short-term glycemic variability, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) was computed from a continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitor system (CGMS), and data were recorded over 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For long-term glycemic variability, we calculated the standard deviation (SD) of HbA1c over a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> and adiponectin levels were measured after completing the 72-h CGMS data collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blood levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> were significantly and negatively correlated with MAGE (r = -0.543; P &lt; 0.001), but not with HbA1c and SD of HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were also significantly and negatively correlated with MAGE and SD of HbA1c (r = -0.64 and r = -0.55, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using generalized estimating equations, multivariate regression analysis revealed that MAGE is an independent predictor of serum levels of adiponectin (P = 0.002) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found strong associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> variability, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, and adiponectin in type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agent</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
