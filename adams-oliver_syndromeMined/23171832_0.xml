<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty seven overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men with (n = 19, age = 54.2 ± 7.4 yrs, BMI = 32.3 ± 6.7 kg⋅m-2) and without T2DM (n = 38, age = 51.1 ± 6.8 yrs, BMI = 29.9 ± 4.5kg⋅m-2, p &gt; 0.05 between groups) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The men completed measures of depressed mood and health-related quality of life (HRQL) and underwent the following assessments: fasting blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, HbA1c, anthropometric measurements, VO2peak, muscle strength, and physical function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to men without T2DM, men with T2DM had higher depressed mood (p = 0.05, η2 = 0.07), as well as lower perceived general health (p &lt; .01, η2 = 0.24) and social functioning (p = .01, η2 = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men with T2DM also had lower VO2peak (21.8 ± 5.3 versus 25.8 ± 5.4 ml⋅kg-1⋅min-1, p &lt; .01, η2 = 0.11) and muscle strength (3.3 ± 0.8 versus 3.7 ± 0.7 kg⋅kg-1, p = 0.08, η2 = 0.06), as well as being slower to complete physical performance tasks (27.2 ± 5.2 versus 24.2 ± 2.8 sec, p &lt; 0.01, η2 = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those with T2DM, depressed mood was highly correlated with most HRQL subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the combined cohort, depressed mood was correlated with fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (r = 0.31, p = 0.012) but not the functional measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Men with T2DM have higher levels of depressed mood compared to men without T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glycaemic control, but not functional capacities, is associated with depressed mood in the study cohort </plain></SENT>
