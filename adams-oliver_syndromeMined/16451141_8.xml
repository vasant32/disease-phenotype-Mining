<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms observed in these patients were very variable as previously reported in other families and included large areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> on the vertex of the skull and serious limb reduction defects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> toes of one foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the disease-causing gene, we sequenced the MSX1, CART1, P63 (P73L), RUNX2, and HOXD13 genes in this family and nine previously reported families, but no disease-causing mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is ongoing in these families in order to identify the genetic cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
