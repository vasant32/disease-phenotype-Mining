<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVEThe <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> excretion rate (CER) is inversely associated with mortality in the general and renal transplant population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CER is a marker for muscle mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether the CER is associated with outcome in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether the CER is a determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in diabetic patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe used data from the combined Reduction of End Points in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005978'>Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes</z:hpo> Mellitus with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">Antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> (RENAAL) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5959">Irbesartan</z:chebi> Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>Nephropathy</z:hpo> Trial (IDNT) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,872 patients (58% of the overall population) with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> with valid 24-h urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> excretion data were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of the analyses was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality.RESULTSMean age was 60 Â± 8 years and median CER was 1,407 (total range 400-3,406) mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body surface area, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, black race, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> were positive independent determinants of the CER, whereas female sex and age were inverse independent determinants of the CER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 36 (29-45) months, 300 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a Kaplan-Meier analysis of sex-stratified tertiles of the CER, risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality increased with decreasing CER (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, lower CER (as a continuous variable) was independently associated with increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.39 [95% CI 0.29-0.52], P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for potential collection errors did not materially change these associations.CONCLUSIONSLower CER was strongly associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the CER can be considered a proxy for muscle mass, this puts renewed emphasis on physical condition and exercise in this population </plain></SENT>
