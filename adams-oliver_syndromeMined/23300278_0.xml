<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a multistage meta-analysis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) in Punjabi Sikhs from India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our discovery GWAS in 1,616 individuals (842 case subjects) was followed by in silico replication of the top 513 independent SNPs (P &lt; 10(-3)) in Punjabi Sikhs (n = 2,819; 801 case subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further replicated 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P &lt; 10(-4)) through genotyping in a Punjabi Sikh sample (n = 2,894; 1,711 case subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On combined meta-analysis in Sikh populations (n = 7,329; 3,354 case subjects), we identified a novel locus in association with T2D at 13q12 represented by a directly genotyped intronic SNP (rs9552911, P = 1.82 Ã— 10(-8)) in the SGCG gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, we undertook in silico replication (stage 2b) of the top 513 signals (P &lt; 10(-3)) in 29,157 non-Sikh South Asians (10,971 case subjects) and de novo genotyping of up to 31 top signals (P &lt; 10(-4)) in 10,817 South Asians (5,157 case subjects) (stage 3b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In combined South Asian meta-analysis, we observed six suggestive associations (P &lt; 10(-5) to &lt; 10(-7)), including SNPs at HMG1L1/CTCFL, PLXNA4, SCAP, and chr5p11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of 31 top SNPs in 33,707 East Asians (16,746 case subjects) (stage 3c) and 47,117 Europeans (8,130 case subjects) (stage 3d), and joint meta-analysis of 128,127 individuals (44,358 case subjects) from 27 multiethnic studies, did not reveal any additional loci nor was there any evidence of replication for the new variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide new evidence on the presence of a population-specific signal in relation to T2D, which may provide additional insights into T2D pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
