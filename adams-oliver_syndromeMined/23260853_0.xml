<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Chinese adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, including Chinese men and women aged 45-74 years, free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at baseline (1993-1998) and followed through 2004 for incident physician-diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression models were used to examine the associations between self-reported history of physician-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 5.7 years per person, 2234 of the 42,842 participants included in the current analyses reported diagnoses of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, not including body mass index (BMI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> was associated with a 31% increased risk of incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR=1.31; 95% CI: 1.00-1.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association was attenuated after adjustment for adult BMI (HR=1.25; 95% CI: 0.95-1.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> association appeared stronger for adult- vs. child-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> cases, and for participants who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> compared to non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Singaporean Chinese adults we observed a positive association between self-reported, physician-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> that was modestly attenuated by adjustment for BMI </plain></SENT>
