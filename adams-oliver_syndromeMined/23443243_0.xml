<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While de novo synthesis of fatty acids and triacylglycerol occurs mostly in liver, adipose tissue is the primary site for triacylglycerol storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin signalling mechanisms in adipose tissue that stimulate hydrolysis of circulating triacylglycerol, uptake of the released fatty acids and their conversion to triacylglycerol are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New findings include (1) activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase to stimulate upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1/USF2 heterodimers, enhancing the lipogenic transcription factor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c); (2) stimulation of fatty acid synthase through <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> kinase modulation; (3) mobilisation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplet proteins to promote retention of triacylglycerol; and (4) upregulation of a novel carbohydrate response element binding protein Î² isoform that potently stimulates transcription of lipogenic enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, insulin signalling through mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> to activate transcription and processing of SREBP1c described in liver may apply to adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is associated with increased triacylglycerol synthesis in liver, while it is decreased in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This and other mysteries about insulin signalling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in adipose tissue make this topic especially fertile for future research </plain></SENT>
