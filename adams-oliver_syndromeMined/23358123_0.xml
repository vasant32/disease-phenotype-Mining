<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exenatide once weekly (ExQW), an extended-release formulation of the glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> exenatide, has demonstrated improvements in glycemic and cardiometabolic measures from 30 weeks to 2 years of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the efficacy and safety of treatment with ExQW for 3 years are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were initially randomized to receive either ExQW (2 mg) or exenatide twice daily for 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the initial 30 weeks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were treated with ExQW in an open-label extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses of primary glycemic endpoints, beta-cell function, and cardiometabolic measures were assessed for patients who completed 3 years of ExQW treatment and for the intention-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety and tolerability analyses were provided for the intention-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the intention-to-treat population (n = 295) completed 3 years of treatment (n = 194) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, a significant reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (least squares mean ± standard error) of -1.6% ± 0.08% was observed, with 55% and 33% of patients achieving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) targets of &lt;7% and ≤6.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a sustained reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c), improvements in beta-cell function were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body weight was significantly reduced by -2.3 ± 0.6 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reductions in blood pressure, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adverse events reported most frequently during both controlled and uncontrolled periods included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> of mostly mild intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of these adverse events decreased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Incidence of minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was low and no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ExQW produced clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control that were durable through 3 years of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Significant improvements in cardiometabolic measurements were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>ExQW was well-tolerated during long-term treatment and no new adverse events were noted </plain></SENT>
