<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cutis <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001057'>aplasia cutis congenita</z:hpo>) is a congenital absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> skin layers, often extending through bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This defect usually occurs in the scalp and can be extensive, exposing the dura mater, and deeper meninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment regimens for cutis <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> have included early operative intervention, including skin and bone grafts, local scalp flaps, or free flaps to close the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the significant perioperative risks, these invasive procedures may inhibit the osteogenic potential of the dura to initiate and sustain bony closure of the defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a case of an infant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AOS">Adams-Oliver syndrome</z:e> and cutis <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> involving a large portion of the skull that was treated conservatively with topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9142">Silvadene</z:chebi> dressings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No surgical treatment of bone or soft tissue reconstruction was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case report is the first to our knowledge to document complete bony restoration of the cranial vault through serial three-dimensional CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intensive therapeutic intervention in this case report allowed early discharge from the hospital, a gradual amelioration of the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> as the hair-bearing scalp slowly covered the defect, and precluded the need for any subsequent bony reconstruction of the cranial vault </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that conservative treatment of cutis <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> maintains dural induction of osseous regeneration, and any treatment plan for bony defects of cutis <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> should consider maintenance of dural integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although further investigation is warranted, an initial trial of antimicrobial dressing care might optimally promote secondary closure of the cranial vault without the need for surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
