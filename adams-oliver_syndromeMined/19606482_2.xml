<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AOS">Adams-Oliver syndrome</z:e>, a condition characterized by scalp and limb defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition we noted in our patient a significant delay in the bone age and an abnormal distal phalanx in one of her fingers manifesting clinically as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001500'>broad finger</z:hpo> tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both these features hitherto unreported add to the phenotypic spectrum of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying etiopathogenesis of this condition has remained in the domain of hypothesis, with none being conclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the characteristic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> and our report of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002750'>delayed bone age</z:hpo>, we postulate a role played by the bone morphogenetic protein pathway in the causation of this enigmatic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the background of this postulation and the report of an unusual hand anomaly, a literature review on the various pathogenetic mechanisms and anomalies of the hand reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
