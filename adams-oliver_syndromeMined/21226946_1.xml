<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While several studies have identified the anaerobic threshold (AT) through the responses of blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, ventilation and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> others have suggested the response of the heart rate variability (HRV) as a method to identify the AT in young healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the validity of HRV in estimating the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> threshold (LT) and ventilatory threshold (VT) for individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2D) has not been investigated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyze the possibility of identifying the heart rate variability threshold (HRVT) by considering the responses of parasympathetic indicators during incremental exercise test in type 2 diabetics subjects (T2D) and non diabetics individuals (ND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine T2D (55.6 ± 5.7 years, 83.4 ± 26.6 kg, 30.9 ± 5.2 kg.m2(-1)) and ten ND (50.8 ± 5.1 years, 76.2 ± 14.3 kg, 26.5 ± 3.8 kg.m2(-1)) underwent to an incremental exercise test (IT) on a cycle ergometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate (HR), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and expired gas concentrations were measured at the end of each stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRVT was identified through the responses of root mean square successive difference between adjacent R-R intervals (RMSSD) and standard deviation of instantaneous beat-to-beat R-R interval variability (SD1) by considering the last 60 s of each incremental stage, and were known as HRVT by RMSSD and SD1 (HRVT-RMSSD and HRVT-SD1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were observed within groups for the exercise intensities corresponding to LT, VT, HRVT-RMSSD and HHVT-SD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a strong relationship were verified among the studied parameters both for T2D (r = 0.68 to 0.87) and ND (r = 0.91 to 0.98) and the Bland &amp; Altman technique confirmed the agreement among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HRVT identification by the proposed autonomic indicators (SD1 and RMSSD) were demonstrated to be valid to estimate the LT and VT for both T2D and ND </plain></SENT>
