<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pooled patient-level data from 12 prospective, randomized, controlled studies that used insulin glargine in a treat-to-target titration regimen seeking fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels ≤5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were evaluated by logistic regression models as predictors of reaching a target HbA1c ≤7.0% or experiencing confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of prior glycemic control was further explored by analysis of categorical ranges of baseline HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2312 participants, 95% completed 24 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower HbA1c at baseline was independently associated with reaching HbA1c target (adjusted OR for 1% difference: 0.538, p &lt; 0.0001) and also with likelihood of experiencing confirmed hypoglycemic events (adjusted OR: 0.835, p &lt;0.0001) at week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an unadjusted analysis by baseline HbA1c range, the strong association between baseline control and attaining target HbA1c was confirmed (75% with baseline HbA1c &lt;8.0%, 60% with baseline HbA1c ≥8.0% and &lt;9.0%, and 38% with baseline HbA1c ≥9.0% attained HbA1c ≤7.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> confirmed &lt;3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) was higher in the lower baseline HbA1c ranges but severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was infrequent at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> baseline HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systematically titrated insulin glargine, added to oral agents, was effective over a wide range of baseline HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower baseline HbA1c was the best clinical predictor of achieving HbA1c ≤7.0% and also associated with higher risk of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was infrequent using this treatment approach </plain></SENT>
