<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interventions aimed at lowering weight via changes in diet and lifestyle have repeatedly been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM and even to reverse early disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>Weight gain</z:mp>, a potential side effect of treatment for patients with T2DM, is also an important concern, and it has been noted that weight increases associated with antidiabetes therapy may blunt cardiovascular risk reductions achieved by decreasing blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among older agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> have the lowest risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, meglitinides, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with weight increases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional human insulin formulations are known to increase weight in patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of both pharmacologic and surgical therapies aimed at treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> rather than lowering blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> have the potential to improve glycemic control and even resolve T2DM in some patients </plain></SENT>
