<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, SGLT2 inhibitors have been found to consistently reduce measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, throughout the continuum of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By inducing the renal excretion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and its associated calories, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce weight and have the potential to be disease modifying by addressing the caloric excess that is believed to be one of the root causes of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional benefits, including the possibility for combination with insulin-dependent antihyperglycemic drugs, a low potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, and the ability to reduce blood pressure, were anticipated from the novel mechanism of action and have been demonstrated in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanism-related risks include an increased incidence of urinary tract and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> and the possibility of over-<z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> in volume-sensitive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results of Phase III clinical studies generally point to a positive benefit-risk ratio across the continuum of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date, data on dapagliflozin, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor in development, demonstrate that the kidney is an efficacious and safe target for therapy, and that SGLT2 inhibition may have benefits for patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> beyond glycemic control </plain></SENT>
