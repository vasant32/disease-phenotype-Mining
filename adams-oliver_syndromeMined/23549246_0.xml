<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty two T2DM patients (22 with complications and 30 free of complications) and 52 age/gender-matched healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of β2-GPI-Lp(a) and ox-Lp(a) were measured by "sandwich" ELISAs and their associations with complications were examined using multiple linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum β2-GPI-Lp(a) (1.19±0.30U/mL vs. 0.89±0.20U/mL, p&lt;0.001) and ox-Lp(a) concentrations (13.34±11.73mg/L vs. 5.26±3.34mg/L, p&lt;0.001) were both significantly higher in T2DM than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for β2-GPI-Lp(a) and ox-Lp(a) was 0.725 and 0.738, respectively. β2-GPI-Lp(a) levels were markedly higher in patients with complications than those without complication (1.39±0.28U/mL vs. 1.04±0.31U/mL, p&lt;0.01), whereas no marked difference was found in ox-Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, the association between β2-GPI-Lp(a) and complications remained significant (β=0.249, p&lt;0.05, respectively) after adjustments were made for other traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated β2-GPI-Lp(a) may reflect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> underlying pathophysiological processes involved in development of complications of T2DM </plain></SENT>
