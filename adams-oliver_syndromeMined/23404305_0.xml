<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>End points were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, noncardiovascular mortality, overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> defined by persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We fit a multistate Cox regression model to derive an algorithm for prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predictive accuracy of the calculated 5-year risks was cross-validated.RESULTSSex, age, HbA(1c), years after diagnosis, BMI, systolic blood pressure, non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, current smoker, and leisure-time physical activity were risk factors for macro- and microvascular complications and were incorporated into the risk engine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed-to-predicted (O/P) ratios for each event were between 0.93 and 1.08, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests showed no significant deviations between observed and predicted events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the UK Prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (UKPDS) risk engine overestimated CHD risk (O/P ratios: 0.30 for CHD and 0.72 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C statistics in our Japanese patients were high for CHD, noncardiovascular mortality, and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (0.725, 0.696, and 0.767) but moderate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> (0.636 and 0.614) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By combining macro- and microvascular risks, the classification of low- and high-risk patients was improved by a net reclassification improvement of 5.7% (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONSThe risk engine accurately predicts macro- and microvascular complications and would provide helpful information in risk classification and health economic simulations </plain></SENT>
