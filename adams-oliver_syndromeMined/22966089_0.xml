<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Population-based triethnic cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, aged 40-69 at baseline (1989-1991), and followed-up for 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline measurements included fasting and postglucose bloods, anthropometry, and lifestyle questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified from medical records and participant recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ethnic differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence were examined using competing risks regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incident <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was identified in 196 of 1,354 (14%) Europeans, 282 of 839 (34%) Indian Asians, and 100 of 335 (30%) African Caribbeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Indian Asians and African Caribbeans were first-generation migrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with Europeans, age-adjusted subhazard ratios (SHRs [95% CI]) for men and women, respectively, were 2.88 (95%, 2.36-3.53; P &lt; 0.001) and 1.91 (1.18-3.10; P = 0.008) in Indian Asians, and 2.23 (1.64-3.03; P &lt; 0.001) and 2.51 (1.63-3.87; P &lt; 0.001) in African Caribbeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001956'>truncal obesity</z:hpo> largely attenuated the ethnic minority excess in women (adjusted SHRs: Indian Asians 0.77 [0.49-1.42]; P = 0.3; African Caribbeans 1.48 [0.89-2.45]; P = 0.13), but not in men (adjusted SHRs: Indian Asians 1.98 [1.52-2.58]; P &lt; 0.001 and African Caribbeans, 2.05 [1.46-2.89; P &lt; 0.001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001956'>truncal obesity</z:hpo> account for the twofold excess incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Indian Asian and African Caribbean women, but not men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Explanations for the excess <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk in ethnic minority men remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study requires more precise measures of conventional risk factors and identification of novel risk factors </plain></SENT>
