<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study reconstructed the white matter network of 55 nondemented individuals with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age 71Â±4y) and 50 age-, sex- and education-matched controls using diffusion MRI based fiber tractography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Graph theoretical analysis was then applied to quantify the efficiency of these networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> showed alterations in local and global network properties compared to controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These structural network abnormalities were related to slowing of information processing speed in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This relation was partly independent of cerebrovascular lesion load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the approach of characterizing the brain as a network using diffusion MRI and graph theory can provide new insights into how abnormalities in the white matter affect cognitive function in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
