<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were assigned to treatment with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (increasing by weekly 0.6 mg increments) or placebo for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Appetite ratings were assessed using visual analogue scales during a 5-h meal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Energy and macronutrient intake during the subsequent ad libitum lunch were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 weeks, mean postprandial and minimum hunger ratings were significantly lower with liraglutide 1.8â€‰mg than placebo (p&lt;0.01), and the mean overall appetite score was significantly higher (p=0.05), indicating reduced appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide was associated with higher maximum fullness ratings (p=0.001) and lower minimum ratings of prospective food consumption (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean estimated energy intake was 18% lower for liraglutide than placebo (estimated ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.73;0.94]; p=0.004), but no significant differences in macronutrient distribution were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that reduced appetite and energy intake may contribute to liraglutide-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
