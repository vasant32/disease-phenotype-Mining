<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Targeting glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA(1c)) levels below 7.0% is considered a primary goal of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care, given its importance in obtaining a sustained reduction in microvascular, and possibly macrovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this review was to evaluate the clinical utility of a fixed dose combination of saxagliptin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EVIDENCE REVIEW: The combination of saxagliptin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> was well tolerated and produced sustained glycemic control for up to 76 weeks, with greater improvements in glycemic parameters compared with either drug alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The saxagliptin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combination also proved its non-inferiority compared with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PLACE IN THERAPY: Clinical practice recommends lifestyle interventions together with starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> at the time that the type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> fails to maintain glycemic control, the addition of DPP-4 inhibitors should be the logical choice because of their effects on HbA(1c) compared to the addition of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> or glitazone, and because of their positive effects on beta cell function and their neutral effects on body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DPP-4 inhibitors prevent the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> posed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
