<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevated serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels (SUA) have been associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) and are often reported to be higher in females than in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this report is to determine the prevalence and clinical correlates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> and also to evaluate associations with the MetS in people with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in people with type 2 DM in Lagos, Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>Hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> was defined by cut-off values of &gt; 7 mg/dl for men and &gt; 6 mg/dl for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of MetS was made using the new definition by the American Heart Association and other related bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> and normouricaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis included usage of Student's t test, Pearson correlation coefficients, multivariate regression analysis and chi square </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 601 patients with type 2 DM aged between 34-91 years were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> and the MetS were 25% and 60% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> was comparable in both genders (59% vs 41%, p = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although, the prevalence of the MetS in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> and normouricaemia was comparable (61 vs 56%, p = 0.1), a higher proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740394" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperuricaemic</z:e> subjects had 3 or more components of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Mets</z:e> compared with normouricaemic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Possible predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> include central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking and elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SUA levels were found to be positively and significantly associated with serum TG (r = 0.2, p = 0.0001) and total cholesterol (r = 13, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> in subjects with type 2 DM is comparable in both genders and possible predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> are potentially modifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SUA is positively and significantly associated with serum TG and total cholesterol </plain></SENT>
