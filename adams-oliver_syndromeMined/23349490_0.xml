<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that increased nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signaling contributes to vascular dysfunction in T2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have treated type 2 diabetic (db(-)/db(-)) and control (db(-)/db(+)) mice with two NFκB inhibitors (DHMEQ, 6mg/kg, twice a week and IKK-NBD <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, 500 μg/kg/day) for four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pressure-induced myogenic tone (MT) was significantly potentiated, while endothelium dependent relaxation (EDR) was impaired in small coronary arterioles (CA) and mesenteric resistance artery (MRA) from diabetic mice compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, diabetic mice treated with NFκB inhibitors significantly reduced MT potentiation and improved EDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, vascular function was also rescued in db(-)/db(-p50NFκB-/-) and db(-)/db(-PARP-1-/-) double knockout mice compared to db(-)/db(-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in vitro down regulation of NFκB-p65 using p65NFκB shRNA lentivirus in arteries from db(-)/db(-) mice also improved vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NFκB inhibition did not affect blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels for Sp-1 and eNOS phosphorylation were decreased, while p65NFκB phosphorylation, cleaved PARP-1 and COX-2 expression were increased in arteries from diabetic mice, which were restored after NFκB inhibition and in db(-)/db(-p50NFκB-/-) and db(-)/db(-PARP-1-/-) mice.In the present study, we provided evidence that enhanced NFκB activity impairs vascular function by PARP-1, Sp-1 and COX-2-dependent mechanisms in male type 2 diabetic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, NFκB could be a potential target to overcome <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-induced vascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
