<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether transcription factor 7 like-2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms (rs12255372 and rs7903146), consistently associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, are associated with plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers before and after three weeks of daily treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Men and women in the Genetics of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi>-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network study (n = 1025, age 49 +/- 16 y) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants suspended use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drugs for three weeks and were then given 160 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> for three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory markers and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ANOVA was used to test for differences across TCF7L2 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under the additive or dominant model, there were no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in the concentrations of inflammatory markers (hsCRP, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) across TCF7L2 genotypes in the period before or after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both rs12255372 and rs7903146, homozygote T-allele carriers had significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> concentrations of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the recessive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other significant associations were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall these data show no association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and the inflammatory markers suggesting that the effects of TCF7L2 on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may not be via <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
