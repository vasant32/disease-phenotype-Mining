<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prevalence and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of carotid and cerebrovascular atherosclerotic plaques in T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using multidetector CT (MDCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 64-MDCT and dual-source CT (DSCT) angiographies were performed in 195 T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (mean age 65.7+/-12.8 years; 118 men) between January 2009 to August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the process, plaque type, its distribution, extensive and obstructive natures were determined for each segment derived from the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaques were detected in 183 (93.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 1056 segments with plaque were identified, of which 450 (42.6%) were non-calcified, 192 (18.2%) were mixed and 414 (39.2%) calcified ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, 562 (53.2%) resulted in mild stenosis, 291 (27.6%) moderate stenosis, 170 (16.1%) severe stenosis and 33 (3.1%) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-calcified plaques contributed 91.8% to non-obstructive lumen narrowing, while mixed and calcified plaques contributed 89.0% and 65.0% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MDCT angiography detected a high prevalence of plaques in T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A relatively high proportion of plaques were non-calcified, as well as with non-obstructive stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MDCT angiography might further enhance the detection and management of carotid and cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in T2DM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
