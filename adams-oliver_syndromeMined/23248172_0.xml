<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Giving dual <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> with glucagon and GLP-1 activity to diabetic, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> mice causes enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improves <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance by reduction of food intake and by increase in energy expenditure (EE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to observe the effect of a combination of glucagon and GLP-1 on resting EE and glycemia in healthy human volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a randomized, double-blinded crossover study, 10 overweight or <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> volunteers without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> received placebo infusion, GLP-1 alone, glucagon alone, and GLP-1 plus glucagon simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resting EE-measured using indirect calorimetry-was not affected by GLP-1 infusion but rose significantly with glucagon alone and to a similar degree with glucagon and GLP-1 together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glucagon infusion was accompanied by a rise in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, but addition of GLP-1 to glucagon rapidly reduced this excursion, due to a synergistic insulinotropic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that drugs with glucagon and GLP-1 agonist activity may represent a useful treatment for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies are required to demonstrate that this combination will reduce weight and improve glycemia in patients </plain></SENT>
