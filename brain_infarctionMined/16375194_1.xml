<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of unilateral monoataxia, due to small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the precentral and postcentral gyri, were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 76-year-old man (case 1), and a 90-year-old woman (case 2) suddenly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> of the left upper extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> in the left upper extremity in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But, the other abnormal neurological findings, including the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003808'>abnormal muscle tone</z:hpo>, and proprioceptive deficit, were not noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> disappeared about ten days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> of case 1 remained about two months after the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cases 1 and 2, showed small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at the border between the right precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, brain MRI of case 1 disclosed another <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the just medial portion of the precentral knob and the centrum semiovale of central region, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the central region, was not only due to the interruption of two distinctive neuronal pathways, including the corticopontine tract and cerebellothalamocortical tract, but also due to the disturbance of sensory-motor integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, etiologies of unilateral monoataxia may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, functional outcome may depend on the mechanism of unilateral monoataxia </plain></SENT>
