<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in and around traumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusions</z:mp> are well documented, the role of CBF for the delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of neuronal cells in the traumatic penumbra ultimately resulting in secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> expansion remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate the relationship between changes of CBF and progressive peri-contusional cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF and <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> size were measured in C57Bl6 mice under continuous on-line monitoring of (ETp)<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> before, and at 15 min and 24 h following controlled cortical impact by <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine autoradiography (IAP-AR; n = 5-6 per group) and by Nissl staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contused and ischemic (CBF &lt; 10%) tissue volumes were calculated and compared over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical CBF in not injured mice varied between 69 and 93 mL/100mg/min depending on the anatomical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after trauma, CBF decreased in the whole brain by approximately 50% (39 +/- 18 mL/100mg/min; p &lt; 0.05), except in contused tissue where it fell by more than 90% (3 +/- 2 mL/100mg/min; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 24 h after TBI, CBF recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain areas except the <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> where it remained reduced by more than 90% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>Contusion</z:mp> volume expanded from 24.9 to 35.5 mm3 (p &lt; 0.01) from 15 min to 24 h after trauma (+43%), whereas the area of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (CBF &lt; 10%) showed only a minimal (+13%) and not significant increase (22.3 to 25.1 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The current data therefore suggest that the delayed secondary expansion of a cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> following traumatic brain injury may not be caused by a reduction of CBF alone </plain></SENT>
