<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify possible predictive factors for post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study design was prospective, observational cohort study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological and neuropsychological evaluations were conducted within the first 10 days from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and repeated at the 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria were used to define PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 85 patients with CI, 59 patients completed the 3-month follow-up and 17 of them (28.8 %) fulfilled PSD criteria at the 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Melancholy index of the Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Rankin Scale (HDRS) was associated with a risk three times greater than that of PSD at the 3-month follow-up in the univariate analysis (OR 3.07; 95% CI 1.53-6.16; P = 0.002) with no significant influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity or the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (right or left side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristic curves pointed to a melancholy index &gt; or =1.5 as the optimal cut-off level associated with the development of PSD at the 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Melancholy index of the HDRS &gt; or =1.5 could be a useful clinical tool to detect patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at high risk of developing PSD </plain></SENT>
