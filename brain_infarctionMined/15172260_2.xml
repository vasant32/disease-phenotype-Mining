<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tau is a protein localized primarily in neurons, especially in the axonal compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid tau levels are elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and head traumas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to elucidate the alterations of cerebrospinal fluid tau levels in patients with or without neurologic complication after aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing descending thoracic (n = 8) or thoracoabdominal (n = 20) aortic surgery were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid tau levels were measured before operation and at seven time points up to the 72nd postoperative hour, and were compared with cerebrospinal fluid S100B levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, including the one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients, 20-fold to 100-fold tau elevation was observed, but S100B elevation was less evident in the patient without <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three other patients developed spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional three patients suffered from temporary neurologic dysfunction of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tau levels in the latter three patients showed tenfold elevation and were higher than those in the three patients with spinal cord injury or those in the patients without neurologic complication up to 24 postoperative hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The S100B levels were also higher in the three patients with temporary neurologic dysfunction of the brain than in the patients without neurologic complication at the conclusion of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From 6 to 24 postoperative hours, they were higher in the three patients with spinal cord injury than in the patients without neurologic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that cerebrospinal fluid tau levels reflect brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because tau levels may separate the patients with temporary neurologic dysfunction, they may serve as a useful marker of brain injury </plain></SENT>
