<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, SPECT using a rotating gamma camera was started at 30 minutes after intravenous administration of 111 MBq of I-123 IMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transverse images were reconstructed parallel to the cantho-meatal line and displayed on films </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pontine visualization was visually classified into three grades: high radioactive accumulation confined to the pons with clear contour (Grade 3), faint accumulation with indistinct contour in the pontine region (Grade 1), the pontine accumulation was identified but its activity was less significant (Grade 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that grade of the pontine accumulation was lower in pathological cases compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six cases with brain stem lesion demonstrated pontine accumulation of grade 1 in 4 case and of grade 2 in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower grade was also revealed in 29 cases with crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between classified grade of pontine accumulation and maximum counts of reconstructed images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that SPECT could detect brain stem lesions and that lower accumulation in pons with CCD positive cases was thought to partially reflect the reduced blood flow and metabolism in the pontine nuclei </plain></SENT>
