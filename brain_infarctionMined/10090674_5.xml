<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of cytoplasmic bodies (CBs), the immunohistochemical and biochemical features of muscle samples with nonspecific CBs were compared to those previously described by our group in cytoplasmic body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (CBM), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> in which specific CBs are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we studied nonspecific CBs found in the muscle biopsies of 15 patients with the following diseases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> (n = 3), myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> (n = 1), inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (n = 1), hereditary inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> in a patient with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific inclusions were stained at their periphery by anti-desmin but not by anti-dystrophin antibodies, except in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in which immunostaining was observed with both antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amounts of desmin and phosphorylation pattern (the latter data are available for only four patients) as compared to control specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results differ from those previously reported in CBM, in which CBs were stained by both antidesmin and anti-dystrophin antibodies and in which a hyperphosphorylation of desmin was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>Hypothyroidism</z:hpo> is, thus, the only disease in which nonspecific CBs show the same immunostaining pattern as specific CBs from CBM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that CBs may result from different mechanisms, and that one of these mechanisms may be shared by CBM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
