<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine the magnitude of lesion volume change after standard treatment with tissue plasminogen activator and to determine whether specific volume change thresholds can discriminate clinical responders from nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured lesion volume on diffusion weighted at baseline and on 90-day fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI and scored 3-month modified Rankin Scale in consecutive patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified variables associated with excellent (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 1) and independent (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2) outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 53 patients (mean age 69 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-to-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesion volume increase was 11.7 (+/-7.7) cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 23 patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesion was smaller than the baseline lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 32 patients had an excellent clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dichotomous volume change variables associated with outcome included decrease in volume &gt;or=30% (P=0.004) and volume increase &gt;or=5 cm(3) (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients given standard tissue plasminogen activator therapy, changes in lesion volume are associated with clinical outcome, and threshold lesion volumes can differentiate excellent and poor outcome, suggesting these as a potential marker of outcome </plain></SENT>
