<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects of the present study were patients with ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (14 patients) and with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (21 patients) from the Intensive Care Unit of the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood samples were obtained from the following blood vessels: the common carotid artery carrying blood to the primarily damaged brain hemisphere, both jugular veins carrying blood from the primarily damaged and the contralateral hemispheres, as well as from the cubital vein to obtain specimens of the systemically circulating blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte aggregation was evaluated by using the "Georgian technique" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the RBC aggregation indices increased in both the regional as well as the systemic circulation of the hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study demonstrate different changes of erythrocyte aggregation in ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the role of blood rheological properties in their pathogenesis seems also to be different </plain></SENT>
