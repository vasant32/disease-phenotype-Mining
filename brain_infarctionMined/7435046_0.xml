<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causes of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that roentgenological diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> entailed no difficulties, if the examinations were performed within 24 hours after the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the focus size was over 1 to 2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were some difficulties in diagnosing small foci in the brain stem and in the cortex of brain hemispheres as well as infarctions with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> irrespectively of their size and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> were rather precise in the early stages of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, but extremely difficult later, in a definite stage of the hemorrhagic focus organization when computer-aided tomography revealed densities characteristic for unaffected brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high diagnostic efficiency of the computer-aided tomography was noted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Certain difficulties sometimes arose in determining the character of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> in cases of multiple of small-size foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The morphological verification of the results of the computer-aided brain tomography is of a decisive importance for developing roentgenomorphological criteria for diagnosing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pathologies with the aid of this method, and contributes to further improvement of the latter </plain></SENT>
