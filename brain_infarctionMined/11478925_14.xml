<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Necrotic foci, varying in size and shape, were found in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After immunohistochemical staining for GFAP, GFAP-positive astrocytes in the perinecrotic area known as the ischemic penumbra had distinctly increased in number and size with elongation of cytoplasmic processes 3 days after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic observation revealed that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> granules had markedly accumulated in the cytoplasm of astrocytes located in the ischemic penumbra 3 and 5 days after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days after infarction, however, the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> granules disappeared from the astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intermediate filaments increasingly appeared in the protoplasmic astrocytes after 3 days and were abundant in the activated and hypertrophied astrocytes after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result of our present study, we conclude that: (1) the function of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake from blood vessels was not impaired in the astrocytes under hypoxic conditions; (2) the astrocytes actively ingested blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> through the endothelial cells and accumulated it as <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> for activation of their functions, and the cell volume increased under hypoxic conditions; (3) the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of energy metabolism and the decrease in the uptake of energy sources in the nerve cells promoted <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> accumulation in the astrocytes under hypoxic conditions; (4) intermediate filaments (GFAP filaments) increased in number, coincident with the activation and enlargement of the astrocytes; and (5) protoplasmic astrocytes were transformed into fibrous astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
