<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Mean platelet volume (MPV) has been associated with the prognosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its spontaneous variability during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the disease is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods - One hundred and thirty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, aged 75.4+/-11.0 (SD) years, were classified according to several criteria: National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, maximum lesion diameter on CT scan, Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Projects (OCSP) and Trial of ORG 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet parameters were determined 1.2 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, and after 3.0 further days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial MPV was higher in non-lacunar than lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (8.30+/-1.10 vs. 7.95+/-0.79 fl, P=0.04), and correlated with the sampling delay with respect to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, especially in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with lesions &gt;=4 cm (r=0.39, P=0.009), NIHSS &gt;=11 (r=0.35, P=0.02) and of cardioembolic origin (r=0.35, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently a late MPV increment was observed in the remaining categories: from 8.20 to 8.38 fl (P=0.02) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with lesions &lt;4 cm, from 8.11 to 8.31 fl (P=0.01) in the presence of an NIHSS&lt;11 and from 8.20 to 8.61 fl (P=0.03) when the occlusion of a large artery was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Platelet volume is not stable during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase in non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, as it increases early in the most severe forms, and later in the remaining subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The release of large and more reactive platelets may contribute to the thrombophilic state associated with ischemic events </plain></SENT>
