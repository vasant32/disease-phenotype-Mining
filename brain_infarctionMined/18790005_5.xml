<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic time window and mechanism of tetramethylpyrazine on transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats and 20mg/kg tetramethylpyrazine was injected intraperitoneally at different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit scores and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volumes were measured 72 h after reperfusion started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> reductase were examined at 6h and at 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results included the findings of a significant reduction in neurological deficit scores and infarction volume in the treatment group as compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury resulted in a decrease in the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>, while tetramethylpyrazine administration greatly elevated the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-2 mRNA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> reductase-1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> reductase-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that administration of tetramethylpyrazine, within a 4h time period post-transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, may reduce cerebral ischemic reperfusion damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of tetramethylpyrazine may be mediated, in part, by an increase in genetic transcription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
