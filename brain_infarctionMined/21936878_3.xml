<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we have shown that by increasing the brain-to-blood <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> efflux upon scavenging blood <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> with either oxaloacetate or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, one achieves highly significant neuroprotection particularly in the context of traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study examines, for the first time, how the blood <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> scavenging properties of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> transaminase (GPT), alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, may contribute to the spectrum of its neuroprotective mechanisms and improve the outcome of rats exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, as they do after head trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats that were exposed to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and treated with intravenous 250 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> had a smaller volume of infarction and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, resulting in an improved neurological outcome and reduced mortality compared to control rats treated with saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> at the low dose of 31.3 mg/kg did not demonstrate any neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when combined with 0.6 mg/kg of GPT there was a similar neuroprotection observed as seen with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> at 250 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with 1.69 g/kg <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> had a worse neurological outcome and a larger extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in mortality, infarcted brain volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, as well as the improved neurological outcome following MCAO, was correlated with a decrease in blood <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that the blood <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> scavenging activity of GPT and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> contributes to the spectrum of their neuroprotective mechanisms and may serve as a new neuroprotective strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
