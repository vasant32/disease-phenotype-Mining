<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare sensitivity and specificity of admission nonenhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans with those of CT angiographic source images in detection of early ischemic changes in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to retrospectively compare admission nonenhanced CT scans with CT angiographic source images in delineation of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> extent, with follow-up images as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent and institutional review board approval were received for this HIPAA-compliant study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonenhanced scans and angiographic source images obtained within 12 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 51 patients suspected of having <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two blinded neuroimagers rated presence and extent of hypoattenuation on nonenhanced scans and angiographic source images with Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Level of certainty for hypoattenuation detection was assigned a grade with a five-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, nonenhanced scans and angiographic source images were compared for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> delineation, linear regression coefficients determined correlations of ASPECTS for nonenhanced scans and angiographic source images with ASPECTS for follow-up images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regressions were used to compare these correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up nonenhanced CT scans, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images, or fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained (mean time to follow-up, 5.4 days); 33 patients had infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With level of certainty cutoff score of 4 or greater (probable, definite) for ischemic hypoattenuation, sensitivity for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 48% (nonenhanced scans) and 70% (angiographic source images) (P = .04, ROC analysis); specificity was 100% for both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Linear regression revealed R(2) = 0.42 (P &lt; .001) for correlation between delineation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on nonenhanced scans and on follow-up images evaluated with ASPECTS and 0.73 (P &lt; .001) for correlation between delineation on angiographic source images and follow-up images evaluated with ASPECTS (P &lt; .001, nonenhanced scans vs angiographic source images) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CT angiographic source images, compared with nonenhanced CT scans, are more sensitive in detection of early irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and more accurate for prediction of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
