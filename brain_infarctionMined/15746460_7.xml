<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A number of clinical syndromes describing the presentation of deep brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are called lacunar syndromes resulting from small vessel occlusion (SVO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To verify the reliability of the clinical diagnosis "lacunar syndrome," the value was investigated with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 73 patients (mean age 66 years; range 35 to 83 years) with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a classical lacunar syndrome were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the DWI findings, patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1, single subcortical lesion (&lt;15-mm lesion; 43 patients; 59%); group 2, large (&gt; or =15 mm) or scattered lesions in 1 vascular territory (16 patients; 22%); and group 3, multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories (14 patients; 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism other than SVO could be identified in 17 (23%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac work-up revealed a cardiac embolic source in 8 patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duplex sonography revealed symptomatic stenosis in 9 patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the work-up information, 29 patients (40%) were found to have a potential cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> other than SVO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation with &gt;1 single lesion on DWI-MRI and a clinical proven embolic source was observed (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients with MRI suspicious for a pathomechanism other than SVO, no embolic source was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of DWI-MRI improves the accuracy of the subtype diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inaccuracy has to be expected in approximately one third if lacunar diagnosis is based on clinical and computed tomography findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most of these "false-positive" cases are attributable to large artery or cardiogenic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
