<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 166 patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> with symptoms of TACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients (38.0%) with good outcome [G group, the modified Rankin Disability Scale (mRS) after 3 months &lt; or =3] and 103 patients (62.0%) with bad outcome (B group, mRS &gt;3) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On univariate analysis, G group patients were significantly younger, had lower score in the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) of total and consciousness sub-score, had lower rate of clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On cranial CT at entry, three early CT signs [hyperdense middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) sign, hypodensity of &gt;1/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34342">3 MCA</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>] were significantly more frequent in the B group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the second CT at 24-48 h, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area as assessed by the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was significantly smaller in the G group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis with logistic regression revealed age &lt;7 0 years, NIHSS &lt; or =15, no clinical deterioration, and only no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> in early CT signs, and ASPECTS &gt; or =7 as independent predictors of good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some clinical variables are useful in predicting outcome in TACI within the early period after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
