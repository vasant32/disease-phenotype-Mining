<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to delineate preoperative factors that may predict perforator injuries following open surgery for an unruptured middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 85 consecutive patients who underwent surgical clipping of 91 unruptured <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to demographic profiles, angiographic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which included the side, size, projection, height from the origin of the ophthalmic artery, and distance between the internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> origin, were analysed and correlated with perforator injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with the preoperative CT and/or MRI, any newly-developed infarctions in the striatocapsular area were regarded as perforator injuries even if they were very small and asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A perforator injury was found in 14 out of 91 cases (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of them remained asymptomatic, neurological deterioration occurred in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the analysed variables, both the height (from the origin of the ophthalmic artery) and the distance (between the ICA bifurcation and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> origin) were significantly associated with perforator injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A stepwise increment of the risk was observed as the position of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> became higher or as the distance to the ICA bifurcation became shorter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results would be helpful in estimating surgical risks for an unruptured <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, one of the most commonly encountered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the neurosurgical field </plain></SENT>
