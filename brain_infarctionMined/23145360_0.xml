<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unstable atherosclerotic plaques are prone to rupture followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, vessel stenosis, and occlusion and frequently lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As such, unstable plaques represent an important diagnostic target in clinical settings and the specific diagnosis of unstable plaques would enable preventive treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, various imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) have been widely used clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these methods have advantages in terms of spatial resolution and the ability to make detailed identification of morphological alterations such as calcifications and vessel stenosis, these techniques require skill or expertise to discriminate plaque instability, which is essential for early diagnosis and treatment and can present difficulties for quantitative estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, nuclear imaging techniques such as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) can noninvasively collect quantitative information on the expression levels of functional molecules and metabolic activities in vivo and thus provide functional diagnoses of unstable plaques with high sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, unstable plaques are characterized by an abundance of invasive inflammatory cells (macrophages), increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> that increases oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and its receptor expressed on cells in the lesions, increased occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of macrophages and other cells involved in disease progression, increased protease expression and activity, and finally <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation triggered by plaque rupture, which is the most important mechanism leading to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of infarctions and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these characteristics can <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> be targets for molecular imaging by PET and SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review the present state and future of radiolabelled probes that have been developed for detecting atherosclerotic unstable plaques with nuclear imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
