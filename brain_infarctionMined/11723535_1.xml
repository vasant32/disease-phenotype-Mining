<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients included in these trials were highly selected, as were the surgeons performing the operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical practice is different but the same results should be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study indications, technique, early and late results, and whether carotid endarterectomy has been performed in accordance with standards defined by multicentric trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case report study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary care private hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 57 patients, on whom 70 carotid endarterectomies were performed over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age was 66.4 +/- 7.8 years; 43 (75.4%) were male, 41 (71.9%) hypertensive, 36 (63.1%) current smokers and 24 (21.0%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was present in 31 (54.3%) patients, peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> in 32 (56.1%) and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> in 25 (43.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had had angiography and 41 (71.9%) had also had a duplex-scan of neck arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral imaging via computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging was obtained for 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up over a period of one to 122 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASUREMENTS: early and late post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, early and late post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and recurrence of atheroma plaque and symptoms relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1.4%) caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and two early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.8%): a total complication rate of 4.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After 3 and 5 years, 95.4% and 81.3% of patients respectively were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free and 72.8% and 67.3% were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were four recurrences and two of them related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (70%) stenoses operated on were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was detected in 59.2% of patients who underwent computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy was done in accordance with international standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The most frequent cause of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and recurrences were related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Patients should be followed up closely </plain></SENT>
