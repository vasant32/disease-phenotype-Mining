<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that a brief <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> episodes can render brain resistant to a subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations indicate that mechanisms of such stimulated endogenous neuroprotection are related to the family of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factors (HIF), however there are still little data available on the role of HIF family members in hippocampus-a brain structure, highly sensitive to oxygen deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used the model of cultured hippocampal slices and single-cell quantitative RT-PCR to study HIF-1α and HIF-3α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression following triple 5-min mild <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp>, 30-min oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and their combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also tested the effects of HIF <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi>-hydroxylase inhibition with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44737">2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid</z:chebi> diethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> pre-treatment followed by a 30-min oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that neuronal damage induced by oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation was accompanied by a significant decrease in both HIF-1α and HIF-3α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in CA1 but not CA3 neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>Anoxia</z:mp> preconditioning did not affect cell viability and HIF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels but applied before oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation prevented neuronal damage and suppression of HIF-1α and HIF-3α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was also found that effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi>-hydroxylase inhibitor were similar to <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> preconditioning increases anti-ischemic neuronal resistance which to a certain extent correlates with the changes of HIF-1α and HIF-3α expression </plain></SENT>
