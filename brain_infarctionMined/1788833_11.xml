<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in 21 male patients, aged from 51 to 65 years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of severe hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> diagnosed clinically and radiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The examinations showed that circadian variations of platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic activity were persistent, but the intervals and the degree of oscillation differed from those in healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significance of these disorders for clinical purposes was discussed </plain></SENT>
