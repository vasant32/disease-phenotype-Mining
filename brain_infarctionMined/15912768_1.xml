<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is little known, however, that paroxysmal, devastating, and potentially fatal complications can occur when the early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are subtle and missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical course and neuropathological findings of the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> during two atypical clinical courses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one patient, it was due to Serratia marcescens detected only by an autopsy specimen, and in the other, it was due to Aspergillus detected by a surgical biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> followed multiple, extensive, and progressively multiplicative infarctions in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebral cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsies revealed that the infarctions were caused by severe inflammatory change in the vascular walls, mainly of the arteries of the skull base, including the basilar and carotid arteries </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of characteristic Aspergillus hyphae were recognized in the arterial wall of one patient </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and initiation of vigorous therapy should be stressed for therapeutic success </plain></SENT>
