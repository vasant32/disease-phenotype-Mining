<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old healthy woman presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> of the right eye immediately after a Valsalva maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination, in particular visual acuity, vigilance and ocular movements, was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, ECG and angio-CT of the neck and head vessels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but MRI/DWI and T2 sequences showed recent bi-thalamic ischemic lesions in the paramedian territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler sonography and transesophageal echocardiography showed a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> due to an atrial communication, with septum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hours cardiac monitoring was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but prior to an eventual closure of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath> she underwent an ambulatory 7-day ECG monitoring which revealed several paroxystic short lasting passages into <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, unnoticed by the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interest in this case is threefold: (1) bilateral paramedian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> which usually presents with a devastating clinical picture may occur clinically silent; (2) monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> which is usually associated with ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> may be the consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is never completely ruled out, here it was caught only in a 7-days ambulatory R-test, and consequently prevented closure of a possibly asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
