<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 58 hospitalized newborns with purulent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> receiving MRI examination from January 2005 to February 2012 were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathogens and MRI findings were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 58 newborns, 44 (76%) showed complications of the neural system on the first MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Escherichia coli were found as the most common pathogen in newborns with <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> bacteria-induced purulent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (six cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the six cases, four presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302598" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventriculitis</z:e>, one with subdural effusion and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Listeria monocytogenes was frequently seen in newborns with <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>Gram-positive</z:mp> bacteria-induced purulent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cases presented with different degrees of white matter damage on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal purulent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> caused by different pathogenic bacteria has different image characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that understanding the patterns of MRI findings is useful in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of neonatal purulent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> caused by different pathogens </plain></SENT>
