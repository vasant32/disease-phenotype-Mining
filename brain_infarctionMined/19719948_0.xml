<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We further determined the optimal temperature of local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight adult male Sprague Dawley rats (260 - 300 g) were randomly divided into 3 groups: group A, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion without cold saline infusion (n = 26) (control group); group B, infusion with 20 degrees C saline before reperfusion (n = 26); group C: infusion with 10 degrees C saline before reperfusion (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each group, we chose 15 rats for monitoring physical indexes and the temperature of the brain (cortex and striatum) and body (anus), measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volume, assessment of neurological deficits and the survival rate of reperfusion at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another 8 rats from each group was chosen for examining <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, another 3 from each group for histological observation by electron microscopy (EM) and light microscopy (LM) at 48 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference among the 3 groups for physical indexes during the examination (F((2, 45)) = 0.577, P = 0.568; F((2, 45)) = 0.42, P = 0.78 for blood pressure and blood gas analysis, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain temperature was significantly reduced in the group C compared to the other groups (F((2, 45)) = 37.074, P = 0.000; F((2, 45)) = 32.983, P = 0.000, for cortex and striatum temperature respectively), while the difference in rectal temperature between group A and B or C after reperfusion was not significant (F((2, 45)) = 0.17115, P = 0.637) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in group C (from 40% +/- 10% in group A, 26% +/- 8% in group B, to 12% +/- 6% in group C, F((2, 45)) = 43.465, P = 0.000) with the neurological deficits improving in group C (chi(2) = 27.626, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival rate at 48 hours after 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C saline reperfusion was increased by 132.5% and 150%, respectively, as compared to the control group (chi(2) = 10.489, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> showed no significant difference (F((2, 21)) = 0.547, P = 0.587) after cold saline infusion compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No obvious vascular injury was found by electron or light microscopy in either infusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with 10 degrees C cold saline infusion can significantly decrease the infarction volume, improve the neurological deficits, and 10 degrees C seems to be the optimal temperature in inducing a cerebral protection effect during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This procedure could be adopted as a further treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
