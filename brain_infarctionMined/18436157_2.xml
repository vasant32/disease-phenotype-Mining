<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no proven therapeutic effect for drugs other than thrombolytic ones in treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some recent studies indicate that neuroprotective compounds such as citicoline can be of benefit in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo>, including the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out to assess the efficiency of citicoline in increasing muscular strength of patients with nontraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a double-blind randomized clinical trial on 32 patients with hemorrhagic nontraumatic supratentorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, who were divided into two groups of 16, the first of which was treated with citicoline (250 mg intravenously twice a day) for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second group was given placebo and their muscular strength was measured through physical examination before treatment and then 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The groups were matched in terms of age, sex, and amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The muscular strength of the two groups was compared using Mann-Whitney nonparametric test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Half of the patients were male and the mean of muscular strength in both groups before intervention was 2.5 (0-4.5) and after intervention was 4 in the group receiving citicoline and 3.12 and in the group receiving placebo, which indicates a meaningful difference (P = .019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that muscular strength in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> receiving citicoline increased and indicated that citicoline may be efficient in treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
