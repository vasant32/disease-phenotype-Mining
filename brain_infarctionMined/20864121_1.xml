<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether incidental CA influences <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and clinical outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (BH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, frequency and neuroradiological profile of incidental CA were compared between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and asymptomatic healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included consecutive BI and BH patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging and MRA within 7 days from clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CA diagnosis was performed by 3-dimensional time-of-flight MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics, risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidental CA was detected in 18 (3.7%) of 481 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, 13 (3.5%) of 374 BI patients, 5 (4.7%) of 107 BH patients, and 146 (2.0%) of 7345 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed no significant differences in CA frequency between BI, BH, and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female sex was associated independently with incidental CA in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01), BI (P&lt;0.05), BH (P&lt;0.05), and healthy control groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistical differences in CA size and location between the 4 groups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BI subtypes and BH sites were not correlated with incidental CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CA rupture or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> did not occur until 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 3-month mRS score did not differ between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with and without CA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 3-month mRS score was not affected by incidental CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Female sex was only an independent factor for incidental CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thus, we should pay more attention to incidental CA in female BI patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
