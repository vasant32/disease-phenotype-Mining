<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with a history of exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23012,30252">CS2</z:chebi> were divided into two equal groups according to their level of exposure, and they completed a questionnaire and were evaluated for neuropsychological symptoms using the Korean version of the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one MRI images were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in total, verbal and performance IQs between high- and low-exposure groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI findings revealed a significantly larger number of cerebral lacunae (five of 12 subjects) in the high-exposure group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Periventricular hyperintensities were mostly located in frontal and occipital areas, and white-matter hyperintensities were mostly in frontal and parietal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of lacunae in the high-exposure group as revealed by MRI suggests that further MRI studies are needed into long-term neuropsychological effects induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30252">CS2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
