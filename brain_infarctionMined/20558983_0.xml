<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: No prior study has reported on the cortical activation pattern in hemiparetic patients with a pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the cortical activation pattern of hemiparetic patients with a pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, using functional MRI scanning (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Fifteen consecutive patients who showed severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> due to a pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The motor function was assessed at the time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and fMRI scanning was performed (on average 8.9 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fMRI was performed during a motor task of timed hand grasp-release movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the fMRI, the laterality index was calculated to assess the relative activity in the ipsilateral versus the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except for 2 (bilateral SM1 activation) showed contralateral SM1 activation without ipsilateral SM1 activation associated with the affected hand movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average laterality index for the affected hand movements among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 0.97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The fMRI results showed that primarily the contralateral SM1 was activated during affected hand movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it appears that the motor function of the affected hand, in patients with a pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, recovers mainly via the lateral corticospinal tract </plain></SENT>
