<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is a recognized risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) along with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Any uncertainty remains about other putative risk factors, ultrasound-derived, such as carotid soft plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was carried out concerning cases of IS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) found in an outpatient population from February 2000 to March 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For every patient with documented IS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 1 to 2 controls without previous cerebrovascular event were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variables analyzed were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, defined as mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (140-160 mm Hg) or moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (&gt;160 mm Hg); age, divided into 3 classes: 60 to 70, 70 to 80, and 80 to 90 years; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and carotid plaques, categorized as "soft" or "hard" plaques, and as plaques achieving mild (&lt;50%) or moderate (50%-70%) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourty-six cases and 60 controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age between 80 and 90 years, carotid soft plaques and 50% to 70% stenoses predicted ischemic cerebral events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, only moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR]: 15.536; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.142-58.271; P = 0.0000) and oldest age class (OR: 15.862; 95% CI: 3.836-65.592; P = 0.0001) proved to predict IS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Soft plaques were found to predict risk of IS (OR: 13.50; 95% CI: 2.9788-61.1821) in hypertensive, but not in patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had been controlled by therapy (OR: 0.2308; 95% CI: 0.0270-1.9720) (qualitative interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and very old age predicted IS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, whereas carotid soft plaques did not, in the presence of normotensive blood pressure </plain></SENT>
