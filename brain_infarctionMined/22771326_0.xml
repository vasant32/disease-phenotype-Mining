<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to an intense emphasis on neuroprotection, relatively few studies have addressed means of vascular protection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we discovered that the ligand to immidazolin receptor, 2-BFI, not only provided potent neuroprotection during middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rat, which confirmed our previous reports, but also protected the integrity of the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 2-BFI twice daily after the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 14 d significantly improved the neurological deficits, reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and importantly, protected the cerebral vasculature as evidenced by the increased expression of an endothelial marker, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, and better preservation of the cerebral vasculature, as viewed under a confocal microscope on rat brain perfused with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that 2-BFI contributes to protection of neurovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular mechanisms could eventually lead to development of more effective therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
