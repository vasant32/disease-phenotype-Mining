<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Positive family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of familial aggregation of a certain disease is better evaluated by the genetic relative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is calculated by dividing the prevalence of specific disease in family members of patients by the prevalence of this disease in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, who were subtyped clinically and radiologically, we determined the genetic relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By questionnaire and additional interview, we obtained a complete first-degree family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in first-degree relatives of these lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was compared to the self-reported prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a Dutch community based cohort of elderly volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the influence of proband characteristics and family composition on parental and sibling history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected data of 1066 first-degree relatives of 195 lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> occurred in 13.5% of first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genetic relative risk was 2.94 (95%CI 2.45-3.53) for overall first-degree relatives, 4.52 (95%CI 3.61-5.65) for patients' parents and 2.10 (95%CI 1.63-2.69) for patients' siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age of proband and proband status for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> influenced the chance of having a parent with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> whereas the likelihood of having a concordant sibling increased with sibship size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased genetic relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in first-degree relatives of patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data warrant further genomic research in this well-defined high risk population for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
