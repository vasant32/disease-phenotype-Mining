<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between subcortical ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (SIVD) and cognition in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly is unclear, in part because of methodological inconsistencies across studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify this relationship, the current study investigated a well characterized cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly sample (&gt;or=55 years) with quantitative MRI and psychometrically robust neuropsychological measures within a multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Converging evidence suggests that SIVD selectively impairs frontal-executive tasks by disrupting frontal-subcortical circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that MRI markers of SIVD would be selectively associated with worse executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 94 participants who were cognitively and functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Volumetric measures of white matter signal hyperintensity (WMH), subcortical lacunes, hippocampal volume, and cortical gray matter were obtained to predict performance on composite measures of executive functioning and episodic memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hierarchical regression demonstrated that after controlling for demographic variables, MMSE, and total intracranial volume, the total number of subcortical lacunes was the only significant predictor, with a greater number of lacunes associated with poorer executive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal volume best predicted episodic memory performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that SIVD in the form of silent lacunes corresponds to poorer executive functioning even in otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly, which is consistent with the hypothesis that SIVD preferentially disrupts frontal-subcortical circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical importance of these findings is highlighted by the fact that 33% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly participants in this study had lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
