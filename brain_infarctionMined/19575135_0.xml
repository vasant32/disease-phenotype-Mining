<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports describe a significant rate of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thalamic and midbrain blood supply can arise from complex anatomical variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rare variation: "artery of Percheron", is a solitary arterial trunk arising from one of the proximal segments of a posterior cerebral artery and supplies the paramedian thalami and rostral midbrain bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient that underwent elective endovascular treatment for a basilar tip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> using GDC and stents in each <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>; 12 hours later patient was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> and not following commands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed bilateral paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> presumably secondary to artery of Percheron occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic event related to the use of the GDC embolization and stents is a rare clinical sequelae, but catastrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of antiplatelets agents should be reinforced in the scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When bilateral medial thalamic and midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are found, occlusion of the artery of Percheron should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography may not b helpful and lack of visualization of the artery does not exclude its presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case the MRI findings confirmed the presence of the infarction based on the anatomical distribution </plain></SENT>
