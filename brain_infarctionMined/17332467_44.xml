<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), is a major factor driving <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> into the brain parenchyma in a variety of neuropathologic conditions associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, recent studies indicate that CCL2 and its receptor (CCR2) could have an important role in regulating blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the role of the CCL2/CCR2 axis in regulating postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown, and vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CCR2(-/-) and CCR2(+/+) mice were subjected to focal transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation were observed at days 1 and 5 of reperfusion by evaluating the product surface area for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-albumin and measuring water and electrolyte contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to assess <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cDNA gene and protein arrays for inflammatory cytokines were used to assess inflammatory profiles in CCR2(+/+) and CCR2(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CCR2(-/-) mice had reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes and significantly reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation in the affected ischemic hemisphere compared with CCR2(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This reduction in injury was closely associated with reduced infiltration of not only monocytes but also neutrophils (7- and 4-fold decreases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, CCR2(-/-) mice had reduced expression/production of inflammatory cytokines during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that inhibiting the CCL2/CCR2 axis affects brain reperfusion outcome by reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp>, and inflammatory mediator expression </plain></SENT>
