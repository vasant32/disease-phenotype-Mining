<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 14 patients with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> were divided into a control group and a treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment group was exposed to low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for 2 weeks, twice a day, for 15 min per session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stimuli were delivered at 0.5 Hz to the left posterior parietal cortex (i.e. position P3 according to 10-20 electroencephalogram co-ordinate systems) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients performed a battery of tasks, including line bisection and line cancellation tests, 2 weeks before treatment, at the beginning, at the end, and 2 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, the performance of the patients in the treatment group improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The behaviour assessment data changed with time; at time-points 2 and 3 the comparison test showed a significant difference in line cancellation and line bisection results (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study indicates that low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the unimpaired hemisphere might improve visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and points to the need for further studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results support the theory of inter-hemispheric competition in the attentional network </plain></SENT>
