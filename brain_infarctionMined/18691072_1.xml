<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study Hp polymorphism in a sample of 124 patients with a rather homogeneous type of cerebrovascular disease, namely first symptomatic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to small vessel disease, in comparison with a large (n=918) control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hp phenotypes were determined using <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hp1 allele frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls (0.480 vs. 0.395, p&lt;0.05), mainly due to a lower Hp2-2 phenotype frequency (25.0 vs. 36.3 %; OR 0.59; 95%CI 0.38-0.90; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was even more pronounced in younger (&lt;or=60 years) patients (Hp1 allele frequency 0.539) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant asymptomatic lacunar lesions were present in 82 patients, extensive white matter lesions in 47 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between Hp1 and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> suggests that Hp may serve different functions depending on the pathological processes in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in different organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between Hp1 and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may relate to blood-brain barrier dysfunction, to the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cerebral small vessel disease, or a special dependence of small vessel wall integrity on Hp2-2 related angiogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of concomitant signs of cerebral small vessel disease weakened the association between Hp1 and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which could reflect a difference in underlying vascular pathophysiology in which Hp phenotype may play a different role </plain></SENT>
