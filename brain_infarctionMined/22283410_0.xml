<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine in cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elderly adults whether vascular factors predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and whether these associations are mediated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of subclinical vascular brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective multisite longitudinal study of subcortical ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Memory and aging centers in California </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-four participants who were cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at entry and underwent at least two neuropsychological evaluations and two MRI examinations over an average follow-up of 6.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Item response theory was used to create composite scores of global, verbal memory, and executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Volumetric MRI measures included white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBIs), hippocampus, and cortical gray matter (CGM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the associations between vascular factors, MRI measures, and cognitive scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) was associated with greater declines in global cognition, verbal memory, and executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CAD associations remained after controlling for changes in WMHs, SBIs, and hippocampal and CGM volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: History of CAD may be a surrogate marker for clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which also affects the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Structural MRI measures of WMHs and SBIs do not fully capture the potential adverse effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> on the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future longitudinal studies of cognition should incorporate direct measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in cerebral arteries, as well as more sensitive neuroimaging measures </plain></SENT>
