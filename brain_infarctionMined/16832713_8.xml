<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been observed that a cytokine synthesis inhibitor, pentoxifylline, prevents the apoptotic processes taking place in the amygdala following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown if the cardioprotective effect of A(2A) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, CGS21680, which reduces cytokine synthesis, would lead to such amygdala <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study was designed to investigate whether cardioprotective A(2A) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor activation reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the amygdala following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized rats were subjected to left anterior descending coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 40 min, followed by 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The A(2A) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> CGS21680 (0.2 mug/kg/min i.v.) was administered continuously for 120 min, starting (1) five minutes prior to instituting reperfusion (Early) or (2) five minutes after the beginning of reperfusion (Late) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined and the amygdala was dissected from the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was reduced significantly in the Early compared to the Control group (34.6 +/- 1.8% and 52.3 +/- 2.8% respectively; p &lt; 0.05), with no difference compared to the Late group (40.1 +/- 6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> regression was documented in the amygdala of the Early group by an enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway activation and Bcl-2 expression concurrently to a caspase-3 activation limitation and reduction in TUNEL-positive cells staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, amygdala TUNEL-positive cell numbers were not reduced in the Late group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, TNFalpha was significantly reduced in the amygdala of the Early group compared to the Control and Late groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that A(2A) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor stimulation is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> regression in the amygdala following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
