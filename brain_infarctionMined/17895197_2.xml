<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of symptomatic BAS patients who were evaluated by our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were followed-up for a median of 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) specific for posterior circulation involvement were common (12/19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), were often multiple, and frequently preceded a posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proximal (13/28) and mid (10/28) basilar arteries were the most common sites of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> most often affected the pons, but also frequently involved the cerebellum and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant vertebral artery disease was prevalent (12/18 patients who underwent conventional cerebral angiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms included artery to artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, basilar branch disease, and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same-territory recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 8.2% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients in the series were treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients suffered a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while on a therapeutic dose of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (international normalized ratio [INR], 2.0 to 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was performed in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The same-territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was 8.2% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> (INR, 2.0 to 3.0) appeared to be effective in preventing recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty of the basilar artery was technically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic BAS typically affected the proximal and mid-basilar artery and most often caused infarction in the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> frequently preceded a posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
