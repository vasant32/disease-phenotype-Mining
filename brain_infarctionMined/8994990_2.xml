<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of this operation as published so far include data on the learning curve of the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy when performed by a large number of surgeons during the year 1994, not taking into account the beginning years in which the technique was being used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study has been carried out prospectively and anonymously among members of SFCERO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients who underwent a cholecystectomy started laparoscopically during 1994 have been included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some 4,624 cholecystectomies were performed by 150 surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 3,310 females (42.5 +/- 19.8 years old) and 1,314 males (56.3 +/- 1.61 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conversion rate was 6.9%: 320 operations had to be converted into laparotomy (group II) while 4,261 were performed entirely by laparoscopy (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morbidity was 5% (N = 230)-4.7% in group I (N = 203) and 8.4% in group II (N = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 0.2% (N = 9)--namely four intraabdominal complications (three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> and one biliary re-operation), two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failures</z:hpo>, and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were not specified in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that morbidity and mortality have not changed dramatically since the beginnings of this technique, whereas the frequency of common bile duct (CBD) injuries has decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the conversion rate has increased slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results make it possible to calculate the risk of conversion and postoperative complication according to the age of the patient and the biliary symptoms </plain></SENT>
