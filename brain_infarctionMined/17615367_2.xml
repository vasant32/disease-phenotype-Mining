<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among patients presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), some clinical features predispose to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, whereas others predispose to subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the implication of negative diffusion-weighted imaging on a baseline MRI in predicting subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied patients presenting in the emergency department within 12 hours of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (motor or speech) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a MRI within 24 hours of the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> within 1 year of study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 85 patients had a MRI, among which 35 patients (41.2%) had a diffusion-weighted imaging lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to MRI was 12.1 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients without a diffusion-weighted imaging lesion on baseline MRI were 4.6 times (27.4% versus 5.9%; P&lt;0.05) more likely to have a subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> at 1 year than patients with a diffusion-weighted imaging lesion, but 4.3 times (2.1% versus 9.1%; P=0.19) less likely to have a subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a diffusion-weighted imaging lesion on the baseline scan predicts recurrent transient events rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
