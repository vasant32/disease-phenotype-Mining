<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> can be difficult, since evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is habitually lacking on CT and conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on neuroimaging should be considered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases instead of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, regardless of duration of symptoms, implying that optimal diagnostic methods need to be utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore postulated that perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (PW imaging) would be useful in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 22 patients with reversible neurologic symptoms lasting less than 24 hours, assessed with DW and PW imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was abnormal in 15 patients (68%): 12 had abnormal DW imaging, four had both DW and PW imaging defects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with a mismatch) and three had an isolated PW imaging abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in symptom duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> between patients with abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and those with unremarkable scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with mismatch were more likely to need conventional angiography or other cerebrovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combined use of DW imaging and PW imaging provided evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in most patients with clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies using follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging are required to determine the outcome of affected tissue, as well as the clinical implications of DW-PW imaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
