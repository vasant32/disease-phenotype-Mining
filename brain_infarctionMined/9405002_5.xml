<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the prognostic significance of early infarction signs in CCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated clinical and CCT findings of 95 consecutive patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the territory of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 55 patients CCT was performed within 3 h, and in 40 cases between 3 and 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the clinical findings were assessed by the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disability due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was evaluated after 4 weeks by use of the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could demonstrate the following early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>: focal hypodensity (23.2%), obscuration of basal ganglia (12.6%), focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> (22.1%), hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCA; 11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> led to ventricular compression, in 1 patient to midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of early infarction signs did not depend on the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but was significantly associated with a severe neurological deficit at admission and an unfavourable disability status 4 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and HMCA were often followed by extensive infarction lesions on the follow-up CCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, early signs of hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> visible on CCT scans performed within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are correlated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and an unfavourable functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, a substantial part of our patients had a benign course of the disease in spite of early CCT pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decisions on therapy in individual patients therefore should not depend on early CCT findings exclusively </plain></SENT>
