<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan findings suggested cerebral arterial infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriography revealed occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, unilaterally in the first and bilaterally in the second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> could be followed on serial CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No predisposing factors during pregnancy or delivery were found, and serious neurologic deficits developed in both children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases demonstrate that, even in full-term neonates with discrete or moderate neurologic symptoms and born after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy and delivery, the possibility of vasoocclusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is suggested by imaging techniques, of which CT scanning seems to have the greatest value at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique also permits the follow-up of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for neurologic development appears to be variable: minor neurologic deficits as well as unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011099'>spastic hemiplegia</z:hpo> in older children may be the consequence of inapparent cerebral arterial infarction in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
