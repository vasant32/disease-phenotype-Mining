<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Associations among microbleeds, white matter lesions (WMLs), and small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on imaging have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because many of these imaging <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were asymptomatic, the relationship of microbleeds to clinical lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An association between microbleeds and clinically defined lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might suggest a common causal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with lacunar, partial anterior circulation or posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes and older healthy subjects underwent MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microhemorrhages, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and WMLs were coded blind to clinical details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A final clinicoradiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype diagnosis was assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 308 subjects (67 older healthy and 241 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), 54 patients had microbleeds (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microbleeds were twice as frequent in lacunar than cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (26% versus 13%, P=0.03) or healthy older subjects (9%) and associated with increasing WML scores (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lacunar and cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and healthy older subjects had similar WML scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microbleeds are associated with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> defined clinicoradiologically more than other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes but not simply by association with WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that microbleeds and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have a similar microvascular abnormality </plain></SENT>
