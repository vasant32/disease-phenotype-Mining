<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Place cells in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus are known to be responsible for the formation of global place maps, while CA3 neurons respond to changes in local contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is proposed here that when dorsal CA1 is selectively destroyed, gerbils will be unable to solve direction and place problems while context-dependent representations of relative maze positions should be spared since CA3 cells are left intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty female Mongolian gerbils were subjected to 5 min of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and, along with 20 controls, were subsequently tested on a response, direction or one of two types of open field place problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Locomotion in a circular open field was recorded as a measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gerbils with damage restricted to dorsal CA1 were <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> compared to controls, but were not impaired on place, direction, or response tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because gerbils solved these tasks in the absence of dorsal CA1, maze tasks which have traditionally been labeled "place" or "direction" tasks may actually be testing the animal's ability to discriminate between two relative contexts, without the need for a global place map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings support recent reports that different hippocampal subfields control different aspects of spatial learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the context-dependent representations in CA3 appear to support the learning of the "place" and, likely, "direction" solutions in current and previous open field and T-maze tasks </plain></SENT>
