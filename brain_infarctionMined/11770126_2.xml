<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> has been a subject of numerous experimental studies employing different models and focusing on the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was the evaluation of our own model of focatcerebral damage caused by a photodynamic reaction, and determination of its utility as a model of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and blood-brain barrier damage in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were used for the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were anaesthetised with 3% chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> (325 mg/kg) and injected intravenously with 40 mg/kg of 3% solution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After removal of the periostium the brain was irradiated through the skull for 30 min with a 250 W <z:chebi fb="62" ids="24473">halogen</z:chebi>, air-cooled light source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The material for morphologic studies was sampled 24 h, 4 days and 7 days after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brains were fixed by perfusion, embedded in paraffin, and stained with haematoxilin-eosin (HE), acid <z:chebi fb="11" ids="27698,35170">vanadium</z:chebi> fuchsin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>, and GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results document the usefulness of this method for studying focal brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed morphological changes and disturbances in blood-brain barrier provided information about the dynamics of the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, the formation of necrotic foci, and the quality and extent of brain damage in the surrounding tissue </plain></SENT>
