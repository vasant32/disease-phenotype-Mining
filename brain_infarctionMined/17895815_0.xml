<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She required intubation hours after admission and was not able to communicate for 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon recovering consciousness, she reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001141'>severely impaired vision</z:hpo> in both eyes, but ophthalmologic evaluation and neuroimaging were not obtained until several days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmologic examination documented <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and profound binocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0456909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vision loss</z:e> with hourglass bilateral homonymous hemianopic visual field loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI showed signal abnormalities restricted to the area of the lateral geniculate bodies (LGBs) with characteristics most suggestive of hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Very few cases of isolated bilateral LBG lesions have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Damage has been attributed to myelinolysis from osmotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> or to infarction from microvascular occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case conforms more to microvascular infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vulnerability of the LGB to selective microvascular infarction may be based on a combination of its unique architecture and high metabolic demand </plain></SENT>
