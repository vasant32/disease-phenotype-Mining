<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections, patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> visible on CT were categorized according to a pathogenetically oriented classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This differentiated ischemic brain damage due to low flow from thromboembolic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, cerebral hemodynamic reserve was evaluated by means of both <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>-dependent vasomotor reactivity and HMPAO- and 99mTc-RBC-SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six out of 11 patients with ischemic infarctions had the territorial type of brain lesion, suggesting distal embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients revealed the pattern of hemodynamically induced low-flow infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral hemodynamic reserve was significantly decreased only in these latter patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ICA dissections the frequencies of hemodynamically and thromboembolically induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> is approximately equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that only half of the patients with symptoms of symptomatic dissections had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain emboli</z:e>, whereas in the other half the dissections lead to a low-flow effect in terminal supply areas which is so severe that non-embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This differentiation can help decide whether antithrombotic or hemodynamic treatment should be given </plain></SENT>
