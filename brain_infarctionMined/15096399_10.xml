<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with LS and SDIs between those with vs without a parent arterial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Analysis of data from a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Using clinical syndrome, diffusion-weighted imaging, and vascular studies, we divided 173 patients into 3 groups: (1) parent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> occluding deep perforators (PAD), LS with SDIs, and a parent arterial lesion (n = 32); (2) small artery disease (SAD) (n = 70); and (3) large artery disease (LAD) (n = 71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and the prognosis were registered for 1 year, and the outcome of the PAD group was compared with that of the SAD and LAD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, there were 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (6 vascular) and 18 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate in the PAD group (16%) was significantly higher than that in the SAD group (1%) (P =.01) but similar to that in the LAD group (17%) (P =.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of the parent arterial lesion was the only independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with LS and SDIs (odds ratio, 13.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-123.9; P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although LS on examination, SDIs on diffusion-weighted imaging, and a stable hospital course suggest lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of benign course, our results indicate that the PAD group represents an intracranial type of LAD </plain></SENT>
