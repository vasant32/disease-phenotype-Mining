<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE.: Acoustic peak rarefaction pressure (APRP) is the main factor that influences ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether recanalization rate and functional outcomes in the Transcranial Ultrasound in Clinical SONothrombolysis (TUCSON) trial could be predicted by estimated in vivo APRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS.: We developed an acoustic attenuation model to estimate the in vivo APRP at the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> site in each subject of the TUCSON trial with CT scans eligible for measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables included temporal bone thickness, depth of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> site, and average attenuation of skin and brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was defined as partial or complete using the Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Infarction</z:e> flow grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional independence was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS, 0-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: APRP was calculated in 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with sonothrombolysis (mean age, 64 ± 15 years, 65% men; median NIHSS score, 13; IQR, 6-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean APRP was 30.2 ± 15.5 kPa (range, 8-68 kPa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with persisting occlusion had nonsignificantly lower APRP than patients with partial or complete recanalization (25.2 ± 8.0 versus 32.3 ± 17.7 kPa; p = 0.228) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who were functionally independent at 3 months had nonsignificantly higher APRP than patients with worse outcome (35.1 ± 19.5 versus 25.9 ± 11.2 kPa; p = 0.217) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS.: Our exploratory analysis suggests a potentially important role of successful energy delivery to augment thrombolysis with 2-MHz ultrasound in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
