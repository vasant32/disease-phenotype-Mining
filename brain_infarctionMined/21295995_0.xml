<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 639 patients with BI were enrolled in this study, with 314 subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> registered as age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>eGFR was calculated according to the equation 194 × Cr(-1.094) × Age(-0.287) (-0.739 if female), where Cr is serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentration, and was classified into four stages: stage I, eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2); stage II, eGFR 60 ~ 89 mL/min/1.73 m(2); stage III, eGFR 30 ~ 59 mL/min/1.73 m(2); and stage IV, eGFR &lt;29 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage III-IV was significantly more prevalent in the BI group (38%) than in the control group (22%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for stage III-IV was significantly higher in the BI group (1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the BI subgroups, the odds ratios of stage III-IV for the atherothrombotic type (1.81; 95% CI, 1.23-2.68) and the cardiogenic type (2.25; 95% CI, 1.32-3.83) were significantly higher than that of the control group, but that of stage III-IV for lacunar type was not (1.67; 95% CI, 0.98-2.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
