<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The basal ganglia (BG) contain several functional compartments and multiple, parallel segregated circuits processing different cortical information through cortical-BG-thalamus-cortical loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three zones of corticostriatal input are present: sensorimotor, associative and limbic, which correspond to poor, intermediate and strong calbindin (CB) labelling, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other functional compartments, such as striosomes, extrastriosomal matrix and matrisomes, also convey segregated projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microvascular territories in the human BG are spatially consistent with little overlap and few anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high percentage of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occur in the BG, yet the relationship between lacunae and functional compartments is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We determined the relationship between microvascular territories and functional compartments within the human striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microvascular territories were labelled by co-injection of diffusible dye, radio-opaque substance and gelatin into parental vessels and by sectioning each BG co-planar with the Talairach system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sections underwent immunocytochemistry or histochemistry and the overlap of microvascular and functional territories was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CB staining of the arterial-injected striatum matched the functional compartments reported previously and overlay of microvascular territories revealed a correspondence between (i) the lateral lenticulostriate arteries (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e>) and sensorimotor zone; (ii) the medial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSA</z:e> and associative zone; and (iii) the recurrent artery of Heubner (RAH) and limbic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A greater number of large vessels and capillaries were found in the matrix compared to striosomes, and a likely correspondence exists between high-density arteriole envelopes and matrisomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The higher number of non-anastomotic vessels and capillary beds within the matrix predisposes these regions to both large lesions and small lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, creating specific symptoms based on striatal circuitry </plain></SENT>
