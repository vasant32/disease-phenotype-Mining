<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a model of infarction produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, aFGF-positive staining that was not seen in controls appeared in both neurons and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive neurons were distributed mainly in the periventricular region of the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuronal aFGF began to be detectable about 24 h after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The staining intensity for such neuronal aFGF increased until about 14 days after the surgery, but decreased gradually and was undetectable after more than 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive macrophages first appeared on the 3rd day after the occlusion and were persistently seen up to the 7th day, but were no longer visible after 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that aFGF may be involved in the repair processes following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
