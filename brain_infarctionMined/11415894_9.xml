<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical significance of microembolic signals (MESs) detected by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess the findings of diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) and other clinical characteristics in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and MESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed TCD and DWI within 48 hours and 7 days, respectively, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the number of MESs and DWI findings, risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients had MESs detected by TCD (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> group) and 18 had no MESs (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and smoking; NIHSS score; blood-coagulation parameters; and interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and DWI study did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> was more frequent in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small, multifocal ischemic lesions (&lt;10 mm in diameter) on DWI were more frequent in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conventional CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging often failed to show these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small, often asymptomatic DWI abnormalities were more frequent in patients with MESs detected by TCD and with large-vessel occlusive diseases than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without MESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCD and DWI may provide early clues to the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
