<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the control group of 29 subjects without any obvious disease of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, the concentration of beta-2-microglobulin was 1.15 +/- 0.37 mg/1 (M +/- s.d.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentration was almost significantly elevated in the groups with fresh brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean ratio between CSF and serum beta-2-microglobulin was 0.79 +/- 0.32 in the control group and more than 1.0 in the patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011450'>CNS infections</z:hpo> and spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
