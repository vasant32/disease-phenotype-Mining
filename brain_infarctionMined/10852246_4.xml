<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a novel 11-mer retro-inverso peptidomimetic, Prosaptide D5, was injected i.m. to assess its effectiveness in a rat ischemic model produced by reversible total occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prosaptide (300 microg/kg, i.m.) injected 3 h after reversible occlusion reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area by 56% compared with a saline group (p &lt; 0.01) at 21 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar injection of D5 6h after occlusion produced a 32% decrease </plain></SENT>
