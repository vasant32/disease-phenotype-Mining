<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the anterior choroidal artery territory accompanied homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 59-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> felt <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in his left upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our hospital with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> on his left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He noticed a small black spot in the left inferior portion of his visual field; however, this disappeared within one minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He had no <z:mp ids='MP_0002090'>visual defects</z:mp> as assessed by a confrontation test, but a Goldmann visual field test revealed that there were homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotomas</z:hpo> in the left inferior portion of the visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighted images in the territory of the right anterior choroidal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anterior choroidal artery penetrates the lateral geniculate nucleus from the front, and branches of the artery usually supply the medial and lateral parts of the lateral geniculate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of these branches causes the loss of the upper and lower homonymous sectors in the visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present case exhibited homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We assumed that our patient's homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotomas</z:hpo> were a variant form of wedge-shaped visual field deficits often seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior choroidal artery syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis the experience gained in this case, we consider that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the anterior choroidal artery territory should undergo ophthalmological examination, even when no <z:mp ids='MP_0002090'>visual defects</z:mp> are detected by a confrontation test </plain></SENT>
