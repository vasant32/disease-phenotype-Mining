<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the spatiotemporal profile of structural alterations in (peri)lesional tissue in relation to post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery of neuronal function remains largely to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed neurological testing in combination with in vivo serial T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess functional recovery in relation to longitudinal changes in tissue integrity from 3 h up to 9 weeks after experimental unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, to evaluate perilesional neuronal connectivity, we conducted <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>-enhanced MRI after MnCl(2) injection in cortical tissue at the boundary of the lesion at 10 weeks post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals showed significant improvement of neurological function over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Normalization of tissue T(2) and fractional diffusion anisotropy (FA) after significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> change was observed in cortical and subcortical lesion borderzones between 3 and 9 weeks post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progressive FA increase above baseline levels was detected in perilesional white matter areas (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these animals particularly, significant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> enhancement appeared within the neuronal network around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesion, including areas that were part of the lesion at day 3 post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This longitudinal multi-parametric MRI study suggests that resolution of early ischemic damage and reorganization of white matter in perilesional tissue is chronically accompanied by preservation or restoration of neuronal connectivity, which may significantly contribute to post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> functional recovery </plain></SENT>
