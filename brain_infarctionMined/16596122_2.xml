<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effective E-selectin dose range required to achieve mucosal tolerance and the precise mechanisms of neuroprotection remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the mechanisms of cytoprotection using gene expression profiling of tissues in the setting of mucosal tolerance and inflammatory challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), we achieved immune tolerance with 0.1 to 5 microg E-selectin per nasal instillation and observed a dose-related anti-E-selectin immunoglobulin G antibody production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show the distinct patterns of gene expression changes in the brain and spleen with the different tolerizing doses and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prominent differences were seen with such genes as insulin-like growth factors in the brain and downregulation of those encoding the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, mucosal tolerance to E-selectin and subsequent exposure to LPS resulted in significant tissue changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes, while giving an insight to the underlying mechanisms, serve as possible targets for future studies to facilitate translation to human clinical trials </plain></SENT>
