<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>Cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> are rare but are the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is based on our clinical experience with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxomas</z:hpo> over a period of 11 years at Sejong General Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We focused on the embolic complications of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 59 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo> who were treated between January 2000 and March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> were divided into two types: type 1, with an irregular or villous surface and a soft consistency, and type 2, with a smooth surface and a compact consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 59 investigated patients were classified into the embolic group and the non-embolic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiac obstructive symptoms, embolic events and constitutional symptoms were observed in 37 (62.7%), 13 (22.0%) and 10 (16.9%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the embolic and non-embolic groups were compared, there were no significant differences in vascular risk factors, the ejection fraction, the left atrial diameter or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> were significantly more frequent in the embolic group (p = 0.009 by Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression analysis showed that type 1 pathology alone was independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp>-related embolism (p = 0.008; odds ratio 10.056; 95% confidence interval 1.828-55.337) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in any of the 59 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 13 patients with embolism, 11 (84.6%) had brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main patterns of the lesions were multiple lesions (8 out of 11 patients, 72.7%) and lesions in the middle cerebral artery territories (7 out of 11 patients, 63.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The other 2 patients were found to have occlusion of the left central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery and left external iliac artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additionally, incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were found in the latter case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp>-related symptoms in the 53 patients receiving outpatient management during the follow-up period (range 2 months to 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The embolic potential of <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp> was associated with an irregular surface pathology but not with vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography should be performed in patients with embolic events, especially when cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with multiple territorial lesions are detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection is a relatively safe and curative procedure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011672'>cardiac myxoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
