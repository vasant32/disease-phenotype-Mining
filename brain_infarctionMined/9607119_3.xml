<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by assessing diffuse intima-media thickness measurements and localized plaque using B-mode ultrasonography, and we measured the concentrations of plasma fibrinogen, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 as markers for platelet activation, and the activity of plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor as a marker for endothelial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intima-media thickness was significantly associated with age, male sex, the concentrations of plasma beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4, and the activity of plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plaque score showed a significant association with male sex, the concentration of fibrinogen, and the activity of plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results may indicate that underlying mechanisms are not the same between the intima-media thickness and plaque formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that hemostatic markers could reflect the severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with cerebral small artery disease, and that preventive antiplatelet therapies against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> might be necessary for patients with severe carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
