<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have been reported to exhibit anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many studies revealed that drugs with potent anti-inflammatory potential can protect animals against <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo>, e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this current work we established an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> injury by inducing cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (CI/R) in rats to elucidate whether silymarin or silibinin can protect animals from CI/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with silymarin, but not silibinin, dose-dependently (1-10μg/kg, i.v.) reduced CI/R-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by 16-40% and improved neurological deficits in rats with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated pathophysiological biomarkers for CI/R-induced brain injury, including <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reduced by silymarin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated proteins (e.g., inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and myeloperoxidase), and transcriptional factors (e.g., nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1), as well as production of proinflammatory cytokine (e.g., interleukin-1β and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α) was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly prevented by silymarin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an in vitro study on microglial BV2 cells showed that silymarin could inhibit nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> production, possibly by interfering with NF-κB nuclear translocation/activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, silymarin pretreatment also inhibited IκB-α degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation in brain tissues of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal that silymarin, but not its active component silibinin, protected rats against CI/R-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury by amelioration of the oxidative and nitrosative stresses and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-mediated tissue injury through impeding the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB and STAT-1) in the upregulation of proinflammatory proteins and cytokines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-damaged sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, silymarin displays beneficial effects of preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative disease</z:hpo>, e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which needs further investigation and clinical evidences </plain></SENT>
