<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hand shaping and posture preceding grasping was not appropriate, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> of the hand was not corrected by visual guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fiber-tracking of the sensorimotor tract on diffusion tensor MRI and electrophysiological studies revealed that the lesion involved the area 1, 2, 5, and 7 of the cortices in Brodmann's nomenclature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the most cases with limbkinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> caused by posterior lesion in the center region, hand <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> in manipulation should be corrected by visual guidance, which did not function in this case due to coexisting disturbances of kinesthesia with relatively large lesion in the parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
