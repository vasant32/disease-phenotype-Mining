<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies showed that cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a cytokine in the interleukin-6 family, protected the developing rat brain against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (FCI) in vivo and prevented cortical neuron <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which CT-1 prevents neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are not clearly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This in vivo study focused on whether CT-1 treatment prevented FCI-induced brain injuries in the postnatal day 7 (P7) rat through modulating activation of the initiator caspase-8 (C-8) and the downstream effector caspase-3 (C-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FCI caused a significant increase in expressions of cleaved C-8 and C-3 and, meanwhile, a significant decrease in expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) in the left ischemic cortex of the P7 rat brain after FCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exogenous treatment of CT-1 significantly reduced the expression of cleaved C-8 or C-3 and attenuated the decline in MAP2 expression in the ischemic cortex from 12 to 24 hr after FCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent in vitro experiments demonstrated that CT-1 treatment inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (SNP)-induced activation of C-8 and C-3 and loss of MAP2-positive neurons in cortical neuron cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, CT-1 activated several pathways, including Janus kinase 2, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, nuclear factor kappa B, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPK kinase in the cultures exposed to SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first suggestion that CT-1 prevents neuronal injury in the developing central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system possibly through mediating multiple signal pathways, inhibiting activation of C-8 and C-3 </plain></SENT>
