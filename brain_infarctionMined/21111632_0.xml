<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) is a well-known strong risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although few studies have examined silent cerebral ischemic lesions in patients with NVAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SCIs) and cerebral white matter lesions and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in NVAF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects included 71 consecutive patients with NVAF and 71 sex-and age-matched controls with sinus rhythm who had undergone MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Number, size, and localization of SCIs and severity of periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensity (DSWMH) on magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk factors and CHADS2 score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of SCIs was significantly larger and the rates of SCIs in the cortex/subcortex and deep white matter were higher in the NVAF group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DSWMH grade was also significantly higher in the NVAF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NVAF was an independent risk factor for SCIs and DSWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of cortical and subcortical SCIs was significantly correlated with CHADS2 score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cortical/subcortical and deep white matter SCIs were more frequent and DSWMH grades were higher in NVAF patients compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CHADS2 score was an effective scheme not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk but also in risk of SCI </plain></SENT>
