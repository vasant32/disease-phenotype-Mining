<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth/vascular permeability factor (VEGF) is a candidate for an angiogenic and hyperpermeability inducing factor in an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> because it is a secretable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> specific for endothelial cells and is upregulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study attempts to clarify the chronological expression of VEGF and its receptor (flt) system in experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With the use of a reproducible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats, VEGF expression was identified by Western blotting with anti-VEGF antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chronological expression of the VEGF/flt system was analyzed semiquantitatively by immunohistochemical means in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with different time courses from 3 hours to 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGF and flt were expressed exclusively in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bands obtained on the immunoblot at 38 and 45 kD are related to those of VEGF121 and VEGF165 isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macrophages, neurons, and glial cells chronologically expressed VEGF immunoreactivity in a different fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both VEGF (bound) and flt were detected in endothelial cells along with the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the ischemic brain the macrophages, neurons, and glial cells appear to contain VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The VEGF receptor flt was induced in endothelial cells along with the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The VEGF/flt system is thus considered to be involved in the healing process of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
