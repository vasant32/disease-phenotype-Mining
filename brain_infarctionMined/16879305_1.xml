<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found SIRDs in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and followed them with serial EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SIRDs appeared between 4 and 13 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of illness and persisted for 2-3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discharges were elicited by tactile or nociceptive stimuli and lasted for 20-120 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were detected in 2/6, 1/3 and 2/11 EEGs performed between 9 and 32, 2 and 4 and 3 and 15 days, respectively, after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> varied: blunt triphasic waves, rhythmic delta activity and rhythmic sharp wave complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The background EEG activity was slowed or suppressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disseminated <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp> (ADEM) with good recovery and the other two had fatal hypoxic ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIRDs appear to be a transient phenomena occurring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, appearing hours to few days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of SIRDs in ADEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serial EEGs and repeated testing of EEG response to tactile and nociceptive stimuli is required for their detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Larger number of patients with SIRDs need to be studied to assess their prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
