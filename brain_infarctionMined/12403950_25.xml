<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the proportion and clinical characteristics of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> who harbor infarction(s) on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using T(2)-weighted imaging (T(2)-WI), fast fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and DWI, we studied 57 consecutive patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal neurologic symptoms lasting less than 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A hyperintense DWI lesion was identified in a vascular territory appropriate to the symptoms in 27 patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions judged to be clinically appropriate on T(2)-WI and FLAIR overlapped with a DWI lesion in 41 and 48% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of infarction on DWI were previous nonstereotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, presentation with motor symptoms, and identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DWI establishes that recent infarction occurs in almost half of patients with the clinical syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and this subgroup is more likely to harbor an underlying cardiac or cerebrovascular abnormality </plain></SENT>
