<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We and others have reported that rapid ischemic postconditioning, interrupting early reperfusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reduces infarction in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its extremely short therapeutic time windows, from a few seconds to minutes after reperfusion, may hinder its clinical translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this study we explored if delayed postconditioning, which is conducted a few hours after reperfusion, offers protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was generated by 30 min occlusion of bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) combined with permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>); delayed postconditioning was performed by repetitive, brief occlusion and release of the bilateral CCAs, or of the ipsilateral CCA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, delayed postconditioning performed at 3h and 6h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> robustly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, with the strongest protection achieved by delayed postconditioning with 6 cycles of 15 min occlusion/15 min release of the ipsilateral CCA executed from 6h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that this delayed postconditioning provided long-term protection for up to two months by reducing infarction and improving outcomes of the behavioral tests; it also attenuated reduction in 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (FDG)-uptake therefore improving metabolism, and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and blood brain barrier leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients is usually achieved by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) application, however, t-PA's side effect may worsen ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested whether delayed postconditioning counteracts the exacerbating effect of t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that delayed postconditioning mitigated the worsening effect of t-PA on infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delayed postconditioning reduced ischemic injury after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which opens a new research avenue for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy and its underlying protective mechanisms </plain></SENT>
