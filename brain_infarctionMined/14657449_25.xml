<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the risks associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e> for increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and neurodegenerative changes are well established, the effects on the brain of low to moderate alcohol intake are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subclinical cerebral abnormalities identified on MRI have been associated with neurocognitive decline and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations of alcohol intake with MRI-defined cerebral abnormalities in a middle-aged, population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 1993-1994, a total of 1909 middle-aged adults (40% men and 49% blacks) from 2 communities in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (Forsyth County, North Carolina, and Jackson, Miss) underwent a cerebral MRI examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trained neuroradiologists coded the images for the presence of infarction and the extent (10-point scale) of white matter lesions, ventricular size, and sulcal size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In logistic regression analyses, there was no association between alcohol intake and the presence of MRI infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In linear regression analyses, alcohol intake was not associated with white matter grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, intake of each additional alcoholic drink per week was associated with a 0.01 grade greater ventricular size (P=0.03) and a 0.009 grade greater sulcal size (P=0.02) after adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, income, sports index, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive associations of alcohol intake with ventricular and sulcal size were consistent across sex and race subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A protective effect of low to moderate alcohol intake on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was not found; moreover, increased alcohol intake was associated with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
