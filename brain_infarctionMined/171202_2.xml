<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computerized axial tomography is a new method of tissue examination with x-rays whereby a picture can be produced which is a representation of a slice of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is done by irradiating the skull from 180 or 225 incremental angles and measuring the absorption at each of these angles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then with the aid of a computer a tomogram is produced which can be displayed on a screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These tomograms are representations of a cross-section of the skull composed of 160 X 160 points showing the various intracranial structures with great detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates the diagnostic possibilities of the high definition matrix with reference to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disorders</z:e> in a large sample of patients for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> are shown as areas of decreased absorption compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Others, however, have been found to have higher absorption values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastomas</z:hpo> very contrasting pictures are produced with coexistng areas of decreased, increased and similar values to brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important finding is the visualization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> which appears as a low density area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A grading system of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedemas</z:hpo> is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> has been found to propagate mainly in the white matter producing finger-like shapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Out of 209 intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> 203 were recognized in the plain scan, a further five after contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients who have suffered from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the differentiation between haemorrhage and infarction is made simple due to the contrasting appearance between the two types of lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Location, size and propagation direction of a haematoma as well as rupture of a haemorrhage into the ventricular system can be defined exactly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> the hypoxically damaged tissue is well delineated and readily attributable to a given vascular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In head injuries, for the first time it is possible to differentiate brain <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> from intracerebral haematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Coup and contre-coup are demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial haematomas may be diagnosed easily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>With <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematomas</z:hpo> the new method fails if the contents of the haematoma shows the same absorption values as brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Late sequelae of head trauma such as <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> defects and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of tissue after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> can be seen in the tomogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, subdural effusions and malformations of the brain, computerized axial tomography offers a complete diagnosis so that other invasive, neuroradiological investigations may be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Orbital tumors</z:e> are picked out with great clarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The high definition matrix allows the demonstration of the optic nerve, the lense and the suspension of the eyeball </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Without doubt in the coming years computerized axial tomography will play a dominant role in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
