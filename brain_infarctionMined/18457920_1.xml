<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> induces the immediate early genes (IEGs) rapidly and transiently that may initiate a cascade of cellular responses that are necessary for survival and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> on ischemic/hypoxic neuronal cells was only partly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> on oxygen- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-deprivation (OGD) and OGD followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) on the expression of IEGs were examined in PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result showed that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the media was reduced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The temporal response of IEG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 was induced with different degree of intensity following <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, whereas the level of GAPDH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was relatively constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these signals of c-fos, c-jun, and nur77 by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> were reduced significantly by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with OGD also activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The induction of c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> (0.1 microM) and MAPK inhibitors (10 microM of U0126, D98059, SB203580) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> increased the expression of ERK1/2 by OGD concomitantly diminished the LDH release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the present studies demonstrated that OGD induced IEGs including c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 and MAPK signaling pathways were regulated differently by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
