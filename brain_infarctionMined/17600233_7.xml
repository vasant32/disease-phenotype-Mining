<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It remains unclear whether C-reactive protein (CRP) is a serum marker for atherothrombotic disease or a causal factor in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the association between CRP gene variations and cerebral small-vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) in the Rotterdam Scan Study (N=1035) and the MEMO Study (N=268) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Common haplotypes within the CRP gene were determined by genotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then their relation with periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions and the prevalence of lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was explored by regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no association between CRP haplotypes and measures of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> in either study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no effect modification of the association between serum CRP levels and measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> by CRP haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that CRP is not causally involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
