<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors used phase-contrast MRI in 40 NOTCH3 mutation carriers (mean age 45 +/- 10 years) and 22 nonmutated family members (mean age 39 +/- 12 years), to assess baseline total cerebral blood flow (TCBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline TCBF was significantly decreased in NOTCH3 mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In young subjects, baseline TCBF was significantly lower than in nonmutation carriers (mean difference 124 mL/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, baseline TCBF did not differ significantly between mutation carriers with minimal and mutation carriers with moderate or severe white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in mean cerebrovascular reactivity was found between mutation carriers and nonmutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that a decrease in baseline TCBF in NOTCH3 mutation carriers precedes the development of white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
