<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the neuroprotective action of a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb 761) in permanent and transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion models in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-four animals were given either EGb 761 (50-200 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally, 1 hr before permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, to evaluate the dose-response effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional 58 animals received EGb 761 (200 mg/kg) or vehicle, 0.5- 4 hr after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, for establishing the therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment was also employed in 110 animals treated with either EGb 761 (100-200 mg/kg) or vehicle at 2-3 hr following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion for 2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral scores were determined 22-24 hr after permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and either 3 or 7 days after transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volumes were measured upon sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local cortical blood flow (LCBF) was serially measured in a subset of animals receiving EGb 761 (100-200 mg/kg) or vehicle, 0.5 hr and 2 hr after permanent and transient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to vehicle-treated controls, rats pretreated with EGb761 (100 and 200 mg/kg) had significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, by 36% and 49%, respectively, and improved sensory behavior (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment with EGb 761 also significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, by 20-29% and 31%, when given up to 2 and 3 hr following transient and permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, respectively, whereas improved neurobehavioral scores were noted up to 2 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LCBF was significantly improved in the ipsilateral cortex following the EGb 761 treatment, whereas a higher dose showed a more sustained effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, EGb 761 protected against transient and permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and was effective after a prolonged reperfusion period even when therapy is delayed up to 2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotection may be at least partially attributed to the beneficial effects of selectively improved LCBF in the area at risk of infarction </plain></SENT>
