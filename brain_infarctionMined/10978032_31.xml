<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comparison of incidence and case-fatality rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in different countries may increase our understanding of the etiology of the disease, its natural history, and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the context of an aging population and the trend for governments to set targets to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, prospective comparison of such data across countries may identify what drives the variation in risk and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registers, using multiple sources of notification, ascertained cases of first in a lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between 1995 and 1997 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study populations were in Erlangen, Germany; Dijon, France; and London, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude incidence rates were age-standardized to the European population for comparative purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case-fatality rates up to 1 year after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were obtained, and logistic regression adjusting for age group, sex, and pathological subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was used to compare survival in the 3 communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2074 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were registered over the 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-standardized rate to the European population was 100.4 (95% CI 91.7 to 109.1) per 100 000 in Dijon, 123.9 (95% CI 115.6 to 132.2) in London, and 136.4 (95% CI 124.9 to 147.9) in Erlangen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both crude and adjusted rates were lowest in Dijon, France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate ratio, with Dijon as the baseline comparison (1), was 1.21 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.34) in London and 1.37 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.54) in Erlangen (P:&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the proportion of the subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between populations, with London having lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P:&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Case-fatality rates varied significantly between centers at 1 year, after adjustment for age, sex, and subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (35% overall, 34% Erlangen, 41% London, and 27% Dijon; P:&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is considerable, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> varies significantly between populations in Europe as does the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The striking differences in survival require clarification but lend weight to the evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management may differ between northern and central Europe and influence outcome </plain></SENT>
