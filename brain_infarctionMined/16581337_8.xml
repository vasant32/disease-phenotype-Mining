<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To place these in context, one can express both the risk of side effects and the benefits for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in terms of events per person-year of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mortality risk from fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> is approximately 0.3 per 100,000 person-years, and the risks of nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> and of putative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-attributable <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> are approximately 3 and 12 events, respectively, per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use is to avert several hundred <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and several hundred cases each of heart and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> per 100,000 person-years in appropriately treated high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although population estimates such as these are useful, they must be translated repeatedly to individual patient-provider encounters, where clinical skill and art must combine with scientific evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The continued publication of individual case reports and small randomized trials among groups of patients with potential side effects should be encouraged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> should not be used in situations where minimal benefit is expected, as safety data and risk-benefit analysis must be meshed with guidelines that help the clinician decide whom to treat and how aggressively to treat </plain></SENT>
