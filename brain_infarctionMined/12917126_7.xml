<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> but also occurs secondary to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (CADASIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a characteristic feature, although symptomatic events are relatively rare, making large numbers necessary for evaluation of potential therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging is sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions and differentiates them from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detection of asymptomatic lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with diffusion-weighted imaging is a potential surrogate marker for treatment trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, the frequency of asymptomatic new lesions in ischemic leukoaraiosis and CADASIL was determined as a step toward assessing the potential of this technique as a surrogate marker of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> small vessel disease and 19 patients with CADASIL underwent diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had been asymptomatic for 3 months before imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images were screened by two raters for new lesions; lesions were confirmed as recent by a visible reduction of diffusivity on the corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recent ischemic lesions were identified in four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> small vessel disease (8.0%) and two patients with CADASIL (10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic new lesions are found in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> small vessel disease and CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of new lesions suggests that this approach has a potential role as a surrogate marker in therapeutic trials that warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
