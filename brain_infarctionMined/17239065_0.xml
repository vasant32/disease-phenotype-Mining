<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Results on the water and electrolyte complications associated with enteral tube feeding are inconsistent and this is partly because of uncontrolled disease-related variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Non-experimental design (retrospective study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted by retrospectively reviewing the medical records of 85 tube-fed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean values of major serum electrolytes (<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>) were not significantly altered by tube feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, differences between fluid input and output were significantly increased after tube feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> reduced overall, while over-hydration increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The enteral tube feeding of iso-osmolar formulae appeared to be tolerated by most subjects in the present study in terms of electrolyte balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, fluid imbalance and over-hydration incidences were significantly increased after tube feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Due to significant alterations in fluid balance after tube feeding, close attention to the recording of fluid balance, such as intake/output measurements, body weights and simple bedside assessments is needed to detect fluid imbalances and other serious complications at an early stage in enteral tube-feeding patients </plain></SENT>
