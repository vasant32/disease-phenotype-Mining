<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: There has been controversy about the aetiology and pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) related vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several pathogenic factors like endothelin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules have been discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recently published study concerning an exclusively Asian population suggested a relationship between SAH related vasospasm and the blood platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine this relationship in a European population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We carefully reviewed 88 patients with aneurysmal SAH (54 females, 34 males; mean age 52.5 years, range from 22 to 78 years) treated in our centre with regard to the occurrence of vasospasm and the blood platelet count in a ten day interval after initial SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic vasospasm was defined as a focal neurological deficit or deterioration in the level of consciousness with or without confirmation of infarction on a CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients (42%) developed clinically relevant vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant correlation between the blood platelet count chart (maximum and minimum values) and vasospasm or clinical outcome; we also found no gender or age-related influence on the above mentioned relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion there appears to be a difference between Caucasian and Asian populations regarding the influence of platelets in the pathophysiology of SAH and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
