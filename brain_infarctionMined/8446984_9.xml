<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because the frequency of hemorrhagic transformation of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is still a matter of controversy, we performed a prospective magnetic resonance imaging study in a series of consecutive patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Among 200 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 41 were identified with a computed tomographically proven supratentorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> due to cardiogenic embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted) was performed 3 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 35 of these 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images showed hemorrhagic transformation in 68.6% (24) of the 35 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, always without clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a stepwise forward logistic regression analysis only the volume of infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on the initial computed tomogram was linked significantly with the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhages</z:mp> were a regular finding on magnetic resonance images of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> exceeding a volume of 10 cm3 (94.4%, 17 of 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic transformation is a regular finding in medium-sized and large cardioembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in therapeutic and preventive studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> the severity, not the frequency, of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> into brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> should be the matter of interest </plain></SENT>
