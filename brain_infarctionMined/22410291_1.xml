<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> (Res), a natural <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> compound found in plants, shows potent neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effects; however, its ability to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain damage remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we tested whether Res played a neuroprotective role in a rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> model induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats were randomly assigned into four experimental groups: sham operation (sham), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> treatment (MCAO), Res-treated MCAO (Res+MCAO) and Res alone group (Res+sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain damage size and hippocampal apoptotic neurons in each rat were evaluated by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the hippocampus was assessed with extracellular recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins, i.e., Bcl-2 and Bax, in the hippocampus was detected by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that Res treatment significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of MCAO rats as compared to MCAO rats without Res treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in TUNEL-positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region was visualized in the MCAO rats as compared to that of the sham group, but this increase was attenuated with Res treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functionally, extracellular recordings revealed that MCAO operation impaired LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region and the basal synaptic transmission between the Schaffer collaterals, whereas Res treatment rescued the impaired LTP and facilitated synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Res treatment increased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in the MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that Res can attenuate the deleterious effects of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion-induced brain injury and function as a potential neuroprotective agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective qualities of Res, based on our data, may be attributable to the up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and down-regulation of Bax expression </plain></SENT>
