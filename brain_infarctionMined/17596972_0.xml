<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuroprotectants relies heavily on rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well know that some of the more common models used can exhibit a relatively high degree of inter animal variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This necessitates the need to increase the sample size per group and to run concomitant positive and negative control groups with each study in order to increase the consistency and reproducibility of the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As such, one aspect of these studies that has become more labor intensive is the measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume post study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Herein, we describe a simple method to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) stained brain sections utilizing an automated set of routines using standard software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method was first validated by determining the correlation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes derived from the manual measurements vs the automated method for the same samples across a wide range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This comparison resulted in a significant correlation (r=0.99) indicating that the automated method was a valid method to assess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume across a wide range in lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next, the automated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> analysis tool was used to determine the effect of (+)-MK801, a well known neuroprotectant, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated a significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in (+)-MK801 treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: These data demonstrate a simple, accurate automated routine to measure lesion volume in TTC stained sections </plain></SENT>
