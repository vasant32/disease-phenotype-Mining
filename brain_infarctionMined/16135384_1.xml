<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current pharmacological strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> largely mirror those employed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, important differences in the effectiveness and versatility of the principal agents have emerged between these 2 clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, the level of success achieved with drugs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes has not carried over to the same extent when the same drug types are used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The principal reason is that reperfusion or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapies in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> run a significant risk of hemorrhagic transformation that has no direct equivalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, a significant challenge in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapeutics is the ability to select patients for drugs where only a narrow therapeutic margin exists and to identify methods that can minimize <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other brain-specific vascular factors also pertain in explaining differences in outcome of drugs generally regarded as having a broad cardiovascular remit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relatively limited efficacy of antiplatelets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might relate to the composition and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the cerebrovascular lesion, while the poor outcome associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anti-hypertensive use is partly due to loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, downstream consequences of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> within the brain such as excitotoxicity and plasticity are organ specific and, as such, deserve their own pharmacological approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the general mechanism of each drug class used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and then report on the clinical experience and application for each </plain></SENT>
