<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypotheses that characterization of carotid plaques on spiral computed tomographic images correlates with that on computerized B-mode ultrasonographic images and that spiral computed tomographic imaging predicts the histomorphometric plaque content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 38 patients with neurologic symptoms and at least 50% stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic images and spiral computed tomographic images of carotid plaques were computer processed to yield a quantitative measure, the gray scale level of the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean Hounsfield value for spiral computed tomographic images correlated with the gray scale median for B-mode ultrasonographic images (univariate linear regression analysis: r = 0.45; P = .01) and the histologic content of calcification in the plaque (r = 0.34; P = .04) but not with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, or fibrous tissue in the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spiral computed tomographic imaging seems to correlate with B-mode ultrasonographic imaging for showing plaque characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spiral computed tomographic attenuation was also correlated with the amount of calcification noted on histologic examination but not with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the components thought to characterize vulnerable, rupture-prone plaques </plain></SENT>
