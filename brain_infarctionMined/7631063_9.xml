<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For further clinical application it seemed rational to investigate the possible vascular changes mediated by this technique in experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this aim, 45 New Zealand rabbits were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was produced by bilateral carotid ligation in 15, unilateral microcoagulation of the middle cerebral artery in 15 and by microcoagulation of the vertebral artery at the craniocervical junction in the other 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week later, following daily clinical scoring and cortical and posterior fossa blood flow readings by laser Doppler, a period of 120 min of right C1-C2 spinal cord electric stimulation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mean of 27% increase in previous blood flow recordings was obtained at the right hemisphere and a mean of 32% in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure was used in 10 patients presenting with various cerebral low perfusion syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Though not constant, an increase in alertness, retention, speech, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000712'>emotional lability</z:hpo> and performance in skilled acts was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> changes were observed, though SPECT readings showed an increase in blood flow in the penumbral perilesional area </plain></SENT>
