<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial (EPITHET) was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of alteplase between 3 and 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth attenuation on MRI with alteplase in mismatch patients was negative when mismatch volumes were assessed volumetrically, without coregistration, which underestimates mismatch volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that assessing the extent of mismatch by coregistration of perfusion and diffusion MRI maps may more accurately allow the effects of alteplase vs placebo to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: patients were classified as having mismatch if perfusion-weighted imaging divided by coregistered diffusion-weighted imaging volume ratio was &gt;1.2 and total coregistered mismatch volume was â‰¥ 10 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a comparison of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth in alteplase vs placebo patients with coregistered mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: of 99 patients with baseline diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging, coregistration of both images was possible in 95 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coregistered mismatch was present in 93% (88/95) compared to 85% (81/95) with standard volumetric mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the coregistered mismatch patients, of whom 45 received alteplase and 43 received placebo, the primary outcome measure of geometric mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth was significantly attenuated by a ratio of 0.58 with alteplase compared to placebo (1.02 vs 1.77; 95% CI, 0.33-0.99; P=0.0459) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: when using coregistration techniques to determine the presence of mismatch at study entry, alteplase significantly attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This highlights the necessity for a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial of alteplase using penumbral selection beyond 3 hours </plain></SENT>
