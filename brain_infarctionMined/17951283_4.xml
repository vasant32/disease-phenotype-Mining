<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined fibrinogen levels and variation in fibrinogen genes (fibrinogen gamma (FGG), alpha (FGA) and beta (FGB)), which have been associated with fibrin clot structure and fibrinogen levels, in relation to cerebral small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was performed as part of the Rotterdam Scan Study, a population based study in 1077 elderly patients undergoing cerebral MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma fibrinogen levels and haplotypes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between fibrinogen levels and haplotype with silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions using logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We constructed seven haplotypes (frequency &gt;0.01) that describe the total common variation in the FGG and FGA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype 2 (GATAGTG) was associated with the presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with the most frequent haplotype (GGTGGTA) (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype 3 (GGCGATA) was associated with periventricular white matter lesions in the highest tertile of the distribution (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was found between plasma fibrinogen levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for an association of common variation in the FGG and FGA genes with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the structure of the fibrin clot rather than plasma fibrinogen levels plays a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
