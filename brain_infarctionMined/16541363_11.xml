<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the Swiss neuropaediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry (SNPSR), from 1.1.2000 to 1.7.2002, including children (AIS 1) and neonates (AIS 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 18-24 months after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a follow-up examination was performed including a history, neurological and neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 33/48 children (22 AIS 1, 11 AIS 2) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome was good in 16/33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mean IQ levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (94), but 6 children had IQ &lt; 85 (50-82) and neuropsychological problems were present in 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Performance IQ (93) was reduced compared to verbal IQ (101, p = 0.121) due to problems in the domain of processing speed (89.5); auditory short-term memory was especially affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effects on school career were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome was worse in children after right-sided infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Children suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in mid-childhood had the best prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no clear relationship between outcome and localisation of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 7/11 children showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> indicated a worse prognosis in the remaining 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neuropsychological problems are present in about 75% of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as well as an emergence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were predictors for worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
