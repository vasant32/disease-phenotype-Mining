<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we uncovered a novel function of GM-CSF in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified the GM-CSF alpha-receptor as an upregulated gene in a screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced genes in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This receptor is broadly expressed on neurons throughout the brain together with its ligand and induced by ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In primary cortical neurons and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells, GM-CSF counteracts programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and induces BCL-2 and BCL-Xl expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the signaling pathways studied, GM-CSF most prominently induced the PI3K-Akt pathway, and inhibition of Akt strongly decreased antiapoptotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenously given GM-CSF passes the blood-brain barrier, and decreases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damage in two different experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models (middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and combined common carotid/distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) concomitant with induction of BCL-Xl expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, GM-CSF acts as a neuroprotective protein in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding is remarkably reminiscent of the recently discovered functionality of two other hematopoietic factors, erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The identification of a third hematopoietic factor acting as a neurotrophic factor in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> suggests a common principle in the functional evolution of these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinically, GM-CSF now broadens the repertoire of hematopoietic factors available as novel drug candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
