<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Occluding the middle cerebral artery of small animals with an intraluminal filament to build a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model has gained increasing acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In light of the growing demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies using the clinical MRI scanner, large animal models can be superior to small animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we developed a modified rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which was assessed using clinical MRI scanner and compared with a most commonly <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-coated filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We presented a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The key feature of this modified method is the use of a guide wire as a 'nylon suture' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the percentage of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, neurobehavioral score, intracranial hemorrhagic incidence and dynamic changes of T(2) and apparent diffusion coefficient values were assessed respectively and compared between the focal cerebral models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Wire-induced models had more severe brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size with less dispersion (32.7 +/- 6.5%, coefficient of variation=0.20) than that with filament models (25.4 +/- 8.9%, coefficient of variation=0.31; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were more significant MRI changes in the early stage, higher rate of technique success (wire, 20/20; filament, 17/20) and less <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (wire, 0/20; filament, 3/20) in wire-induced models than in filament-induced rabbits (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that wire-induced method can provide a useful tool for the earlier research of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
