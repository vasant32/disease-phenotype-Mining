<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to develop a reproducible method of mouse transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> by distal artery compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The distal middle cerebral artery (dMCA) was occluded by compression with a blunted needle, and cerebral blood flow was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry to ensure appropriate occlusion and reperfusion in Balb/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ischaemic lesion was evaluated 24 h after occlusion by TTC staining and immunolabelling (NeuN, CD31, GFAP and Iba-1) while the established permanent dMCA occlusion (dMCAO) model was used as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corner test was performed to evaluate neurological behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laser Doppler flowmetry register showed a homogenous <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> among animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-five minutes of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> did not lead <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> when evaluated by TTC staining 24 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extending the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> period to 60 min induced a cortically localized homogeneous brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were detected between animals submitted to permanent or 60-min transient dMCAO (42.33 ± 9.88 mm³ and 37.63 ± 12.09 mm³ respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ischaemic injury was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in the 60-min transient dMCAO model but not in the 45-min model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits assessed with the corner test were significant only during the first 48 h but not at long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This work shows an easy-to-perform method for the induction of brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and reperfusion to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> repair and treatment screening, with cortically localized ischaemic cell damage, low mortality and neurological impairment in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
