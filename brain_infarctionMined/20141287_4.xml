<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether the maladaptive effects of experience with the nonparetic limb are mediated through callosal connections and the contralesional sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male rats with proficiency in skilled reaching with their dominant (for reaching) forelimb received ischemic bilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions, or unilateral lesions, with or without callosal transections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After assessing dominant forelimb function (the paretic forelimb in rats with unilateral lesions), animals were trained with their nonparetic/nondominant forelimb or underwent control procedures for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were then tested with their paretic/dominant forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In animals with unilateral lesions only, nonparetic forelimb training worsened subsequent performance with the paretic forelimb, as found previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was not found in animals with both callosal transections and unilateral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After bilateral lesions, training the nondominant limb did not worsen function of the dominant limb compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the maladaptive effects of training the nonparetic limb on paretic forelimb function depend upon the contralesional cortex and transcallosal projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that this experience-dependent disruption of functional recovery is mediated through interhemispheric connections of the sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
