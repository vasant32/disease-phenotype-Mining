<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 88 patients diagnosed as having hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PMNL accumulation was studied using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (99mTc HMPAO)-labeled leukocyte brain single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was evaluated by CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mathew Scale was used for neurological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynamics of PMNL accumulation was studied at 3 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours and 6 to 9, 28 to 30, and 90 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In parallel, at admission, at 6 to 9 days, and at 28 to 30 days neurological outcome and infarction volume were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Generally, PMNL accumulation progressively increased during 6 to 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, remained at a high level up to 6 to 9 days and then declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the use of cluster analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were subdivided into three groups: patients with severe PMNL accumulation that dramatically increased within 12 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and persisted even at 28 to 30 days (group A); those with moderate PMNL accumulation that significantly decreased at 30 days (group B); and those with mild PMNL accumulation that decreased at 6 to 9 days (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline neurological deficit and brain tissue damage at admission appear to be at a similar level for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In dynamics, however, in patients with severe PMNL accumulation, neurological outcome was worse and infarction volume larger than in patients with less marked PMNL accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present clinical study confirms that PMNLs intensively accumulate in the regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that this accumulation correlated with the severity of the brain tissue damage and poor neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
