<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, serum S100B has been used as a secondary endpoint in some clinical trials in which serum S100B has successfully indicated the benefits or harm done by tested agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few reports describe serum S100B as an indicator of the efficiency of neuroprotective treatment in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models, although serum S100B may be as useful for histological and functional evaluations of neuroprotective treatments as in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study seeks to investigate the possibility that serum S100B reflects successful combined treatment with rt-PA and MK-801 in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of rats was produced via intra-arterial autologous clot injection, after which serum S100B levels were measured 24 h after embolism and the association of serum S100B levels with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> volume and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment with rt-PA and MK-801 significantly attenuated the elevation of serum S100B, which correlated significantly with reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> resulting from combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that serum S100B is a simple and objective indicator for successful neuroprotective therapy and would help seeking partners for combination treatments with rt-PA in an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assessments of the efficacy of combination treatments with rt-PA and neuroprotectants using serum S100B would facilitate translational research bridging laboratory and bedsides because serum S100B functions as a common marker in both rats and human patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
