<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that Rage <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were stimulated in the mouse brain after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases, RAGE expression was primarily associated with neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of RAGE-dependent pathway(s) post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> appears to have a neuroprotective role because mice genetically deficient for RAGE exhibited increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size 24 h after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of RAGE expression was also observed in primary neurons subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, an in vitro model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of neurons with low concentrations of S100B decreased neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation, and this effect was abolished by a neutralizing antibody against RAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, high concentrations of exogenous S100B had a cytotoxic effect that seems to be RAGE-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As an important novel finding, we demonstrate that hypoxic stimulation of RAGE expression is mediated by the transcription factor <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is supported by the finding that HIF-1alpha down-regulation by Cre-mediated excision drastically decreased RAGE induction by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we showed that the mouse RAGE promoter region contains at least one functional HIF-1 binding site, located upstream of the proposed transcription start site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A luciferase reporter construct containing this RAGE promoter fragment was activated by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and mutation at the potential HIF-1 binding site decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-dependent promoter activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific binding of HIF-1 to this putative HRE in hypoxic cells was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay </plain></SENT>
