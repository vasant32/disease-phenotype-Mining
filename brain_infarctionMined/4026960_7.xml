<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> may be important for hemostasis in vivo it was used to induce platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">Thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi>) formed during the aggregation was measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi> (1.5 g/kg) given to 8 healthy non-alcoholic male volunteers increased platelet reactivity to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and the associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> formation rose from 289 +/- 60 (mean +/- SE) to 984 +/- 263 fmol/10(7) platelets (p less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects lasted for as long as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> was present in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13 non-cirrhotic male alcoholics the withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> caused a 4-fold increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> formation within one week but the basal levels before <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> withdrawal were the same as in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed in relation to the higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> seen in alcoholics and even associated with binge drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to establish the effects of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> on prostacyclin formation </plain></SENT>
