<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuroinflammation following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induces secondary injury in the region surrounding the insult, thus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi> are potential neuroprotectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> is one such agent possessing neuroprotective properties, however many studies examining <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> have used minimal delays between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and treatment, short survival periods, and lack measures of functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such studies do not distinguish whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> provides sustained protection or merely delays cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to address some of these concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with multiple doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> (45 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle beginning 2.5 h after endothelin-1-induced focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measures of forelimb asymmetry and skilled reaching (staircase test) were used to determine functional outcome 7, 15 and 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term functional assessment indicates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> provides limited benefit in the staircase test, but confers long-term benefit in the forelimb asymmetry test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subcortical and whole hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were reduced by 41 and 39% respectively in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> attenuated long-term white matter damage adjacent to the striatal injury core, which correlated with sustained functional benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that delayed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> treatment improves long-term functional outcome which is linked to protection of both white and gray matter </plain></SENT>
