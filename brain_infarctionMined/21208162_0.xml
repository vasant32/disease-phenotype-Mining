<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since temperature is a key determinant of brain damage following an ischemic insult, the objective was to investigate whether alterations in post-ischemic temperature regulation contribute to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi>-induced reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (190-280 g) were assigned to either control diet (18% protein) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> induced by feeding a low protein diet (2% protein) for 7 days prior to either global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a rapid disruption in thermoregulatory function in rats fed the low protein diet as assessed by continuous recording of core temperature with bio-electrical sensor transmitters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both daily temperature fluctuation and mean temperature increased within the first 24 hours, and these remained significantly elevated throughout the 7 day pre-ischemic period (p &lt; 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the immediate post-surgical period, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005534'>decreased body temperature</z:mp> to a greater extent than that in well-nourished controls (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in daily temperature fluctuation caused by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> persisted throughout the 7 day post-surgical period (p &lt; 0.001), and this interacted with the effects of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on days 8 (p = 0.018) and 11 (p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The astrocytic and microglial responses induced at 7 days after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were not influenced by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi>, but this preliminary analysis needs to be confirmed with a more reliable global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, exposure to a low protein diet rapidly impairs the ability to maintain thermoregulatory homeostasis, and the resultant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> also diminishes the ability to thermoregulate in response to a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since temperature regulation is a key determinant of brain injury following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, these findings suggest that the pathophysiology of brain injury could be altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victims with coexisting <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
