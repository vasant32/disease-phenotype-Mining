<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the etiologic mechanisms and topographic features of bihemispheric infarctions depicted on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 411 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, DWI showed bilateral infarctions in 19 (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients, we analyzed the presence of carotid, aortic or cardiac embolic sources by using ultrasonography, cerebral angiography, and/or transesophageal echocardiography and evaluated the size and topographic distribution of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed intracranial cross-flow through the anterior communicating artery, mainly on the basis of the anatomic information obtained from angiography or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bilateral lesions were derived from cardiac and/or aortic embolic sources in 16 (84%) of 19 patients and appeared to originate from unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid diseases</z:e> in three (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In nine (82%) of 11 patients with cardiac embolic sources, at least one large territorial or subcortical lesion was found in either hemisphere, whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients without a cardiac embolic source, the lesions were small and disseminated bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unilateral carotid lesions can cause bihemispheric infarctions through cross-flow in the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On DWI, small bihemispheric, disseminated lesions strongly suggest an artery-to-artery embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In such cases, aortic and carotid lesions should be assessed as potential embolic sources </plain></SENT>
