<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 14-year-old Congo African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) was evaluated for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of falling off of its perch and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonic-clonic movements</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FINDINGS: Clinical signs were consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings on whole-body radiography, CBC, and plasma biochemical analysis were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, ionized calcium, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> concentrations were within reference limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the head revealed the presence of a focal hyperintensity at the central to left side of the optic chiasm and a hyperintense focus in the right side of the midbrain area in T2-weighted and FLAIR pulse sequence images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings were most consistent with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with 2 brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were initially managed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32030">potassium bromide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of poor results and difficulties to reach therapeutic blood concentrations, the treatment plan was changed to levetiracetam and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10127">zonisamide</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood concentrations were monitored for both drugs, and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> substantially decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A follow-up MRI examination 2 months later revealed resolution of the hyperintense signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the 20-month follow-up period, subsequent clusters of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were managed by adjusting levetiracetam and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10127">zonisamide</z:chebi> dosages and adding clonazepam and gabapentin administration to the treatment plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regression of intraparenchymal hyperintense lesions and improvement of clinical signs made a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> most likely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings for this Congo African grey parrot indicated that an antemortem diagnosis of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> followed by long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> management may be possible in affected psittacines </plain></SENT>
