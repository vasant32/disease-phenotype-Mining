<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in selected patients with mitral annular calcification, adjusting for clinical, echocardiographic and therapeutic factors influencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 8,160 consecutive patients with echocardiograms, 657 with and 562 without mitral annulus calcification were followed for a mean of 2.4 years (range 1-6.6) to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk by means of proportional hazards models with clinical, echocardiographic, and therapeutic variables that influence the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined the association of mitral annulus calcification with subtypes of ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> generally considered to be specific for an underlying cardioembolic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore distinguished between territorial, small deep, and asymptomatic (silent) brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients with mitral annulus calcification and 27 controls had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mitral annulus calcification was not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in proportional hazards models (hazard ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.42-1.36, P = 0.3), or with any of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, or with the presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after adjustments for risk factors for generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and carotid atheroma, with or without stenosis, ipsilateral or contralateral to the side of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study does not support the view that mitral annulus calcification is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As others have found strong associations between mitral annulus calcification and cardiac and vascular risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with mitral annulus calcification reported may be explained by these confounding risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in our opinion, mitral annulus calcification requires treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, but generally no specific measures such as surgery or oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> are required to lower the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
