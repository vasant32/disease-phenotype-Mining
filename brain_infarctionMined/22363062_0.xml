<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 135 consecutive patients who underwent CT angiography of the head and neck and PCT of the brain at baseline and with subsequent follow-up brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic information and carotid wall features were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation was assessed anatomically at CT angiography and functionally by measuring the mean transit time delay at PCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical, carotid, CT angiography, and PCT variables were compared between those with and without new incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at follow-up imaging using mixed effect logistic statistical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 15 patients developed a new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 120 patients did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical features associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk were age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The carotid features associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk were wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anatomic assessment of collaterals on CT angiography was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, whereas the functional assessment of collaterals (mean transit time delay on PCT) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and mean transit time delay (OR, 22.8; P&lt;0.001) were the only covariates that were independent predictors of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mean transit time delay on PCT contains important physiological information and should not be discarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Along with age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, this functional assessment of intracranial collateral circulation predicts the risk of future hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
