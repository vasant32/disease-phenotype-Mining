<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the neuroprotective effects of T33, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma/alpha (PPARγ/α) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic models in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary astrocytes subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation/reperfusion (O/R) and BV-2 cells subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> were used as a model simulating the ischemic core and penumbra, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured using qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of TNF-α secreted by BV-2 cells were measured using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), p65, phosphorylated I-κBα/I-κBα, phosphorylated I-κB kinase (pIKK), phosphorylated eukaryote initiation factor 2α (p-eIF-2α)/eIF-2α and p-p38/p38 were detected using Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PPARγ activity was measured using EMSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection in vivo was examined in rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model with neurological scoring and TTC staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Addition of T33 (0.5 μmol/L) increased the level of I-κBα protein in primary astrocytes subjected to O/R, which was due to promoting protein synthesis without affecting degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary astrocytes subjected to O/R, addition of T33 amplified I-κBα gene transcription and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> translation, thus suppressing the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> (TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BV-2 cells subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, T33 (0.5 μmol/L) reduced TNF-α, COX-2, and p-P38 production, which was antagonized by pre-administration of the specific PPARγ <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> GW9662 (30 μmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>T33 (2 mg/kg, ip) attenuated MCAO-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, which was antagonized by pre-administered GW9662 (4 mg/kg, ip) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: T33 exerted anti-inflammatory effects in the ischemic core and penumbra via PPARγ activation, which contributed to its neuroprotective action </plain></SENT>
