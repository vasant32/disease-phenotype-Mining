<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Without aura the patient noticed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> due to left <z:hpo ids='HP_0011349'>abducens palsy</z:hpo>, and exophthal mos and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain CT revealed extrusion of the left eye, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of left superior orbital vein and cerebral cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She received diagnosis of CCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain CT also revealed a small mass in the left ethmoidal sinus, which was not attached to the CCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of the mass was done under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the following she had high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her consciousness level deteriorated and she developed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> FLAIR images of MRI showed, extensive high signal lesions in the left frontal and temporal cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain and pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were consisted with venous infarction, possibly associated with peri-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occur in 3% of cases with CCF, but venous infarction was much rarer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with CCF, who show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of cortical veins in CT or MRI, have a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or infarction, and should be carefully observed </plain></SENT>
