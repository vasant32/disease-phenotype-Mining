<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CINN was administered intraperitoneally either 15 min before (pretreatment) or 2 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (postischemic treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative to vehicle-treated controls, animals pretreated with CINN, at 20-80 mg/kg, had significant reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by 33-46% and improvements in neurobehavioral outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postischemic administration with CINN (80 mg/kg) also significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by 43% and ameliorated neurobehavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, CINN administration significantly attenuated in situ accumulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anions</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi>) in the boundary zones of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 4 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, CINN-treated animals exhibited significantly decreased levels of oxidative damage, as assessed by immunopositive reactions for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> (4-HNE), and the resultant inflammatory reactions at 24 h post-insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CINN effectively reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and improved neurobehavioral outcome following a short-term recovery period after severe transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of a decreased extent of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage observed with CINN treatment highlights that its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and radical scavenging ability is contributory </plain></SENT>
