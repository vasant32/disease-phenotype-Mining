<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy volunteers served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time courses of N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>), total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> containing compounds (Cho), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by SPECT were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level was found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content decreased to barely detectable levels during the following two to four weeks, while rCBF increased during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The content of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> in infarcted tissue was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01) compared to healthy controls, Cr was also reduced (p &lt; 0.02), whereas Cho content did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inverse relationship between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level and cerebral blood flow suggests that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> plays no substantial role in the vasodilatation underlying the hyperaemia that follows reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reflects the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in the affected region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The content of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> may be used as a neuronal marker, and thus perhaps as a marker of the effect of future treatment procedures </plain></SENT>
