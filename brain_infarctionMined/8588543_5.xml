<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional status was graded according to the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had primary intra-cerebral haemorrhage, 22 deep hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, 17 had anterior circulation cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, five had posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and in nine the CT scan was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
