<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental models of preconditioning primarily focus on neurons as the cellular target of cerebral protection, while less attention has been paid to the cerebrovascular compartment, whose role in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that preconditioning with polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly-ICLC) protects against cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To delineate the mechanism of poly-ICLC protection, we investigated whether poly-ICLC preconditioning preserves the function of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) in response to ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> model, we found that poly-ICLC treatment prior to exposure to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation maintained the paracellular and transcellular transport across the endothelium and attenuated the drop in transendothelial electric resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that poly-ICLC treatment induced interferon (IFN) Î² <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in astrocytes and microglia and that type I IFN signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells was required for protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this implicates a potential mechanism underlying neuroprotection in our in vivo experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, where type I IFN signaling is required for poly-ICLC-induced neuroprotection against ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we are the first to show that preconditioning with poly-ICLC attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mechanism is likely an important feature of poly-ICLC-mediated neuroprotection and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> signaling pathways to protect the brain against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
