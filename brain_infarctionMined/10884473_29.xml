<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17154">nicotinamide</z:chebi> (NAm) acutely reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> induced by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate whether NAm may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury by improving sensory and motor behavior as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volumes in a model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats were used, and transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by MCAo for 2 hours, followed by reperfusion for either 3 or 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated with either intraperitoneal saline or NAm (500 mg/kg) 2 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAo (ie, on reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensory and motor behavior scores and body weight were obtained daily, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> volumes were measured on euthanasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to treatment with saline, treatment with NAm (500 mg/kg IP) 2 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in Wistar rats significantly improved sensory (38%, P&lt;0.005) and motor (42%, P&lt;0.05) neurological behavior and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (7%, P&lt;0.05) up to 7 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were also reduced 46% (P&lt;0.05) at 3 days and 35% (P=0.09) at 7 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NAm is a robust neuroprotective agent against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced brain injury in rats, even when administered up to 2 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed NAm treatment improved both anatomic and functional indices of brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify whether multiple doses of NAm will improve the extent and duration of this neuroprotective effect and to determine the mechanism(s) of action underlying the neuroprotection observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because NAm is already used clinically in large doses and has few side effects, these results are encouraging for the further examination of the possible use of NAm as a therapeutic neuroprotective agent in the clinical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
