<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We highlight the technical applications of this technique during 5 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three women (age 68, 69, and 83 years) and 1 man (age 79 years) were treated using brachial artery access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the women with complex posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with stent-assisted coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The third woman presented with a symptomatic occlusion of the basilar artery and underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis and angioplasty, followed at a later date by a second intra-arterial thrombolysis procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The male patient presented with recurrent, intractable posterior circulation ischemic events and underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of a high-grade stenosis of the right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had failed treatment via a transfemoral route and demonstrated significant thoracoaortic and/or iliofemoral tortuosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Appropriate intracranial vascular access was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and there were no intraprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a transbrachial approach may be successfully used for a variety of therapeutic neuroendovascular interventions when a transfemoral route is not available </plain></SENT>
