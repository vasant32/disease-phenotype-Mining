<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine if there is an association between brain computed tomography (CT) findings and place of residence in a series of hip fracture patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The CT scans taken immediately after hip fracture of 215 patients (mean age 81.6 years) living in their own homes or otherwise independently (home-dwelling group) and 95 patients (mean age 82.5 years) permanently institutionalized (institutionalized group) were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The institutionalized patients had significantly more cortical cerebral (frontal, p = 0.004; temporal, p = 0.007; parietal, p &lt; 0.001) and central cerebral (third ventricle width, p &lt; 0.001; frontal horn width, p &lt; 0.001; midbody width, p &lt; 0.001) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> than the home-dwelling ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was also true of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the white-matter (WM) area (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The institutionalized patients also had more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the cerebellar hemisphere (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the cerebellopontine angle cistern, p = 0.002, greater fourth ventricle width, p = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen in the incidence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture patients living in institutions have more brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> than those living independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> may be one factor in the multiple mechanism underlying their institutional admission </plain></SENT>
