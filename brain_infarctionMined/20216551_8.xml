<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since a pioneer work that has shown in vitro that the rat's fibrinolytic system is 10-fold less sensitive to recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rtPA) than the human system, most preclinical studies are performed with 10 instead of 0.9 mg/kg rtPA (the clinical dose in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the effects of these doses on mean time to reperfusion, reperfusion slope, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in a rat model of thrombo-embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence that the dose of 0.9 mg/kg rtPA is as appropriate as that of 10 mg/kg for preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies in rodents </plain></SENT>
