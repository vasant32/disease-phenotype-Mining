<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between WML and cognitive functions of patients suffering from Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive Impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the association between WML on CT brain scan and cognitive functions in 136 consecutive elderly subjects attending a geriatric outpatient clinic, suffering from MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The global cognitive assessment was based on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), a validated comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, the Cognitive Efficiency Profile (CEP), a CT brain scan and a complete biological screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WML on CT brain scan was evaluated by a blinded investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this population, 75 +/- 8 years of age, (women 60%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> 54%), 33% of subjects had WML on CT brain scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with WML were significantly older (OR=1.27; IC 95%=1.04 - 1.22), had more frequently a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR=2.71; IC 95%=1.06 - 6.96) and more frequently lacunae associated with WML (OR=4.48; IC 95%=1.18 - 16.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with WML had significantly poorer cognitive functions than those without WML (CEP score/100=62.33 +/- 13.58 versus 71.87 +/- 14.19, p&lt;0.01 and MMSE score/30=27.02 +/- 2.34 versus 27.97 +/- 1.89, p&lt;0.01) CONCLUSION: Our results showed a relationship between WML on CT brain scan and the depth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> among MCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further long term prospective studies have to be performed to determinate if WML are involved in transitions between MCI and Alzheimer' s disease </plain></SENT>
