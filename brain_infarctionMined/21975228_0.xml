<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: The REgistro NAcional Mexicano de Enfermedad VAScular Cerebral (RENAMEVASC) is a hospital-based multicenter registry performed between November 2002 and October 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 2000 patients with clinical syndromes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease confirmed by neuroimaging were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin scale was used for outcome stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: We analyzed 1721 patients who had registered their SBP: 78 (4.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, 894 (51.9%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 534 (30.9%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 165 (9.6%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and 50 (2.9%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 1036 (60.2%) patients with the antecedent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, only 32.4% had regular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 30-day case fatality rate presented a J pattern with respect to SBP, so that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was highest in &lt;100 mmHg (37.5%), decreased between 100 and 139, and reached gradually a new zenith in ?220 mmHg (35.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The best functional outcome corresponded to patients who had SBP between 100 mmHg and 159 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a Cox proportional hazards model, SBP &lt;100 mmHg or ?220 mmHg was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality (RR: 1.52, IC 95%: 1.07 - 2.15), as well as the antecedent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (RR: 1.33, IC 95%: 1.06 - 1.65) and age &gt;65 years (RR: 2.16, IC 95%: 1.74 - 2.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and significant arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> at hospital admission are associated with an adverse outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a good functional outcome can be attained in a wide range of SBP </plain></SENT>
