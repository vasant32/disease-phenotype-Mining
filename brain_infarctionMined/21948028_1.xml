<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive and rapid blood marker to detect ischemic brain injury, because imaging techniques have a limited capacity to identify lesions during the first crucial hours without massive tissue destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for various durations (0.5-3 hr), followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At different time points after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, the amounts of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were analyzed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was observed in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-duration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GFAP was drastically increased in the CSF 24 and 48 hr after reperfusion, without change in the serum level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of MAP2 remarkably increased as early as 0.5 hr of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, much earlier than the observation of minimal tissue injury 3 hr following occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum MAP2 level was further increased by a short period (2 hr) of reperfusion, even in 0.5- and 1-hr ischemic rats, despite not observing any typical tissue injuries 24 hr after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the MAP2 protein may be able to detect early neuronal injuries, because the level of this protein in the blood spikes before the appearance of visible macrolesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, MAP2 could potentially be used as a novel early marker for the detection of a neurotoxic insult </plain></SENT>
