<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> carriers for gene therapy have been developed to minimize carrier cytotoxicity and to enhance transfection efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we synthesized a 9-arginine-based reducible high molecular weight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> for gene delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the reducible poly(oligo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15816">D-arginines</z:chebi>) (rPOA), 9-arginine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptides</z:chebi> are connected by internal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> linkages to produce a high molecular weight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, rPOA was evaluated as a carrier of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) -induced brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An in vitro transfection assay showed that rPOA had higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than polyethylenimine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53231">PEI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For in vivo evaluation, I/R rat models were produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>rPOA/HO-1 expression plasmid (pHO-1) polyplexes were injected into the brain at 1 h before MCAO, and HO-1 expression levels in the brain were then measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes had higher transfection efficiencies than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53231">PEI</z:chebi>/pHO-1 polyplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rPOA/pHO-1 polyplexes significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) was reduced in the rPOA/pHO-1 polyplex injection group, suggesting that HO-1 had an anti-inflammatory effect, while the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53231">PEI</z:chebi>/pHO-1 polyplex did not show this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rPOA is a potential non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector for HO-1 gene therapy to protect brain cells from I/R-related neuronal injury including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
