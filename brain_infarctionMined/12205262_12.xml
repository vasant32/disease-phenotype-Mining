<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Children with neurologic impairments have shown diminished pain response compared with control subjects; however, it remains unclear what mechanisms underlie this response or when it develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If this were also true with premature infants who undergo neonatal intensive care, then infants with parenchymal brain injury (PBI) would be at increased risk of underrecognition and undertreatment of procedural pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether infants with PBI display altered responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural pain at 32 weeks' postconceptional age (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared responses to blood collection by heel lance at 32 weeks' <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in 12 very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> infants (mean [range] birth weight: 876 g [630-1240 g]; gestational age: 26.3 weeks (24-28 weeks) who had sustained PBI in the neonatal period, with 12 control subjects matched for gestational age at birth and gender (838 g [625-990 g]; 26.3 weeks [24-28 weeks[) who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neonatal brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBI was defined as cerebral parenchymal infarction (grade 4 <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>) or cystic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo> on serial cranial ultrasound scans conducted in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biobehavioral responses to pain were measured using facial activity (Neonatal Facial Coding System) and measures of heart rate (HR) variability (low-frequency [LF] power [0.04-0.15], high-frequency <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29228">[HF]</z:chebi> power [0.15-0.8 Hz], and LF/HF ratio) as a measure of cardiac autonomic modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental follow-up was undertaken at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The infants with PBI had significantly higher illness severity scores at day 1 compared with day 3 (Score of Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp> II: 32.1 vs 19.8) but similar previous pain experiences (109 vs 115) and total <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> exposure (0.29 vs 0.30 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups of children mounted similar responses to heel lance at 32 weeks' <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> with no difference in facial response or HR variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean HR and facial action scores increased from baseline to the lance, whereas LF, HF, and the LF/HF ratio decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No group differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only statistically significant difference between groups was that infants with PBI had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0010808'>tongue protrusion</z:hpo> at lance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental follow-up showed 8 of 11 toddlers with PBI had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> compared with 0% of control toddlers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Psychomotor Developmental Index score on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II was significantly lower in the PBI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five of 11 toddlers with PBI had Mental Developmental Index score &lt;2 standard deviations below mean compared with 0% of the control toddlers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contrary to expectations, we did not find any evidence of an altered pain response pattern in infants with proven brain injury in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although most infants with PBI developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, these findings suggest that cerebral injury predominantly to the central white matter leaves brainstem responses intact in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it seems that the injured brain of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infant</z:e> has not yet expressed the identifiable differences in pain display and the functional impairment observed at later ages </plain></SENT>
