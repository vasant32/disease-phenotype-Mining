<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the prevalence of bright basal ganglia and its clinical significance in patients with long-standing portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the absence of liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six patients with angiographically proven complete portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and cavernomatous transformation without signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> were studied by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, neuropsychiatric evaluation, psychometric tests, electroencephalography, and determination of arterial ammonia levels and of serum <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> concentrations from peripheral venous blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five out of six patients demonstrated increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overt portal-systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> was not noted prior to or at the time of evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> EEG results were recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one of the six patients had pathological results in at least two out of four psychometric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This latter patient had had a large right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial ammonia concentrations were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in four of the six patients; one patient with increased ammonia levels had concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002157'>azotemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other four patients had no relevant concomitant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> levels were non-significantly increased compared with a control group (p=0.06), but they were significantly correlated to basal ganglia signal intensity (R=0.88; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that bright basal ganglia primarily represent shunt-induced alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They are not directly associated with disturbed liver function nor with portal-systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
