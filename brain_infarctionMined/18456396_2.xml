<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 35 demographically-matched controls were followed-up for 28.6 months (range 19.4-45.9 months) with psychometric assessments performed at baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were more impaired than controls in general and executive functions at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups had similar stability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> psychometric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients, but not controls, exhibited a trend for improvement in general cognitive functions overtime (interaction term, p=0.084) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient who was non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> at baseline became <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two (5.7%) and five (8.2%) incident cerebrovascular events occurred among the controls and patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses performed upon patients failed to identify any predictor for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Similar to controls, cognition in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is stable during the first 2-3 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There maybe a spontaneous improvement in general cognition overtime, but this awaits confirmation by future studies </plain></SENT>
