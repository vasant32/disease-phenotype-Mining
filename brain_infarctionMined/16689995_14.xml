<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (IR) triggers a complex series of biochemical events including <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">Leukotrienes</z:chebi> derived from 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and are thus involved in the pathobiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test the neuroprotective efficacy of 5-LOX inhibition in a rat model of focal cerebral IR, ischemic animals were either pre- or post-treated with a potent selective 5-LOX inhibitor, (N- [3-[3-(-fluorophenoxy) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>]-1-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-2-propenyl]-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (BW-B 70C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated at 24 h after reperfusion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, neurological deficit score, and the expression of 5-LOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mechanism and the anti-inflammatory potential of BW-B 70C in the regulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and inflammatory inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) were investigated both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Both pre- and post-treatment with BW-B 70C reduced infarctions and improved neurological deficit scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study of brain sections showed IR-mediated increased expression of 5-LOX in the neurons and microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BW-B 70C down-regulated 5-LOX and inhibited iNOS expression by preventing NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two other structurally different 5-LOX inhibitors were also administered post IR: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36281">caffeic acid</z:chebi> and 2,3,5-trimethyl-6-[12-hydroxy-5,10-dodecadiynyl]-1,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> (AA-861) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As with BW-B 70C, they provided remarkable neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro, BW-B 70C inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) mediated nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production, iNOS induction and NF-kappaB activation in the BV2 microglial cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treating rat primary microglia with BW-B70C confirmed blockage of LPS-mediated translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB from cytosol to nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of 5-LOX inhibition through down-regulation of NF-kappaB in a rat model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
