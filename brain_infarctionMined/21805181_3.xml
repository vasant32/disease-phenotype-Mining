<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here included 715 subjects with baseline Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) plasma measurement (50% with 4 serial annual measurements): 205 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi>, 348 patients mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and 162 with AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the factors that modified their concentrations and correlated these values with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53725">PIB</z:chebi> PET, MRI and tau and Aβ(1-42) measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association between Aβ and diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of health conditions were associated with altered concentrations of plasma Aβ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of age differed according to AD stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma Aβ(1-42) showed mild correlation with other biomarkers of Aβ pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal measurements of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) plasma levels showed modest value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our longitudinal study of complementary measures of Aβ pathology (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53725">PIB</z:chebi>, CSF and plasma Aβ) and other biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is significant because it shows that plasma Aβ measurements have limited value for disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, with longer follow-up, within subject plasma Aβ measurements could be used as a simple and minimally invasive screen to identify those at increased risk for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the biology and dynamics of plasma Aβ as well as the need for longer term studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma Aβ </plain></SENT>
