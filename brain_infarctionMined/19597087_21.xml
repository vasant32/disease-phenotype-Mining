<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although cigarette smokers are at increased risk of developing multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), the effect of smoking on the progression of MS remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish the relationship between cigarette smoking and progression of MS using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey and longitudinal follow-up for a mean of 3.29 years, ending January 15, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Partners MS Center (Boston, Massachusetts), a referral center for patients with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Study participants included 1465 patients with clinically definite MS (25.1% men), with mean (range) age at baseline of 42.0 (16-75) years and disease duration of 9.4 (0-50.4) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred eighty patients (53.2%) were never-smokers, 428 (29.2%) were ex-smokers, and 257 (17.5%) were current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking groups were compared for baseline clinical and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics as well as progression and sustained progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale at 2 and 5 years and time to disease conversion to secondary progressive MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the rate of on-study change in the brain parenchymal fraction and T2 hyperintense lesion volume were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Current smokers had significantly worse disease at baseline than never-smokers in terms of Expanded Disability Status Scale score (adjusted P &lt; .001), Multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>Sclerosis</z:mp> Severity Score (adjusted P &lt; .001), and brain parenchymal fraction (adjusted P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, current smokers were significantly more likely to have primary progressive MS (adjusted odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-5.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At longitudinal analyses, MS in smokers progressed from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive disease faster than in never-smokers (hazard ratio for current smokers vs never-smokers, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-4.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, in smokers, the T2-weighted lesion volume increased faster (P = .02), and brain parenchymal fraction decreased faster (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cigarette smoke has an adverse influence on the progression of MS and accelerates conversion from a relapsing-remitting to a progressive course </plain></SENT>
