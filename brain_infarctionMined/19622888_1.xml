<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the frequency and risk factors of gastrointestinal (GI) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 920 patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> from January 2001 to October 2005 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the available medical records for any episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo>, possible precipitating factors and administration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (7.8%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo>; these patients were of an older age (74.7 vs. 69.0 years, p &lt; 0.001), had a longer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ward stay (30.4 vs. 12.9 days, p &lt; 0.001) and higher mortality rate (odds ratio 9.61, CI 4.53-20.42) than patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the important risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 779 patients who had a 0-1 risk factor, 26 (3.3%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo>; of the 27 patients with more than 2 risk factors, 17 (63%) suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study of Asians revealed a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> than that reported in previous studies, and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>GI hemorrhage</z:hpo> was positively correlated with the number of risk factors present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> may allow clinicians to set up <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> prophylactic protocols for the patients most likely to benefit, especially in an Asian population </plain></SENT>
