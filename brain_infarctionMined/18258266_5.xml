<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous neuroprotective agents have been shown to augment Akt activity, suggesting that this protein represents a major mechanism of cellular salvage after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> is known to augment Akt, but the possibility that Akt plays a differential role in the male and female brain has yet to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we employed both pharmacological and genetic approaches to investigate the role of Akt in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model we show that deletion of the Akt1 isoform does not affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome in either male or female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Akt1 deficient mice had equivalent levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) when compared to their WT controls following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> suggesting that alternative isoforms can compensate for Akt1 loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>'s neuroprotective effect is maintained in Akt1(-/-) mice and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> exposure did not enhance p-Akt levels in WT female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, we show that inhibiting Akt using the direct pan-Akt inhibitor triciribine has no effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome despite dramatic reductions in p-Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates the limitations of genetic mouse models and suggests that the importance of Akt to ischemic outcome remains unclear </plain></SENT>
