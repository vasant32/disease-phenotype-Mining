<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male rats underwent 2 hours of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vehicle or TPO (0.03 to 1.00 μg/kg) was administered intravenously immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and swelling, neurologic deficits, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), TPO and c-Mpl (TPO receptor) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, MMP-9 enzyme activity and protein expression, and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) were subsequently measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCAO reperfusion produced a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and swelling after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin significantly reduced these in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most effective TPO dose, 0.1 μg/kg, when administrated immediately or 2 hours after reperfusion, significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and swelling and ameliorated neurologic deficits after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-induced increases in cortical MMP-9 mRNA, enzyme activity and protein expression, TIMP-1 mRNA, and Evans blue extravasation were reduced by TPO intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin did not alter cortical TPO or c-Mpl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, blood pressure, heart rate, blood hematocrit, or platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of TPO's efficacy in reducing ischemic brain injury and improving functional outcome, partly by inhibiting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced increase in MMP-9 and the early, negative effects on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
