<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Both for hemicraniectomy and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, several reports describe a beneficial effect in patients with malignant supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the safety and the clinical outcome in patients with a malignant supratentorial infarction who were treated with hemicraniectomy alone (HA) or received a combination therapy with hemicraniectomy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> of 35 degrees C (HH), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective and randomized study, 25 consecutive patients were treated after an ischemic infarction of more than two thirds of one hemisphere by HA (n=13 patients) or the HH combination therapy (n=12 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety parameters were compared between both treatment groups, the clinical outcome was assessed during treatment and after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age, cranial CT or MRI findings, initial National institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale Score (NIHSSS) and level of consciousness were not significantly different between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemicraniectomy was performed within 15+/- 6 h after the ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> was induced immediately after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 12% (2/13 vs. 1/12 in the two groups), but none of these 3 patients died due to treatment-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no severe side effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duration of need for intensive care or for mechanical ventilation and infectious status did not differ significantly between both groups, but the need for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> application was increased in the HH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome showed a tendency for a better outcome in the HH compared with the HA group with respect to status after 6 months, as assessed by the NIHSSS (10+/-1 vs. 11+/-3, p&lt;0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that a combined therapy of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and hemicraniectomy in malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> does not imply additional risks by side effects and improves functional outcome as compared with hemicraniectomy alone </plain></SENT>
