<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous study described the neuroprotective effects of catalpol in gerbil ischemic model, in which catalpol was shown to prevent hippocampal neurons from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and ameliorate the cognitive ability of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the study, we focused on investigating the neuroprotective mechanism of catalpol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly assigned three groups as sham-operated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-treated with saline and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-treated with catalpol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced by a 5 min occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Catalpol was intraperitoneally injected at the dose of 5 mg/kg immediately after reperfusion and repeatedly at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology as well as immunohistochemistry and TUNEL (the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> nick end label) analysis were performed on serial slices through the dorsal hippocampus after gerbils were sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 5 min transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 4 days reperfusion caused significant increases in TUNEL-positive and Bax-positive cells in hippocampal CA1 subfield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Catalpol not only significantly reduced TUNEL-positive and Bax-positive cells but also significantly increased Bcl-2-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these suggested that catalpol could effectively inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by modulating the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax genes </plain></SENT>
