<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether selective stimulation of neurons of the sympathoinhibitory ventral periaqueductal gray (VPAG), or sympathoexcitatory dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG), differentially modulates CBF and EEG and exerts neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation of either regions of PAG comparably elevated AP and CBF, whereas chemical stimulation with the D,<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17588">L-homocysteine</z:chebi> produced either sympathoinhibition accompanied by decrease in CBF from ventral region or sympathoexcitation accompanied by increase in CBF from dorsal region in nonspinalized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CBF effects evoked from DPAG and VPAG by chemical stimulation were preserved in spinalized rats supporting that the evoked CBF responses result directly from stimulation and are not secondary to AP changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of either region, whether chemical or electrical, synchronized the EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To explore whether PAG stimulation might protect the brain against ischemic injury, in other rats the VPAG or DPAG were stimulated for 1 h (50 Hz, 1 s on/1 s off, 75-100 microA) and the middle cerebral artery occluded 72 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the DPAG, but not VPAG, significantly reduced infarction volumes relative to sham-stimulated controls as determined 24 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevations of AP and CBF did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude: (a). intrinsic neurons of D- and VPAG differentially regulate CBF; (b). neurons of DPAG are neuroprotective independently of changes in CBF and/or AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DPAG effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume may be related to the central neuroprotective pathway evoked by stimulation of the cerebellar FN </plain></SENT>
