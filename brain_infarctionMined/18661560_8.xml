<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DTTs were obtained in the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (5-30 days) and were classified into two groups (type A: the integrity of corticospinal tract was preserved around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; type B: corticospinal tract was interrupted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DTT type A patients showed better motor function than the type B patients at 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DTT obtained at the early stage of pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> appears to have predictive value for motor outcome in patients with pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
