<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 190 type 2 diabetic outpatients (mean age 62.7&amp;emsp14;years), the authors related baseline levels of soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) to subsequent brain MRI findings and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors assessed incident SBIs and changes in periventricular and subcortical WMLs (PVWMLs and SCWMLs) on MRI performed at baseline and 3 and 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests were administered to 83 patients older than 65 years at 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This present study represents an extension of the authors' previously published study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SBIs were observed in 46 patients (24.2%), PVWMLs in 93 (48.9%) and SCWMLs in 87 (45.8%) on baseline MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, baseline MRI findings and medication use, the relative odds associated with a 1SD increase in sICAM-1 levels at baseline were 1.67 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.05) for SBI progression and 2.17 (95% CI 1.29 to 3.62) for PVWML progression at 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, baseline hs-CRP levels were significantly associated with SBI progression only at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant trends were observed between quartiles of sICAM-1 at baseline and scores in Digit Symbol substitution (p for trend=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that higher sICAM-1 levels are associated with SBI and PVWML progression, and may predict impairment in psychomotor function in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
