<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate after left subclavian arterial port-catheter placement was compared in two groups: one with minimal redundancy of the catheter and one with pronounced redundancy in the aortic arch designed to minimize the likelihood of catheter dislocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-eight patients (102 men, 46 women; age range, 26-83 years; mean age, 64.3 years) with inoperable advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancers</z:hpo> underwent percutaneous implantation of port-catheter systems via the left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 33 patients, a pronounced redundancy of the catheter was intentionally looped in the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Redundancy was intentionally avoided in the remaining 115 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> complications in these two groups were retrospectively compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 33 patients with pronounced redundant catheter looping, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> occurred in four cases (12.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> occurred in only three of the 115 patients with minimal redundant catheter looping (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> complications was significantly higher in the patients with pronounced redundant catheter looping in the aortic arch than in patients with minimal pronounced redundant catheter looping (P = .044, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Catheter redundancy in the aortic arch increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients undergoing implantation of port-catheter systems via a left subclavian arterial approach for repeated hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
