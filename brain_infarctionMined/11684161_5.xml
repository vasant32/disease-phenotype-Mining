<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751421" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemispatial neglect</z:e> (and two control groups) were tested to examine the effects of lateralized cues on line bisection and Landmark judgements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experiment was designed to investigate whether bisection and landmark biases induced by cueing are simply a result of a direct perceptual lengthening of the cued part of the line caused by the fact that the cue is visible, thus creating a composite 'line plus cue' or whether cueing indeed induces an attentional bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondly, earlier work by Harvey et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751421" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemispatial neglect</z:e> using the landmark task, Brain and Cognition 1995; 27: 59-78] has shown that in neglect patients cues work by inducing orientational biases rather than via the alteration of subjective length perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An attempt was made to replicate this finding and extend it to cues that are not physically present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bisection data clearly showed that cues bias attention rather than work via a direct lengthening of the line: both visible and invisible cues biased bisection performance equally well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Landmark data, however, revealed much less clear-cut results and we failed to repeat the earlier observation by Harvey et al. that cues induce orientational biases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even when the neglect patients were categorised into premotor and perceptual categories a clear effect failed to emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesised that the earlier reported effect may be linked to neglect severity rather than to perceptual type neglect </plain></SENT>
