<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated knowledge of RF and WS and the impact of an educational program by medical students </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We first surveyed individuals to determine knowledge of WS and RF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, after a 6-month education program, knowledge was reassessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire included sociodemographic and comorbidity data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Ï‡(2) and Mann-Whitney U test, as well as a multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine variables associated with knowledge, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We performed 329 baseline and 355 posteducation surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initially, 57.1% mentioned at least 1 RF; this later increased to 65.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mentions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemias</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With regard to WS, 37.6% mentioned at least 1, which increased to 48.1% who mentioned <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in 1 limb, in half the body, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and altered vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Educational level (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.42-4.53; P=0.001), employment (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.08-2.74; P=0.021), a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.35-4.11; P=0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.026-2.6; P=0.038), and having received information in the last 6 months (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.51-4.83; P=0.001) were associated with a better understanding of RF and WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The educational program was cost-effective and had a positive impact on knowledge of RF and WS of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More education programs are required to improve knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
