<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the neuropsychological functioning of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) and evaluated the significance of laterality in cognitive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with exclusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> as verified by clinical and neuroradiological findings underwent a neuropsychological assessment at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their performance was compared with 14 controls, also assessed twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The focus was on four domains: visuospatial/motor functions, episodic memory, working memory and attentional shifting/execution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups improved over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences emerged in tests in the visuomotor domain as well as in the episodic and working memory domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesion</z:e> were slow in a visuospatial task, whereas those with right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> had verbal memory difficulty compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By 3 months, 77% of the patients had returned to work, and only one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and did not return to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may result in subtle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> perhaps primarily related to working <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The symptoms may be mediated by the contralateral cortical hemisphere, left cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> producing mild right hemispheral dysfunction and right cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> producing mild left hemispheral dysfunction </plain></SENT>
