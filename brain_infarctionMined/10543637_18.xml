<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evolution and limitations of diffusion-weighted imaging findings in newborns, however, have not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using line-scan diffusion imaging (LSDI), we investigated perinatal ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen term newborns (age, 9 hours to 8 days; mean age, 2.6 days) with perinatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> were evaluated using LSDI (1520/62.5/1 [TR/TE/excitations]) (b maximum = 750 s/mm2) and T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (conventional) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examinations were performed in seven patients and autopsy in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) were measured in deep gray matter, white matter, the cortex, and focal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging or pathologic findings, patients were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 1 (n = 12) had symmetric/diffuse injury consistent with global hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (n = 7) had focal/multifocal injury suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> were abnormal at initial examination in 10 newborns in group 1 and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newborns in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of LSDI were abnormal before conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed in three newborns in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> were maximally decreased between days 1 and 3 in deep gray matter, perirolandic white matter, and focal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Delayed decreases in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> were observed in subcortical white matter from days 4 through 10 in three patients in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After global hypoperfusion, LSDI showed deep gray matter and perirolandic white matter lesions before conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LSDI may underestimate the extent of injury, however, possibly because of variations in the compartmentalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, selective vulnerability, and delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Differences in LSDI of symmetric/diffuse and focal/multifocal lesions may reflect differences in pathophysiology or timing of the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> interventions </plain></SENT>
