<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive adult patients admitted in the period 2000-2003 with SAH, Hunt-Hess grade I-IV, indicated for neurosurgical intervention, were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative period they were treated with mechanical ventilation and triple H protocol with nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subarachnoid preventive SNP was administred in initial dose of 1 mg by catheter inserted into basal cisterns during the neurosurgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The timing of following dosage was directed by the changes of respiratory parameters of brain tissue in the region of interest by multiparameter sensor (Codman Neurotrend) and findings of blood flow velocity on the level of circle of Willis were measured by transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 17 patients were enrolled to study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase blood flow velocity was found in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preventive subarachnoid use of SNP in combination with multimodal monitoring might be a possible preventive strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its efficacy has to be proved on a greater group of patients in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The therapeutical use of SNP requires an increase in application rate </plain></SENT>
