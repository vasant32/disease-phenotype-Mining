<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was questioned if and to what degree dCA was changed after ACZ infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 15 mg kg(-1) ACZ infusion cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was assessed in 29 first ever lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (19 M/10 F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the CVR-test, the electrocardiogram, non-invasive finger arterial blood pressure (ABP) and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (CBFV) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DCA based on spontaneous blood pressure variations was evaluated in 24 subjects by linear transfer function analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Squared coherence, gain and phase angle in the frequency range of autoregulation (0.04-0.16 Hz) were compared before and after ACZ infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After ACZ infusion, median phase angle decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.005 Wilcoxon) to 0.77 rad compared to a pre-test baseline value of 1.05 rad, indicating less efficient dCA due to ACZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, post-test phase values are still mostly within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor and statistically non-significant correlations were found between CVR and absolute dCA phase angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that CVR testing with body weight adjusted infusion of ACZ lowers dCA performance but by no means exhausts dCA, suggesting that in this way maximal CVR is not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Characterizing dCA based on transfer function analysis of ABP to CBFV needs no provocation and adverse patient effects are minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The poor correlation between CVR and dCA phase angle supports an interpretation that CVR and dCA study different mechanisms of cerebrovascular control </plain></SENT>
