<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Retardation in this field has been causing serious medical and socioeconomic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN PURPOSE AND STARTING POINTS (OBJECTIVES): In spite of existing unfavourable conditions the authors of this paper have managed to standardize their own policy in diagnosis, surgical indications and techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This caused substantial improvement of their results, as well as cooperation with the neurologic clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In connection with the increasing numbers of operations and improved results, the authors report their recent experience in this field and compare them with the results from previous years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors compare two series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first series of 65 consecutive patients surgically treated from 1st Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1987 to 31st Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1990 (69 operations altogether) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2nd series of 169 consecutive patients surgically treated from January 1st 1993 to December 31st 1994 (191 operations altogether), 149 due of them were subjected to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the first series was 55.3 (35-73), 2nd series 59.7 years (42-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors have studied participation of neurologically and angiographically unstable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the first series the ratio of neurologically stable and unstable patients was 63.4:36.6%, while in the 2nd series it was 75.4:24.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ratio of angiographically stable and unstable patients was in the 1st series 60.2:39.8%, while in the 2nd series it was 50.3:49.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the 2nd series the authors observed also the percent age of ulcerated lesions in the carotid bifurcation and found a surprisingly high number-59.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combined mortality-morbidity index of the first series was 11.6%, of the 2nd series 3.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the first series there were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (2.9%) and 6 brain infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the 2nd series four patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (2.1%) and there were two cases of a perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The necessity of wound revision due to of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was found in two patients (2.9%) in the first series, and in two cases (1%) in the 2nd series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors emphasize the complicated nature of these problems, the necessity to recognize the surgical indications and techniques, and protective measures to prevent serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There is, in their opinion, inevitable to increase bringing the patients in need of surgical reconstruction under control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there is the necessity to increase the accessibility of qualified surgery in the CVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>That means in the first place to increase the number of centers able to accomplish these operations with minimal combined mortality-morbidity index </plain></SENT>
