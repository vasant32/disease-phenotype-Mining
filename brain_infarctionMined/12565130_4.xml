<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hGLUT5 was not expressed in most peripheral macrophages in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state, but weakly expressed in some foamy macrophages in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no hGLUT5 reactivity in blood monocytes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study indicated that unlike other microglial markers, hGLUT5 is rarely present in peripheral macrophages, and that hGLUT5 immunohistochemistry is useful in distinguishing microglia-derived macrophages from monocyte-derived macrophages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> necrotic lesions </plain></SENT>
