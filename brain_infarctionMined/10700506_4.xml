<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MRI studies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> often reveal ill-defined hyperintensity in the pons on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pontine hyperintensity (PHI) does not fulfill the criteria of a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and its clinical relevance is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the frequency, as well as the radiological and clinical correlates, of PHI in poststroke patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred nineteen patients were studied 3 months after supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with the use of 1.0-T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, white matter hyperintensities, and PHI were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was assessed 3 and 15 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients, 152 (47.6%) had PHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> did not differ in patients without or with PHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PHI was related to a higher frequency (P=0.002) and larger volume (P&lt;0.001) of supratentorial brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, to parietal (P=0.020) and temporal (P=0.002) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, to central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (P&lt; or =0.040), and to white matter hyperintensity grade (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that affected the corpus striatum (putamen, caudate, and pallidum) (P&lt; or =0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>011) or pyramidal tract (P&lt;0.001) were more frequent in patients with PHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 3- and 15-month outcomes were worse in patients with PHI (P&lt; or =0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The total volume of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR 1.22), mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (OR 3.59), and PHI (OR 3.76) were independent correlates of a poor 15-month outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PHI after supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> deserves attention because it relates to poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
