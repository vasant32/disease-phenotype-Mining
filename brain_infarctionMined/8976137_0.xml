<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> in his right face and right thumb and index finger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His cranial magnetic resonance imaging disclosed that the infarction was located in the left precentral sulcus and at the base of the central sulcus, while the left postcentral gyrus was not involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His sensory symptom was attributed to the lesion of the Brodmann's area 3a, which is located at the base of the central sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the lesions responsible for cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cheiro-oral syndrome</z:e> are dispersed more widely than those for thalamic or pontine ones, since the somatotopy of face and hand in the cortex is distributed more extensively than that in the thalamus or pons </plain></SENT>
