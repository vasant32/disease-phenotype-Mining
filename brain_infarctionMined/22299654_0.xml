<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were usually excluded from thrombolytic treatment in clinical trials and clinical practice, and little is known about effectiveness of thrombolysis treatment in such patients who may end up with severe disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS OF THE STUDY: We aimed to describe the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients presenting with isolated homonymous hemianopia and treated with intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case report of three patients presenting with homonymous hemianopia owing to posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with intravenous thrombolysis at the Helsinki University Central Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were modified Rankin Scale and neuropsychological examination at 3 months after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further evaluated Goldmann visual field examination at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> findings appeared on admission non-contrast head-computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a perfusion deficit on admission-computed tomography perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients scored 0 on 3-month modified Rankin Scale, and their neuropsychological evaluation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Goldmann examination revealed no visual field deficit in both female patients, and a modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> was detected in the male patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experience encourages application of intravenous thrombolytic treatment (especially when supported with multimodality neuroimaging) in patients with homonymous hemianopia, for which rehabilitation options are limited </plain></SENT>
