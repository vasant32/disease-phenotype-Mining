<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>H2O15-PET was performed during caloric vestibular stimulation of the right and left external ears in eight right-handed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral infarctions or haemorrhages of the posterolateral thalamus (four right, four left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The posterolateral thalamus is the relay station for ipsi- and contralateral ascending vestibular input to the multiple multisensory vestibular cortex areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of unilateral vestibular thalamic lesions on thalamo-cortical projections, right hemispheric dominance and reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction, as well as perceptual and ocular motor consequences during caloric irrigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major findings of the group analyses of the patients with right-sided and those with left-sided lesions were as follows: (i) activation of the multisensory vestibular temporo-parietal cortex was significantly reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion when the ipsilesional or contralesional ear was stimulated; (ii) activation of multisensory vestibular cortex areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the irrigated ipsilesional ear was also diminished; and (iii) the right hemispheric dominance in right-handers described above was preserved in those with right and left thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous deactivations were often restricted to only one hemisphere--the one contralateral to the stimulation and contralateral to the vestibular cortex areas activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was, however, one area in the inferior insula which was also activated by either right or left ear stimulation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This supports the assumption that there is a bilateral direct ascending vestibular projection from the vestibular nuclei to the inferior part of the insula, which bypasses the posterolateral thalamus and is stronger in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cortical asymmetry of the pattern of activation during horizontal semicircular canal stimulation by calorics was not associated with a significant direction-specific asymmetry of caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> or perceived body motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a unique relay station for vestibular input to the cortex, of the dominance of the right hemisphere in right-handedness, and of ipsilateral ascending pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> interaction between the two sensory systems--the vestibular and the visual--appears to be impaired </plain></SENT>
