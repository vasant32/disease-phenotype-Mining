<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pathogenesis of cerebral small-vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) is incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> has been implicated and may result in increased blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability with leakage of blood constituents into the vessel wall and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used contrast-enhanced MRI to determine whether there was any evidence for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability in the white matter of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, and whether this was present not only in areas of leucoaraiosis (white-matter lesions) but also in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing white matter (NAWM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects underwent T1 volumetric MRI before and after bolus injection of contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scanning was continued for 30 min postinjection to determine the contrast-enhancement time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean signal intensity change was plotted against time to calculate the area under the curve values, a parameter related to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automated brain segmentation and regions of interest analysis were performed to determine 'permeability' in different brain compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls (n=15), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> patient group (n=24) had signal changes consistent with increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability in NAWM (p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analyses identified leucoaraiosis grade as an independent predictor of these permeability related signal changes in NAWM after adjustment for age, gender, weight, brain volume, area under the curve in the internal carotid arteries and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, and this is particularly seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> with leucoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its presence in NAWM would be consistent with it playing a causal role in disease pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
