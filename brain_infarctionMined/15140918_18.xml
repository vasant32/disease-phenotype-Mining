<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently characterized an in vivo rat model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> and here sought to evaluate potential pharmacological treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalographic activity was recorded continuously for 24 h in freely behaving rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug from one of seven different drug classes at ED(50) and 2x ED(50) doses (as reported in other rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> models), delivered as a single i.v. injection 20 min post-MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vehicle-treated rats (n = 9) had an 89% incidence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> with an average number of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> of 8.6 +/- 1.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latency to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> was 32.5 +/- 3.4 min post-MCAo with an average duration of 49.1 +/- 8.2 s/event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high doses of ethosuximide, gabapentin, fos-phenytoin, and valproate significantly reduced the incidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi>(11, 14, 14, and 38%, respectively), whereas midazolam, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4470">dextromethorphan</z:chebi> had no significant effect at either dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Across treatment groups, there was a low but significant correlation between the number of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> events per animal and volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (r = 0.352) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on combined effects on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, infarction, neurological recovery, and mortality, ethosuximide and gabapentin were identified as having the best therapeutic profile </plain></SENT>
