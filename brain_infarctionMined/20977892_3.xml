<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the neurorestorative mechanisms by which MSCs improve neurological functional recovery are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endogenous cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is well known, but most of newly formed cells underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that neurotrophic factors secreted by human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBMSCs) promote endogenous neurogenesis, reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and improve functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult rats subjected to 2-h middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) were transplanted with hBMSCs or saline into the ipsilateral brain parenchyma at 3days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant recovery of behavior in the hBMSCs-treated rats beginning at 14days after MCAO compared with the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected in the hBMSCs-treated rat brain than the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human BMSCs treatment also enhanced endogenous cell proliferation both in the SVZ and in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, more neuronal progenitor cells migrated from the SVZ to the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) and differentiated into mature neurons with less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in rats treated with hBMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data suggest an essential role for hBMSCs in promoting endogenous neurogenesis, protecting newly formed cells, and improving functional recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
