<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of the stable metabolites of these two compounds, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>, were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 14 patients with no evidence of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> ranged from 0.15 to 4.0 pg/ml and were significantly higher (P = 0.025) in the ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group when compared with the control group (0.1-0.3 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously acquired concentrations of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> were not elevated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
