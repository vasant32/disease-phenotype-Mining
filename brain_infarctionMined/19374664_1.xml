<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the intrathecal levels of cytokines in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 32 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (including 29 age- and gender-matched subjects) who received operations with spinal anesthesia were studied prospectively and underwent measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-1beta and IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After an age- and gender-matched analysis of 58 patients (29 pairs), the mean intrathecal levels of IL-1beta were 0.80 pg/ml in patients with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 0.59 pg/ml in non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mean CSF levels of IL-6 were 21.54 pg/ml and 7.52 pg/ml in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and control groups, respectively (P = 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent with the data without matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CSF levels of IL-1beta in the 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were significantly higher than in the 32 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, but not IL-6, remained elevated in the CSF of patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
