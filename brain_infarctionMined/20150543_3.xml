<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies have evaluated the long-term health impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as categorized into different subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to quantify the loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The hospital-based cohort, which consisted of 13,194 patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> dates between 1995 and 2007, was classified into lacunar and nonlacunar infarctions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After linking with the National Mortality Registry, survival functions were determined and extrapolated over a 50-year period based on the survival ratio between the patients' survival and age- and sex-matched reference population's as calculated from the vital statistics of Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survival functions were then multiplied by the quality of life assessed under the EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire based on a sample of 486 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life expectancy for a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was 8.7 quality-adjusted life-years with an average loss of 8.3 quality-adjusted life-years, and there appeared to be no difference between lacunar and nonlacunar infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> had a similar quality-adjusted life expectancy as those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> but with a significantly greater loss relative to the reference population (14.1 quality-adjusted life-years) because of younger ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lifelong health burden due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was approximately 9.5 quality-adjusted life-years and should be considered in future cost-effectiveness analyses for prevention </plain></SENT>
