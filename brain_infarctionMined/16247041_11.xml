<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of major neurologic improvement at 24 hours after IV rt-PA administration and its relationship with outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with IV rt-PA from two academic centers in London, Ontario, and 33 affiliated hospitals between 1999 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major neurologic improvement was defined by a &gt; or = 8-point improvement in NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score or an NIHSS score of 0 or 1 at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was defined as a 3-month modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 219 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with rt-PA, 61 (28%) had major neurologic improvement at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> levels &lt; 8 mmol/L (OR 4.98, 95% CI 1.6 to 15.2), lack of cortical involvement on 24 hour CT scan (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.87 to 8.43), and female sex (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.13) were associated with major neurologic improvement after adjusting for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with major neurologic improvement had a shorter hospital stay (6.7 vs 14.3 days; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major neurologic improvement was an independent predictor of good outcome at 3 months (OR 12.8, 95% CI 4.72 to 34.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Major neurologic improvement after rt-PA was observed in 28% of patients and independently predicted good outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Female sex, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels &lt; 8 mmol/L, and absence of cortical involvement at 24 hours CT scan were associated with major neurologic improvement </plain></SENT>
