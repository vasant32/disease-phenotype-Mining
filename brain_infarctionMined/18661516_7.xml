<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The level of anticoagulation at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> may influence the size, composition, and dissolution rate of the occlusive clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the relation between admission international normalized ratio (INR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 93 consecutive patients with preadmission <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use who had INR measurement and diffusion-weighted imaging performed within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three etiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype-matched patients without prior <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use served as control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis was used to test for independence of INR as a predictor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with preadmission <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use, admission INR was inversely correlated with lesion volume on diffusion-weighted imaging (r = -0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This relation was retained after adjustment for potential covariates (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INR less than 2.0 was associated with 3.5-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.9-4.2) greater lesion volume on diffusion-weighted imaging as compared with INR of 2.0 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who were on therapeutic INR (&gt;or=2.0) had smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with patients without preadmission <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Admission INR was inversely correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> perfusion defect (r = -0.33), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = -0.42), National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at admission (r = -0.27), and modified Rankin score at discharge (r = -0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that preadmission <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use associated with therapeutic level of anticoagulation can offer a benefit in limiting the extent of ischemic injury in an event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
