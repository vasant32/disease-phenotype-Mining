<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the same model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in rats we now report the neuroprotective effects of CGX-1007 when delivered intrathecally (i.t.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When given 4 h post-occlusion, a reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was measured along with significant neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we describe an i.t. neuroprotective therapeutic window lasting &gt; or = 8 h from the start of the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Critically, this is the first comprehensive report of a neuroprotective agent that can be administered i.t. to ameliorate experimental brain injury and potentially provide an excellent therapeutic window as a neuroprotection treatment </plain></SENT>
