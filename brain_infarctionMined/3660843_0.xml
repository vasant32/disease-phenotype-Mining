<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> levels were elevated at both measurement times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> infarction was characterized by significant correspondence of serum and CSF concentrations for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and alpha-oxo-beta-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17418">valeric acid</z:chebi> which was lost during the recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amino acids of the L-system were roughly doubled (phenylalanine 7-fold in the CSF); increased concentrations were recorded for amino acids of the basic transport system, while amino acids of the A-system stayed unchanged (with the exception of alpha-amino <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30772">butyric acid</z:chebi>--20-fold in CSF) </plain></SENT>
