<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the effects of the use-dependent <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blocker RS100642, an analog of mexiletine, as a neuroprotectant and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> agent in a rat model of transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-injury treatment with RS100642 (0.01-5.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, improved functional recovery of electroencephalographic (EEG) power, and improved neurological outcome following 2 h of MCAo and 24 h recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was more potent and offered a larger reduction of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume than a maximal neuroprotective dose of mexiletine (10.0 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity recorded following 1 h MCAo and 72 h of recovery in injured rats was either completely blocked (30 min pre-MCAo treatment) or significantly reduced (30 min post-MCAo treatment) with RS100642 (1.0 mg/kg) treatment resulting in greater than 60% reduction of core brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity during MCAo likely contributes to the pathophysiology of brain injury and that RS100642 may be an effective neuroprotective treatment not only to decrease brain injury but also to reduce the pathological EEG associated with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
