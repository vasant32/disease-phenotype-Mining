<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cannabinoids confer neuroprotection in several experimental paradigms, but the responsible mechanisms remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to examine whether the synthetic CB1 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> HU-210 is capable of reducing ischemic damage and to determine the mechanisms responsible for such protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After dose-response and therapeutic time window-finding experiments, the rats were injected with HU-210 (45 microg/kg IV) or vehicle 1 hour after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters and cerebral blood flow in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were examined with a motor disability scale, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured 72 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effects of the selective CB1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR-141716 and of controlled warming on the neuroprotection conferred by HU-210 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HU-210 <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp> and heart rate but did not alter the cerebral blood flow in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Motor disability and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were significantly reduced (by up to 77%; P&lt;0.05) in animals treated with HU-210 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single injection of HU-210 significantly lowered the body temperature compared with vehicle as measured both at 1 hour (32.3+/-1.3 degrees C versus 35+/-1.6 degrees C; P=0.0024) and at 24 hours (31.5+/-2.5 degrees C versus 37.25+/-0.3 degrees C; P=0.0031) after PMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of HU-210 were partially reversed by pretreatment with SR-141716 but were completely abolished by warming of the animals to the levels observed in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HU-210 confers robust protection against ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This protection is mediated at least in part by binding to CB1 receptors and is also associated with the indirect protective effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
