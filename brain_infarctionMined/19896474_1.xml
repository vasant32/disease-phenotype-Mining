<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was applied here to examine sequential changes of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral venous infarction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka, LETO) and diabetic (Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty, OLETF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine and compare the ischemic pathogenesis related to regional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) induced with 2VO in diabetic OLETF and non-diabetic LETO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cortical veins were occluded photochemically by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> dye in 10 OLETF and 10 LETO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were killed with perfusion fixation at 48 h after 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bax and Bcl-2 staining was performed along with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transderase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay to examine the relationship to single-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle actin and Van Gieson's elastic staining were done for assessment of thickening of the vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Not only the volume of cerebral cortex affected by 2VO-induced venous infarction was increased in diabetic OLETF rats, but we also observed significantly reduced CBF at 90 min after 2VO, coupled with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in and around ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, OLETF rats demonstrated marked thickening of the walls in the small cerebral vessels with perivascular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, indicating more severe cerebral microvascular atherosclerotic changes as compared to their non-diabetic LETO counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The OLETF rat thus appears to be an excellent animal model for studying the diabetic enhancement of venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by 2VO </plain></SENT>
