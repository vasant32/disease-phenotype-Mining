<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain "softenings" were distinguished from hemorrhagic "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e>," but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology remained unstudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The terms artherosclerosis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, embolism, and lacune were introduced to indicate etiology, but carotid occlusive disease was recognized later, in the second half of the 19th century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development of knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was slow, likely corresponding to limited interest by the great early neurologists: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> never was a field of critical interest in the Salpêtrière and Pitié Schools at the time of the local leading figures, Vulpian and Charcot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, scarce studies were due to isolated physicians, who did not contribute much to other fields, including Rochoux, Rostan, Durand-Fardel, or Dechambre; critical advances came from pathologists such as Rokitansky and Virchow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among neurologists generally was clearly triggered by the development of clinical-topographic correlation studies, promoted by Déjerine and Marie, and followed by Foix, the father of modern clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
