<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate: 1) alternative causes of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> other than small-vessel disease; 2) functional outcome of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> due to small vessel disease compared to lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> due to alternative causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with first-ever ischemic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively followed-up for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At discharge patients were divided into 2 groups: lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to small vessel disease (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to possible other etiologies (L-non <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) (e. g. cardioembolism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or other causes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability (mRS &gt;or= 3) and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 535 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were seen during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of these, 196 patients (126 males) with a mean age of 71.6 years (SD = 10) had lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> was seen in 142 patients (72.4 %) and L-nonSVD in 54 patients (27.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 16.4 months, 12 patients had died (6.2%; annual mortality rate 4.4 %), 63 were disabled (32.5 %) and 27 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (13.9%; annual recurrence rate 9.9 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (34.7 %) and 26 with L-nonSVD (49%) had died or become disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (11.3 %) and 11 with L-nonSVD (20.4 %) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, L-nonSVD (OR = 2.87, 95% CI 1.08-7.65; p = 0.034) and age (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI 1.02-1.12; p = 0.01) were associated to more severe outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>L-nonSVD was independently associated with recurrence (OR = 5.03, 95% CI 1.54-16.44; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven percent of patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have causes other than small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These patients have a severe outcome in terms of recurrence,mortality or disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings support the need for a comprehensive diagnostic work-up for patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
