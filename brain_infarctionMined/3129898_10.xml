<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cellular events occurring in ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of 1 day to 8 weeks duration were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The material consisted of 17 human postmortem brains with anemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using antiserum against human plasma albumin as a marker for the breakdown of blood-brain barrier and ammoniacal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32130">silver nitrate</z:chebi> stain to demonstrate the vasculature, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and distribution of the extravasated plasma protein was compared with histological changes in the blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was observed that extravasation occurred in several separate regions of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> during different time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first few days, plasma proteins exudated from the vessels located at the marginal zone surrounding the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was followed by a prolonged phase of intense extravasation that coincided with the production of new capillaries originating from the blood vessels at the margin of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and from pial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that the actively proliferative and migratory activities of the endothelial cells and pericytes in the neovasculature may be responsible for the extravasation which is reflected in the contrast enhancement of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> observed clinically during the recovery phase </plain></SENT>
