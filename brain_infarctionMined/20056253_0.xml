<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that the formation of these wedge-shaped lesions may be related to the pattern of venous drainage in the ventral medulla and raised venous pressure due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrospinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> which has recently been described in MS </plain></SENT>
