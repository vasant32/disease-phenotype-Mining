<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">Tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (TBM) is a massive global problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality and morbidity associated with the severe form of the disease are exceptionally high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> is treated and full conventional therapy is commenced, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> can develop and is associated with a particularly poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate our experience with two patients with severe TBM and cerebral oxygenation monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Red Cross Children's Hospital, Cape Town </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patients with TBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Targeted interventions against low cerebral oxygenation in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cerebral tissue oxygenation (Ptio2) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both patients, Ptio2 monitoring demonstrated delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> despite the institution of full conventional therapy and the control of intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data confirm that the vascular involvement in TBM is potentially progressive and that failure to diagnose infarction initially is not merely due to a delay in the radiologic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The first patient developed extensive infarction, consistent with Ptio2 readings, and subsequently died after treatment withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intervention in the second patient successfully reversed a precipitous decline of the Ptio2 readings and may have prevented infarction in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The development of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in TBM despite treatment is confirmed in these two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The reversal of a decline in Ptio2 readings suggests a possible benefit for cerebral oxygenation monitoring in selected patients with severe TBM </plain></SENT>
