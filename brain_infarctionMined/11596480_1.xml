<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported (1) the neuroprotective effect against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> under normothermic condition, and (2) the hypothermic effect of the novel compound of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> 1 A <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, SUN N4057 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present investigation was designed to examine the enhancement of the neuroprotective effect by its pharmacological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 24 anesthetized cats(body weight 1.9-4.6 kg), the left middle cerebral artery(<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion was performed via the transorbital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Just after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, SUN N4057(6 micrograms/kg/min) was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters were measured continuously, and arterial blood gas was analyzed hourly for 6 hours and maintained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly allocated to the following three groups: (1) ischemic controls infused with <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> saline(Group A, n = 8), (2) SUN N4057 under normothermic condition(Group B, n = 8), (3) SUN N4057 (Group C, n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, brain coronal sections of 3 mm in thickness were stained with 1% triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>(TTC) solution, and hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were calculated by using a computerized image analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in any physiological parameters among 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Group C, brain temperature decreased significantly starting 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and dropped by 2.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C 5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 35.6 +/- 6.9% (Group A), 23.3 +/- 5.8% (Group B) and 12.3 +/- 11.3% (Group C), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences among three groups(p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of these data, we conclude that SUN N4057 provides more effective neuroprotection by the combination of hypothermic and neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Chemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> may lead to a new therapeutic approaches for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
