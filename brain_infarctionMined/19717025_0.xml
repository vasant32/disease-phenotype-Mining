<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A robust circle of Willis has been recognized for its major protective function in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When it became possible to actually create new collateral circulation to the brain by microsurgical techniques, significant enthusiasm arose </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the trial raised serious questions regarding incomplete randomization by contributors to the study, and there remains uncertainty about important potential benefits for some individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up of 3 patients having different and complex circumstances is described to emphasize this concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the creation of reliable collateral circulation to the brain, none has experienced new ischemic deficit during the subsequent follow-up of 27, 25, and 12 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
