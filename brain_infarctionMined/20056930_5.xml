<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlarged perivascular spaces in the brain are common but generally overlooked and of uncertain pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may reflect underlying cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined whether enlarged perivascular spaces were associated with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and white matter hyperintensities, markers of established small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lacunar or cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-matched nonstroke control subjects were also recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We rated basal ganglia and centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces 0 to 4 (0=none, 4=&gt;40) on T2-weighted MRI and white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared enlarged perivascular spaces between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and control subjects and assessed associations with vascular risk factors and white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recruited 350 patients; 129 lacunar, 124 cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 97 age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for vascular risk factors and white matter hyperintensities, total enlarged perivascular spaces were associated with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype (P=0.04) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group (n=253); basal ganglia enlarged perivascular spaces were associated with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype (P=0.003), deep (P=0.02) and periventricular white matter hyperintensities (P=0.01); in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 350 subjects, total enlarged perivascular spaces were associated with deep (P&lt;0.001) and periventricular (P&lt;0.001) white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although prevalent in patients with vascular risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, enlarged perivascular spaces are specifically associated with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies should determine the mechanism of this association while including adequate controls to account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Enlarged perivascular spaces should not be overlooked in studies of small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
