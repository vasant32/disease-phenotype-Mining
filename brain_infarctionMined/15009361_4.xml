<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report our experience with Gas-less laparoscopy-assisted surgery (Gas-less LAS), hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) and pure laparoscopic surgery (LS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal carcinoma</z:hpo> and compare the characteristics and usefulness of these methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen, 14 and 16 patients were subjected to Gas-less LAS, HALS and LS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study started with Gas-less LAS and then gradually shifted to HALS and LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the operative and postoperative parameters for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The learning curve effect was evaluated based on data from the first 10 cases of each group, which were operated on by the same surgeon and operation team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The learning curve of operation times in the LS group demonstrated that the operation time for this procedure is acceptable even in early-stage cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in mean operative time between the three surgical groups, excluding the conversion cases, were not statistically significant; however, there was a significant difference in blood loss volume between the groups (P &lt;/= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operation time tended to be shorter in Gas-less LAS and the frequency of parental <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> administration tended to be reduced in the LS group when compared to the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the total 47 patients treated, two cases were converted to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major postoperative complication was one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the HALS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient in the LS group developed a lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> 11 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As minimally invasive operative techniques, these three methods do not differ significantly in terms of surgical outcome; however, LS tended to be slightly superior in terms of postoperative pain control and cosmetic appearance </plain></SENT>
