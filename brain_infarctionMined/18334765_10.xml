<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Aging is associated with a temporally dysregulated cellular response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as poor functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While environmental enrichment has been shown to improve the behavioral outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young animals, the effect of an enriched environment on behavioral and neuropathological recovery in aged animals is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by electrocoagulation of the right middle cerebral artery in 3 month- and 20 month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was assessed in neurobehavioral tests conducted over a period of 28 days following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue was then immunostained for proliferating astrocytes and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and scar tissue volumes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aged rats showed more severe behavioral impairments and diminished functional recovery compared to young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most infarcted animals had disturbances of sensorimotor function, with recovery beginning later, progressing more slowly, and reaching a lower functional endpoint in aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the enriched environment significantly improved the rate and extent of recovery in aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis revealed that the beneficial effect of the enriched environment on recovery, both in young and aged rats, correlated highly with a reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, in the number of proliferating astrocytes, and in the volume of the glial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that temporally modulating astrocytic proliferation and the ensuing scar formation might be a fruitful approach to improving functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in aged rats </plain></SENT>
