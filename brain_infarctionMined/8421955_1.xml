<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies we have shown that one of the factors, which influence evolution of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is microthrombosis in the area of infarction and in the surrounding brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken for assessment of the number of microthrombi and of the size of brain infarcting in rats treated with the antiaggregatory substance Triflusal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>7 groups of Sprague-Dawley rats, each group consisting of 6 animals, underwent transsphenoidal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals received Triflusal in various amounts from day 2 till day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At day 7 animals were decapitated and the brains were fixed in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain was dissected at the level of the optic chiasm and embedded in paraffin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fresh microthrombi were detected py PTAH (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53394">Phosphotungstic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each animal the hemisphere with the ischemic lesion as well as the contralateral hemisphere were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area of both hemispheres was calculated by subtraction of the ventricle area from the total brain area of a section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> was defined as the region of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> which was sharply demarcated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The infarcted area was planimetrically measured to obtain a ratio of infarcted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A correlation between the effect of Triflusal, number of microthrombi and size of the infarcted area could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic role of the microthrombi in the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> as well as the effect of Triflusal in different dosages on the number of microthrombi could be clearly assessed by quantitative morphometry </plain></SENT>
