<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors that induce these changes and the dynamic interaction among cells in the environs of the injured brain remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present rat brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> model, we studied the spatiotemporal relationship between basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) expression and cell proliferation using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an S-phase marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated an early astrocytic and neuronal activation with enhanced expression of bFGF in areas adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was followed by a period from 3-5 days of intense cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeled nuclei were demonstrated in perineuronal satellite cells, endothelial cells, vascular pericytes, macrophages and glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells appeared to respond to the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>(s) and they produced bFGF during the proliferative phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a simultaneous spreading of neuronal activation and glial proliferation from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to the entire ipsilateral hemisphere and through the coronal radiations to the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This spreading follows the pattern of spreading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that cell proliferation in the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may be induced by bFGF released by neurons and sustained by bFGF and other growth factors produced by non-neural cells on an autocrine basis </plain></SENT>
