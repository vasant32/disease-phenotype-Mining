<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of these studies were threefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Firstly, to further characterize the effect of perforant path transection on a test of short-term memory: delayed matching (or nonmatching)-to-position [D(N)MTP] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondly, to evaluate the effect of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917805,C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in the same task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both surgical procedures were chosen as they produce a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesion similar to that described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, the effect of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> (Aricept(R), E2020), on the resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perforant path transection produced a robust, delay-dependent impairment of choice accuracy in rats performing either a delayed matching- or nonmatching-to-position task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sample latency was also reduced following lesion, yet the lesion-induced impairment was not affected by increasing the response requirement at the sample stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An 11-min period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischaemia</z:e> (two-vessel occlusion model) resulted in almost complete loss of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and a delay-dependent impairment in DMTP performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, unlike perforant path lesions, this deficit was unstable and declined in magnitude over the experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing the delay interval restored this deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">Donepezil</z:chebi>, at doses that robustly attenuated a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi> (0.06 mg/kg s.c.)-induced DMTP accuracy impairment in na√Øve, unoperated rats, had no effect against either lesion-induced impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results are considered in terms of the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38462">acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> in noncholinergic-based preclinical cognitive models </plain></SENT>
