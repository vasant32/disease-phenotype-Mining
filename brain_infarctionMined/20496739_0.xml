<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specificity of the acupoints and related factors on acupuncture effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rat model of cerebral median <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was established with thread ligation according to Zea-Longa method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The acupoint group and the non-acupoint group were stimulated by acupuncture with 9 different parameters (marked group No. I - VI) combined by frequency (60 Hz, 120 Hz, 180 Hz) and time (5 s, 60 s, 180 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The acupoint of "shuigou" (GV 26) was selected for the acupoint group, the fixed point which was at a distance of 10 mm from the iliac crest below the ribs in the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The acupuncture effect was evaluated with the percentage of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area after TTC dyeing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Acupoint groups could obviously reduce the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> area in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under 9 intervention parameters, acupoint groups had much more effectiveness tendency than that of the non-acupoint groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) Acupoint group VI was the most effective in reducing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> area among 9 acupuncture parameter groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (1) Acupoint has specificity effect on reduction of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in MCAO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) Acupoint group VI (180 Hz; 5 s) could significantly reduce the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> area by TTC dyeing </plain></SENT>
