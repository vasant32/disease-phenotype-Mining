<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe occlusive lesions were found in &gt;1 large artery in 148 patients; 134 had unilateral or bilateral severe disease at one arterial location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single arterial site occlusive disease occurred most often in the ECVA (52 patients, 15 bilateral) followed by the ICVA (40 patients, 12 bilateral) and the BA (46 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the ICVAs and the BA was very common and some patients also had ECVA lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, and coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> were most prevalent in patients with extracranial disease while <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> were more common when occlusive lesions were only intracranial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial embolism was the most common mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in patients with ECVA and ICVA occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICVA occlusive lesions infrequently caused infarction limited to the proximal territory (medulla and posterior inferior cerebellum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BA lesions most often caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> limited to the middle posterior circulation territory (pons and anterior inferior cerebellum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Posterior cerebral artery occlusive lesions were predominantly embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Penetrating artery disease caused mostly pontine and thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was poorest in patients with BA disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The best prognosis surprisingly was in patients who had multiple arterial occlusive lesions; they often had position-sensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> during months or years </plain></SENT>
