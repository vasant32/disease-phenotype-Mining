<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In addition to the thrombolytic agents, mechanical devices are being used in intraarterial procedures in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intervention protocol and outcomes of intraarterial procedures performed in the Hospital Virgen del Roc√≠o in 2003-2004 are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results in each <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> site and case-control study of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), the placebo group in PROACT II study (Prolyse in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> II) as historic control group, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 32 procedures were performed: 18 MCA occlusions, 8 basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 6 intracranial carotid occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urokinase, abciximab and mechanical devices were used in 60%, 26% and 60% of the cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions: 60% of the cases improved in 24 hours (25% remained asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 25% controls remained independent versus 55% of the treated patients (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization and complete recanalization rates were 95 % and 45 %, respectively (18% and 2% in the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SICH) rate was 18% vs 4% in cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>: only one patient died and 57% of the remaining patients were independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid occlusions: no complete recanalization was achieved and only one patient was independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evolution time in SICH patients was longer (p=0.04), with increased international normalized ratio (INR) for thromboplastin time (p=0.06) and old ischemic lesions in brain CT scan (p=0.02) and they were more dependent at three months (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial procedures in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions achieve high rates of recanalization and better clinical outcomes than those described in isolated intraarterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcomes in basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were also excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the natural evolution of carotid occlusions was not modified </plain></SENT>
