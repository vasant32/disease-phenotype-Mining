<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EDFP has the potential to improve cerebral microcirculation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and ultimately to salvage penumbral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no evidence is available to show that EDFP can increase cerebra blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether EDFP could increase CBF by quantitative CBF measurements and documented the clinical effects of EDFP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EDFP was performed ten times in seven patients diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> caused by major artery occlusive lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also fulfilled one of the following entry criteria: 1) diffusion/perfusion mismatch demonstrated by MRI on admission; 2) a hemispheric syndrome, but only a small lesion on diffusion weighted MRI (&lt;25% of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory); or 3) progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were 1) contraindication of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or 2) spontaneous improvement of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to EDFP varied from 5 hr to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma viscosity was quickly lowered by EDFP without affecting RBC counts, Hb, or Hct in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) with 15-O labeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> measurements revealed a significant CBF increase from 36.4 +/- 8.3 ml/100 g/min to 40.7 +/- 6.8 ml/100 g/min in the affected hemisphere (P=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Definite CBF improvement was also demonstrated by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) in one of two patients who had severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this patient showed remarkable improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> immediately following EDFP (NIHSS score: 18 to 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, EDFP can increase CBF in ischemic brain tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further clinical studies should focus on the efficacy of EDFP on outcome of patients with this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
