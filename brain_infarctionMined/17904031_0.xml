<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the current status of BP control in hypertensive patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, investigating 413 hypertensive patients (age range, 19 to 93; mean age, 62 +/- 12 years) who visited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> clinic at Kyushu University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the clinical characteristics of these hypertensive patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (age range, 29-86; mean age, 66 +/- 12 years; n = 95) with those of patients without such a history (age range, 19-93; mean age, 61 +/- 12 years; n = 318) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinic BP was measured by physicians with a mercury sphygmomanometer, and the averaged BP determined at 2 occasions in 2002 was used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic BP was similar among the patients with and without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (134 +/- 15 vs 137 +/- 14 mm Hg; P = not significant), but diastolic BP was significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (76 +/- 10 vs 82 +/- 10 mm Hg; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When strict BP control was defined as &lt;130/85 mm Hg, the rate of strict BP control was higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (35.8% vs 19.8%; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> classes used was similar in the 2 groups (1.7 +/- 0.9 and 1.8 +/- 1.0, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> were the most frequently used drugs in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">Diuretics</z:chebi> and beta-blockers were prescribed less frequently to the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> than to those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BP levels were lower in the patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> than in those with lacunar and atherothrombotic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our outpatient clinic, BP levels were lower in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than in the patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which may reflect physicians' awareness of the importance of strict BP control in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, as has been suggested by several recent clinical intervention trials </plain></SENT>
