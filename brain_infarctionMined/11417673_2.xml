<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: At a minimum of 6 months after their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 16 single supratentorial lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SSLI) patients and 16 controls underwent neuropsychological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, neuropsychological testing was repeated to investigate the robustness and validity of the initial test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An SSLI can cause subtle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e>, which could explain the decrease in quality of life often observed in patients with these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is unclear at which stage after the occurrence of neurologic deficit possible neuropsychological impairment can be interpreted as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and at what moment neuropsychological testing can best be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients and controls were administered a specifically developed neuropsychological test battery that included 14 standardized tasks tapping the main cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in test-performances between the groups were analyzed by parametric statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At both examinations, similar abnormalities were found on five demanding neuropsychological tasks (language, concept shifting, abstraction, incidental memory, and verbal fluency), suggesting a generalized energetic deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This long-term follow-up study showed evidence of subtle neurocognitive deficits after the occurrence of an SSLI, which are robust after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e> may explain the decrease in quality of life that patients with an SSLI often experience </plain></SENT>
