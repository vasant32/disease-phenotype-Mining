<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a severe increase in ICP caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SDH or diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> or secondary to ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In certain situations, conventional measures may fail to control such a rapid increase in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The cases of 4 pediatric patients with cranial trauma with raised ICP, in whom hemicranial decompression was performed, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SDH with diffuse brain injury; in addition, 2 of them had associated massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of them survived and had a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In certain situations, pediatric patients with cranial trauma may be offered hemicranial decompression as a surgical option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These children may have a better long-term outcome despite massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
