<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old, right-handed man suffered from left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with upper limb dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT and MRI revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> of the entire right middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> recovered excellently and residual neurological deficits 6 years later were left hand <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>(grasping power 9 kg vs. 35 kg in the right) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002312'>clumsiness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional MRI was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During right(<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) hand grasping, activation was seen in the left sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During left(paretic) hand grasping, activation was seen in the left (ipsilateral) sensorimotor cortex, right parietal cortex, and bilateral supplementary motor areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Near infrared spectroscopic imaging showed similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During right hand grasping, left sensorimotor cortex was activated, and during left hand grasping, bilateral sensorimotor cortices were activated with ipsilateral predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor hand area evoked right hand movement and stimulation of a point near that area evoked ipsilateral left hand muscle movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the findings of the three techniques consistently suggest that the recovery of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> of this patient was promoted by motor cortical area reorganization including the ipsilateral motor cortex </plain></SENT>
