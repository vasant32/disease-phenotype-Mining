<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuromyelitis optica</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi>) is an inflammatory and necrotizing disease clinically characterized by selective involvement of the optic nerves and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been a long controversy as to whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> is a variant of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) or a distinct disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi>-specific antibody (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi>-IgG) was found in the sera from patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi>, and its target antigen was identified as aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channel protein, mainly expressed in astroglial foot processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the pathogenetic role of the AQP4 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did an immunohistopathological study on the distribution of AQP4, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP), activated complement C9neo and immunoglobulins in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100561'>spinal cord lesions</z:hpo> and medulla oblongata of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> (n = 12), MS (n = 6), brain and spinal infarction (n = 7) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding was that AQP4 immunoreactivity was lost in 60 out of a total of 67 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> lesions (90%), but not in MS plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extensive loss of AQP4 accompanied by decreased GFAP staining was evident, especially in the active perivascular lesions, where immunoglobulins and activated complements were deposited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in those <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> lesions, MBP-stained myelinated fibres were relatively preserved despite the loss of AQP4 and GFAP staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The areas surrounding the lesions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> had enhanced expression of AQP4 and GFAP, which reflected reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AQP4 immunoreactivity was well preserved and rather strongly stained in the demyelinating MS plaques, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were also stained for AQP4 from the very <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, AQP4 was diffusely expressed in the entire tissue sections, but the staining in the spinal cord was stronger in the central grey matter than in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that the immunoreactivities of AQP4 and GFAP were consistently lost from the early stage of the lesions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi>, notably in the perivascular regions with complement and immunoglobulin deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These features in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> were distinct from those of MS and infarction as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and suggest that astrocytic impairment associated with the loss of AQP4 and humoral immunity may be important in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
