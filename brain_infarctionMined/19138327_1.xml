<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Towards the end of the 20th century, the city of Dijon, France, had a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than that found in other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that genetic and environmental factors were responsible for this so-called French paradox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to evaluate recent changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence to determine whether or not the Dijon exception still exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The population-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry of Dijon ascertained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> from 2000 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated incidence to compare recent results with those obtained from a previous study period (1985-1999) and those of other population-based studies covering both the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2000 to 2006, 1205 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Crude and age-standardized incidence (to European and World population) rates were respectively 113, 107 and 72/100,000/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No change was observed between 1985-1999 and 2000-2006, whereas other studies reported declining incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Dijon remained lower than that found in similar studies, but the difference compared with results observed for the 20th century is shrinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the Dijon exception is decreasing, suggesting that it was rather an advance in prevention strategies that has diminished </plain></SENT>
