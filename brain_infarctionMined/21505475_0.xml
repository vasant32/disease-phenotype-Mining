<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of cilostazol on venous infarction produced by a photothrombotic two-vein occlusion (2VO) model in diabetic and control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow (CBF) between the occluded veins was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry for 4 hours after 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size and immunohistochemistry were evaluated 24, 48, 96, and 168 hours after 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol was administered 1 hour after 2VO, and thereafter at a continuous oral dose of 60 mg/kg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2-associated X protein (Bax)-positive cells, and improved the CBF in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In diabetic rats, cilostazol reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, and the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic and Bax-positive cells, 96 and 168 hours after 2VO, but did not improve the CBF 4 hours after 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol increased the number of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 (Bcl-2)-positive cells in both strains 48, 96, and 168 hours after 2VO, but did not improve vessel wall thickness or collagen deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol appeared to limit venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by improving the penumbral CBF in nondiabetic rats, and inhibited pro-apoptotic changes through Bcl-2 overexpression, without improving the CBF in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
