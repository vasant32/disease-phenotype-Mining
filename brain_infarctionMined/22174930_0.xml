<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we developed a new panel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> biomarkers, and report here on their relationships with pathophysiological complications and outcomes following severe aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients provided serial cerebrospinal fluid samples for up to 10 days and were evaluated by ultrasonography, angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional outcomes were assessed at hospital discharge and 6-9 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight biomarkers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain damage were quantified: calpain-derived α-spectrin N- and C-terminal fragments (CCSntf and CCSctf), hypophosphorylated neurofilament H,14-3-3 β and ζ, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, neuron-specific enolase, and S100β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8 biomarkers rose up to 100-fold in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Better than any single biomarker, a set of 6 correlated significantly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CSF levels of 14-3-3β, CCSntf, and NSE were early predictors of subsequent moderate-to-severe vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that a panel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> biomarkers may predict lasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> and the pathophysiological processes that lead to it following aSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The panel may be valuable as surrogate endpoints for controlled clinical evaluation of treatment interventions and for guiding aSAH patient care </plain></SENT>
