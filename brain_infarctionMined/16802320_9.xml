<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of E64d, a mu-calpain and cathepsin B inhibitor, in the prevention of neuronal and endothelial apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent 2 hr of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> from middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and were sacrificed 24 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>E64d (5 mg/ kg intraperitoneally) was administered 30 min before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment included neurological function, infarction volume, brain water content, blood-brain barrier permeability, histology, and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The E64d-treated rats had significant brain protection against ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a reduction of infarction volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and improved neurological scores in E64d-treated rats compared with the nontreated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a remarkable reduction in both proteases and caspase-3 activation and apoptotic changes in both neurons and endothelial cells in E64d-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that E64d protects the brain against ischemic/reperfusion injury by attenuating neuronal and endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
