<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 120 patients with INO (87 unilateral [9 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e>], 33 bilateral) for OTR (subjective visual vertical [SVV], ocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath>, skew deviation) to localize causative brainstem lesions in MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unilateral INO was accompanied by at least one component of OTR: SVV tilt in 96%, ocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in 79%, and skew deviation in 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> components were directed to the contralesional side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contralateral OTR occurred in 89% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 9% of patients with bilateral INO exhibited OTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI showed distinct lesions in 68%, which almost exclusively projected onto the pontomesencephalic medial longitudinal fascicle (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up measurements revealed SVV and ocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> normalized faster than the adduction deficit in INO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: First, unilateral internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> (INO) is regularly associated with contraversive ocular tilt reaction (OTR): INO plus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, graviceptive pathways join the medial longitudinal fascicle after crossing between the vestibular and abducens nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Second, the different time course and degree of recovery of OTR components and INO signs can be explained by the hypothesis that vestibular tone imbalance is compensated by central vestibular adaptation mechanisms (probably driven mainly by cerebellar-vestibular projections), whereas impaired adduction is less susceptible to compensation according to Hering's law and can only be overcome by lesion repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Third, bilateral INO is seldom associated with OTR, confirming that bilateral impairment of graviceptive pathways does not cause imbalance in roll plane </plain></SENT>
