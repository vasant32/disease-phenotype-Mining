<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to a left functional hemispherectomy, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that both nonparetic and paretic motor hand function predominantly activated the right primary motor cortex, whereas no activation was found in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the right central area yielded responses in both the nonparetic and the paretic hand, whereas no responses were obtained after stimulation of the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both techniques indicated that motor function was mediated by corticospinal fibers originating from the undamaged (primary) motor cortex and predicted no further loss of motor hand function after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, subsequent functional hemispherectomy induced no new sensorimotor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional MRI was repeated 22 months after surgery and matched preoperative sensorimotor functional MRI findings, confirming reorganization of the primary motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No additional reorganization was introduced by surgery </plain></SENT>
