<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their significance in middle-aged community-dwelling persons and the relative importance of these associations remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We simultaneously assessed the relation of white matter hyperintensities and BI with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and mortality in a middle-aged community-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2229 Framingham Offspring Study participants aged 62+/-9 years underwent volumetric brain MRI and neuropsychological testing (1999 to 2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and mortality were prospectively ascertained and for 1694 participants in whom a second neuropsychological assessment was performed (2005 to 2007), incident mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> outcomes were related to white matter hyperintensities volume (WMHV), age-specific extensive WMHV and BI adjusting for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extensive WMHV and BI were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (hazard ratio [HR]=2.28, 95% CI: 1.02 to 5.13; HR=2.84, 95% CI: 1.32 to 6.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WMHV, extensive WMHV, and BI were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR=2.22, 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.72; HR=3.97, 95% CI: 1.10 to 14.30; HR=6.12, 95% CI: 1.82 to 20.54) independently of vascular risk factors and interim <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WMHV and extensive WMHV were associated with incident amnestic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in participants aged &gt; or = 60 years only (OR=2.47, 95% CI: 1.31 to 4.66 and OR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WMHV and extensive WMHV were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.69; HR=2.27, 95% CI: 1.41 to 3.65) independent of vascular risk factors and of interim <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large community-based sample of middle-aged adults, BI predicted an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> independent of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>White matter hyperintensities portended an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, amnestic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> independent of vascular risk factors and interim vascular events </plain></SENT>
