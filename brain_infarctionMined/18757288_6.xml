<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously shown that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine 1-phosphate</z:chebi> (S1P)/S1P receptor-1 (S1P(1)R) axis contributes to the migration of transplanted neural progenitor cells (NPCs) toward areas of spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we examined a strategy to increase endogenous NPC migration toward the injured central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to modify S1PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: S1P concentration in the ischemic brain was measured in a mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NPC migration in vitro was assessed by a Boyden chamber assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endogenous NPC migration toward the insult was evaluated after ventricular administration of the S1P(2)R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> JTE-013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The concentration of S1P in the brain was increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and was maximal 14 days after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in S1P in the infarcted brain was primarily caused by accumulation of microglia at the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mouse NPCs mainly expressed S1P(1)R and S1P(2)R as S1PRs, and S1P significantly induced the migration of NPCs in vitro through activation of S1P(1)R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, an S1P(1)R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> failed to have any synergistic effect on S1P-mediated NPC migration, whereas pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of S1P(2)R by JTE-013 or short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression enhanced S1P-mediated NPC migration but did not affect proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, administration of JTE-013 into a brain ventricle significantly enhanced endogenous NPC migration toward the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that S1P is a chemoattractant for NPCs released from an infarcted area and regulation of S1P(2)R function further enhances the migration of NPCs toward a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
