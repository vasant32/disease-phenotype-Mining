<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prognosis of Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) should be determined in a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective cohort of The Shinken Database 2004 comprised details on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the new patients who visited The Cardiovascular Institute Hospital in 2004 (n=2,412), which included 286 AF patients (11.8%, 205 males, 64.1+/-12.3 years, 165 paroxysmal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this Japanese cohort of AF patients, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) was low compared with that in Westerners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> of these patients were also quite low, 1.7% and 11.2% at 1 year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> exhibited higher mortality (7.3%), and hospitalization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> increased the rate to 22.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mortality between paroxysmal and persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple Cox-hazard regression analysis identified hospitalization at initial visit and lack of anticoagulation as independent predictors for mortality, and existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> as the only independent predictor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS The present study identified the mortality (1.7%) and morbidity (11.2%) of Japanese AF patients during 1 year after initial visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and lack of anticoagulation were independent predictors for mortality, suggesting important roles of co-morbidities of Japanese AF patients </plain></SENT>
