<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A histomorphological study after 40 minutes following an embolism there were revealed clots in the cerebral arteries in 13 out of 14 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 1.5 hours in 1 of 17, and after 24 hours in none of the 10 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Directly following the administration of clots in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 20 animals of this series, there were symptoms of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemipareses</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> and myosis, a "trot around circles", etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 animals there was a complete regress of the symptom at different times (from 10 min to 18 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases there was an increased amount of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> in the cerebral blood outflow while subsequently was reduced, correlating with the time of clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morphological control did not depict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that the reason of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunctions</z:e> is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">obturation</z:e> by blood clots of cerebral arteries, while their normalization is due to a spontaneous lysis of the embols which obturated the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
