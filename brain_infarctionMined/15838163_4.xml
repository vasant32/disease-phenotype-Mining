<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To characterize the frequency and clinical features of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) abnormalities in the hyperacute phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed DWI in 21 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (mean age 64 years; 17 men and 4 women) during both the hyperacute phase (within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (within 2-9 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWI abnormalities were present in the hyperacute phase in 11 patients (positive group) and absent in the other 10 patients (negative group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These groups could not be differentiated based on the clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients from the positive group had abnormalities on MRI including T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery images as well as DWI, with lesions being located in regions similar to those observed in the hyperacute phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients in the negative group, new DWI abnormalities were noted in 2 during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients in whom MRI was performed in the hyperacute phase had DWI abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which persisted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that essentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hyperacute DWI abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients may indicate irreversibility and signify the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
