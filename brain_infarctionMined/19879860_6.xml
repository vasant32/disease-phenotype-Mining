<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">Deferoxamine</z:chebi> (DFX), an iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi>, is a promising therapy that lessens <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, mitigates peri-<z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and improves behavioral recovery after whole-blood-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this model, blood is directly injected into the brain, usually into the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This mimics many but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (e.g., there is no spontaneous bleed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested whether DFX improves outcome after collagenase-induced striatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, 3- and 7-day DFX regimens (100 mg/kg twice per day starting 6 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), similar to those shown effective in the whole-blood model, were compared to saline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional recovery was evaluated from 3 to 28 days with several behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for one instance, DFX failed to lessen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>-induced behavioral impairments and it did not lessen brain injury, which averaged 43.5 mm(3) at a 28-day survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, 3 days of DFX treatment were given starting 0 or 6 h after collagenase infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Striatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> occurred, but it was not affected by either DFX treatment (vs. saline treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in contrast to studies using the whole-blood model, DFX treatment did not improve outcome in the collagenase model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings, when compared to others, suggest that there are critical differences between these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perhaps, the current clinical work with DFX will help identify the more clinically predictive model for future neuroprotection studies </plain></SENT>
