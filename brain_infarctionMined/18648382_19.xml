<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rationale that the utilization of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketones</z:chebi> by the brain results in elevation of intracellular succinate, a known inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> hydroxylase (the enzyme responsible for the degradation of HIF-1alpha) was deemed as a potential mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> on the upregulation of HIF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> (3 weeks of feeding a ketogenic diet), as pretreatment, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, after reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO), and the upregulation of HIF-1alpha were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), as a pretreatment, via intraventricular infusion (4 days of infusion before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was also investigated following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) proteins and succinate content were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 55% or 70% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was observed with BHB infusion or diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 proteins increased threefold with diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo>; BHB infusions also resulted in increases in these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As hypothesized, succinate content increased by 55% with diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> and fourfold with BHB infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the biochemical link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> and the stabilization of HIF-1alpha is through the elevation of succinate, and both HIF-1alpha stabilization and Bcl-2 upregulation play a role in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection in the brain </plain></SENT>
