<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was twofold: namely, to investigate the association of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549122" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relative afferent pupillary defect</z:e> (RAPD) in acquired suprageniculate lesions with the location and extent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, we suggest a new strategy of lesion analysis by combining established techniques with the stereotaxic probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas developed by the JÃ¼lich group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RAPD was quantified clinically by two independent examiners with graded neutral density filters (swinging flashlight test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using MRI in each individual, cerebral regions commonly affected in patients with a RAPD but spared in patients without a RAPD were determined and subsequently assessed by using cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A RAPD was present in 10/23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of patients showing a RAPD vs those not showing a RAPD revealed that a region including the course of the optic radiation at its early beginning in the temporal white matter is commonly associated with a RAPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that the pupillary light reflex (PLR) depends on the input of suprageniculate neurons, thus supporting the involvement of a cortical pathway also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The site of integration of cortical signals in relation to the PLR into the pupillomotor pathway may be located suprageniculately in the vicinity of the lateral geniculate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the suggested combination of established lesion analysis techniques with the probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas turned out to be a very helpful amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> data analyses </plain></SENT>
