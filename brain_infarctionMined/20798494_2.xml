<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 237 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 257 patients with SBIs, and 216 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For control subjects, we selected healthy individuals matched for gender and age from those individuals who came to our hospital for health examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TNF-α-308G→A and -238G→A genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the TNF-α-308G→A polymorphism was significantly different between the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the control group (GG vs. GA+AA; adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 0.50; 95% CI 0.255-0.989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By subgroup analysis, when tHcy levels were stratified into high (&gt;10.80 μmol/l), moderate (8.21-10.80 μmol/l), and low levels (&lt;8.21 μmol/l), the frequency of the TNF-α-308GA+AA genotype in the highest tertile group was higher than in the lowest tertile group (AOR 2.46; 95% CI 1.063-5.699) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between SBI susceptibility and polymorphisms of TNF-α was not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tHcy levels were significantly and inversely correlated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels in the TNF-α-308GG and TNF-α-238GG genotypes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, SBI, and control groups (p&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the TNF-α-308G→A polymorphism is responsible for susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and is associated with high tHcy levels in Koreans </plain></SENT>
