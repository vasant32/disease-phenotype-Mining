<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate brain volumes, white matter lesion (WML) volume and asymptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI in a large cohort of patients with atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within the SMART-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance) study, a prospective cohort study on determinants and course of brain changes on MRI, cross-sectional analyses were performed in 1044 patients (mean age 58+/-10 years, 80% male) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain segmentation was used to quantify volumes of cortical gray matter, white matter, sulcal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, and WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> volumes were expressed relative to intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were rated visually and distinctions were made between cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, large subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the cerebellum and brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With older age a nonlinear (quadratic) decrease in total brain volume was observed and a nonlinear increase in ventricular volume and WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical gray matter volume showed a linear decrease with age and was stronger in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WML volumes also increased more strongly in men than in women, while ventricular volume decrease showed no sex difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present in 14% of men and women, and increased to 24% of subjects aged 65 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a population with atherosclerotic diseases, decrease in brain volumes with increasing age is comparable with findings from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, vascular pathology on MRI, as indicated by white matter lesions and silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may be more common </plain></SENT>
