<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of TRIF leads to the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While studies have shown that TLRs are implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury and in neuroprotection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> afforded by preconditioning, little is known about TRIF's role in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> following cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the role that TRIF may play in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a mouse model of cerebral I/R induced by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we examined the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3 signaling in ischemic cerebral tissue using ELISA and Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological function and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were also evaluated 24h after cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB activity and phosphorylation of the inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaBalpha) increased in ischemic brains, but IRF3, inhibitor of kappaB kinase complex-epsilon (IKKepsilon), and TANK-binding kinase1 (TBK1) were not activated after cerebral I/R in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, TRIF deficit did not inhibit NF-kappaB activity or p-IkappaBalpha induced by cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, although cerebral I/R induced neurological and functional impairments and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in WT mice, the deficits were not improved and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was not reduced in TRIF knockout mice compared to WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway is not required for the activation of NF-kappaB signaling and brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
