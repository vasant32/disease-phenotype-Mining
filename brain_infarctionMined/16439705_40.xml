<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BAO) is an infrequent form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which invariably leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or long-term disability if not recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A traditional recanalization approach based on historical controls and pathophysiological consideration is local intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) in eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This necessitates diagnostic evaluation and treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers equipped with an interventional neuroradiological service on a 24-hour basis, but its superiority to the technically simple intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) remains unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed systematically published case series of substantial size reporting the outcome of BAO after IAT or IVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 420 BAO patients treated with IVT (76) and IAT (344), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency were equally common: 78% (59 of 76) and 76% (260 of 344), respectively (P=0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was achieved more frequently with IAT (225 of 344; 65%) than with IVT (40 of 76; 53%; P=0.05), but survival rates after IVT (38 of 76; 50%) and IAT (154 of 344; 45%) were equal (P=0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 24% of patients treated with IAT and 22% treated with IVT reached good outcomes (P=0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without recanalization, the likelihood of good outcome was close to nil (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recanalization occurs in more than half of BAO patients treated with IAT or IVT, and 45% to 55% of survivors regain functional independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although improved therapy forms for BAO are necessary, hospitals not equipped for IAT may set up IVT protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of IVT is probably not much different from the effect of IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IVT represents probably the best treatment that can be offered to victims of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BAO in such hospitals </plain></SENT>
