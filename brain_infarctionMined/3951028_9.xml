<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients are found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> on CT scan for which there is no history or symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assume "benign" behavior of a carotid lesion, a patient must be both asymptomatic and "asignomatic." Likewise, when the morbidity of carotid operations is reported, silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> must somehow be taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated this "silent" disease in a prospective study of 100 carotid operations done on 91 patients over a 9-month period in our service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had arch and four-vessel selective arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed neurologic examinations and CT scans were done before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 91 patients, 78 (86%) had a history of neurologic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative CT scans showed infarction in 21 patients, but only 57% of the infarctions correlated with symptoms and/or history </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Arteriography showed a lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid systems supplying a symptomatic or infarcted hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following 100 operations, four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurologic abnormalities</z:hpo>--two had transient hemianopsia and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed a new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients as well as in eight other patients without neurologic findings; two of these silent postoperative infarctions were found in the hemisphere opposite the side of the operated carotid artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
