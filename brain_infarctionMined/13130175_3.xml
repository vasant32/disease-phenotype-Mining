<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> (LMWHs) have significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in animal studies but they have not been effective in clinical trials, probably because they were administered after ischemic injury had become irreversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to explore the temporal characteristics of the LMWH enoxaparin with the objective of determining the duration of the treatment window in a rat model of temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by the intraluminal suture, middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin (10 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously twice; the first dose was administered to different groups of animals either 1 h before or 1.5, 3, or 5 h after MCAO, and the second 4, 6, 9, or 25 h after the first dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 48 h animals were tested for motor coordination and brains were removed for determination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and degree of motor impairment were a function of time of the first and the second treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the first treatment was given 1 h prior to MCAO, significant reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were obtained when the second treatment was given up to 6 h after the first (5 h after MCAO), but not when the second dose was given at longer intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the first treatment was given 1.5 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was observed only in the group treated for the second time 4 h after the first injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the first treatment was given 3 h after MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was not reduced in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, if enoxaparin was administered intravenously rather than subcutaneously, significant reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were obtained when the first dose was given as long as 5 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that enoxaparin can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in rats when administered prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and suggest that the drug might be considered for prophylactic treatment in a phase 3 clinical trial </plain></SENT>
