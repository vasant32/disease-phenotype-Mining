<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to study the effects of exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16136">hydrogen sulfide</z:chebi> (H(2)S) on global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion(I/R) and the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a 24h I/R, administration of NaHS, an exogenous donor for H(2)S, at the dose of 0.2 or 0.4μmol/kg significantly decreased the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">apoplexy</z:e> index, neurological symptom scoring, and brain infarcted area as compared to the I/R group in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, NaHS-treated rats displayed significant reduction of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> content, and striking increase of SOD activity in the brain tissues compared with I/R group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The up-regulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of p47(phox) and gp91(phox) subunits of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase were also suppressed by NaHS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in I/R group were markedly increased by 24h I/R, which were significantly attenuated by NaHS in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was markedly induced by NaHS administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly decreased in I/R group compared with the sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This reduction was significantly blunted in NaHS-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax content in brain tissues of I/R group was markedly elevated compared with sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And such an induction of Bax content was significantly ameliorated by NaHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16136">hydrogen sulfide</z:chebi> has potent protective effect against a severe cerebral injury induced by a global I/R possibly through the inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
