<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 368 healthy subjects age 39 years or older living in a Japanese rural community, performing baseline and clinical assessments and brain MRI (T2(∗)-weighted, T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed global cognitive function in subjects age 60 years or older using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An MMSE score &gt;1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean score for a particular age group was considered subnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MBs were present in 14 of 368 subjects overall (3.8%; 11 males and 3 females) and in 14 of 225 subjects age≥60 years (6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression analysis, older age (odds ratio [OR]=2.649/10 years; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.465-4.788) and male sex (OR=6.876; 95% CI=1.801-26.248) were significantly related to the presence of MBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and white matter lesions was correlated with MBs, suggesting that MBs were the consequence of small-vessel diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between the presence of MBs and subnormal cognition defined by MMSE (OR=5.226; 95% CI=1.463-18.662) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that in healthy community-dwelling subjects, MBs may be a consequence of small-vessel disease, which is correlated with aging, male sex, and subnormal cognition </plain></SENT>
