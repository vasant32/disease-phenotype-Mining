<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To study the rules that apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) changes with time and space in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and to provide the evidence in defining the infarction stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 117 work-ups in 98 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (12 hyperacute, 43 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo>, 10 steady, and 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarctions) were imaged with both conventional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values, the relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (rADC) values, and the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values or rADC values from the center to the periphery of the lesion were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values and the rADC values of hyperacute and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction lesion depressed obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rADC values in hyperacute and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage was minimized, and increased progressively as time passed and appeared as "pseudonormal" values in approximately 8 to 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, rADC values became greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was positive correlation between rADC values and time (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values and the rADC values in hyperacute and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions had gradient signs that these lesions increased from the center to the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values and the rADC values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> lesions had adverse gradient signs that these lesions decreased from the center to the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of infarction lesions have evolution rules with time and space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The evolution rules with time and those in space can be helpful to decide the clinical stage, and to provide the evidence in guiding the treatment or judging the prognosis in infarction </plain></SENT>
