<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we study the involvement of ApoE in the restoration of brain function after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, by using animal housing conditions that differentially improve recovery after occlusion of the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that after MCAO the ApoE levels increased in the injured hemisphere over a 30 days recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exception was a proximal narrow peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rim, in which ApoE was solely localized in S100beta(+)/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) negative reactive astrocytes at 4 to 7 days of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enriched housing after MCAO caused a marked decrease in ApoE levels compared with standard housing conditions, particularly in the ApoE/S100beta(+) reactive astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the levels of interleukin 1beta were lower in animals housed in an enriched environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> a zone for tissue reorganization with low cellular ApoE levels is formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the strong sensori-motor stimulation provided by enriched housing conditions mitigates the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> decreasing the level of ApoE that may contribute to the observed improvement of functional recovery </plain></SENT>
