<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was shown to be associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while the HLA-DRB1*02 allele may be protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBI) are unusual in Kuwaiti children with SCD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> of the femoral head (AVNFH) is quite common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modulatory association factors must still be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An investigation of HLA-DRB1 alleles was carried out in a group of 68 Kuwaiti SS patients, of age 7-44 years, of whom 20 (29.4%) had AVNFH, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of 167 apparently healthy age- and sex-matched individuals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the HLA alleles between the whole SS group and the controls showed a significant over-representation of DRB1*01 (P &lt; 0.01) and DRB1*10 (P &lt; 0.05) in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the allele frequencies in the SS patients with or without AVNFH were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It therefore appears that the HLA-DRB1 locus does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AVNFH Kuwaiti patients </plain></SENT>
