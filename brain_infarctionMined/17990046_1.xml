<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical characteristics, outcome, and risk factor for cerebrovascular disease in patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> and white matter hyperintensity (WMHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 123 new patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> by semi-structured interview underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were placed into one of three groups based on results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with no abnormal findings (NF), patients with WMHI and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (WMHI), and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the WMHI group, age at initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and age at time of interview were both higher than in the NF group, as was severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hamilton Rating Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (HRSD) scores were significantly higher in the WMHI group than in the NF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total WMHI was significantly correlated only with age at initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and age at time of interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the WMHI group, age at interview was lower than in the LI group and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis regarding the clinical outcome of remission was conducted, but no significant differences were discovered among the three groups, WMHI, LI, and NF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> rate was significantly higher in the LI group than in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The origin and clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> accompanied by WMHI may be specific; additional stringent study in comparison with individuals with LI is needed </plain></SENT>
