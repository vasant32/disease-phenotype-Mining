<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBI) are a common finding both in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free patients and in patients after a cerebrovascular incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are considered a risk factor for subsequent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their influence on outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with thrombolysis is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify the prevalence of SBI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients undergoing routine intravenous thrombolysis and evaluate the association between their presence on pretreatment computed tomography (CT) and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We systematically reviewed CT images and clinical records of consecutive patients treated with thrombolysis because of a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between 1 November 2003 and 31 July 2009 in a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the frequency of SBI and their influence on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present on 82/175 (47%) baseline CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SBI were significantly older (74 vs 67Â years), and more frequently had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (19.5% vs 11.8%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> (37.8% vs 21.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (18.3% vs 14.0%), 3-month mortality (24.7% vs 15.1%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or disability (50.6% vs 40.9%), which was also confirmed in a multivariate analysis adjusted for other clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, SBI were not associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> nor worse outcome after treatment with rt-PA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SBI should not be considered an argument against initiating thrombolysis, but further studies are needed to fully understand their association with thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
