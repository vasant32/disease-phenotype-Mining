<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether CBD neuroprotection is sustained over a prolonged period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Newborn Wistar rats underwent HI injury (10% oxygen for 120 min after left carotid artery electrocoagulation) and then received vehicle (HV, n = 22) or 1 mg/kg CBD (HC, n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham animals were similarly treated (SV, n = 16 and SC, n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of brain damage was determined by magnetic resonance imaging, histological evaluation (neuropathological score, 0-5), magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several neurobehavioral tests (RotaRod, cylinder rear test[CRT],and novel object recognition[NOR]) were carried out 30 days after HI (P37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBD modulated brain excitotoxicity, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> seven days after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that HI led to long-lasting functional impairment, as observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurobehavioral tests at P37, whereas the results of HC animals were similar to those of sham animals (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05 vs. HV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CBD reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 17% (p &lt; 0.05) and lessened the extent of histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the SV and SC groups in any of the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CBD administration after HI injury to newborn rats led to long-lasting neuroprotection, with the overall effect of promoting greater functional rather than histological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects of CBD were not associated with any side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results emphasize the interest in CBD as a neuroprotective agent for neonatal HI </plain></SENT>
