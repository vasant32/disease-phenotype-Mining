<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the presence of leukoaraiosis or multiple lacunes is associated with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) and 90-day outcome after thrombolytic treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were from a Canadian national registry of thrombolyzed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 820 scans were assessed, blind to clinical features, for the presence of severe vs no/moderate leukoaraiosis, and of multiple (&gt;2) vs no/single lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to determine if an independent interaction existed between the presence and degree of leukoaraiosis/lacunes and risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, and to evaluate the predictive role of leukoaraiosis and lacunes in relation to 90-day outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An overall symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> rate of 3.5% was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> increased up to 10% in patients with severe leukoaraiosis and multiple lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association was observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> risk and either severe leukoaraiosis (RR = 2.7 [95% CI 1.1 to 6.5]) or multiple lacunes (RR = 3.4 [95% CI 1.5 to 7.6]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple lacunes, but not leukoaraiosis, had higher mortality at 90 days compared to those with one or no lacunes (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.2, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in the good outcome rate among patients with and without leukoaraiosis or lacunes or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of small vessel disease on CT scan does not affect overall clinical outcome at 3 months in routine community use of tPA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> is observed </plain></SENT>
