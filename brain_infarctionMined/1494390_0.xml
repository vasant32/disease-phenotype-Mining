<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To ascertain CT features of hemorrhagic infarction, we studied the findings in 19 cases with autopsy-proven hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cases had multiple, mainly cortically located, small hyperdensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, some presented with a single hyperdensity, deeply located, that could be mistaken for primary intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarctions usually present as multiple, small hyperdensities within a hypodense area compatible with an arterial territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The shape can be round, slitlike, curvilinear, or spotted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most often the hyperdensities are located cortically; however, some larger, deeply located hyperdensities may falsely suggest primary intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some guidelines for a more reliable radiological separation between hemorrhagic infarctions and intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> are suggested </plain></SENT>
