<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The AchA is a known site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation, and is often exposed during various surgical and endovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the origin of the AchA, and an anomalous medial take off of the artery from the internal carotid artery, then a sharp lateral turn followed by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> course toward the choroidal fissure, unreported to date to our knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated successfully by endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the AchA, and reported variations in its origin are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thorough knowledge of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and attention to variations play an important role in the successful management of patients with neurological vascular conditions </plain></SENT>
