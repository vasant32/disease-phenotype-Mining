<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extensive evaluation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic event in the form of a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> found on brain magnetic resonance imaging was inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two months later, the patient was referred with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006882'>severe hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, which was managed with ventriculoperitoneal shunting in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ventricular cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shunt was complicated by distal end <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the insertion of a second shunt, and after 3 months of antibiotic therapy, peritoneal thickening was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peritoneal biopsy showed evidence of a granulomatous reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding, along with positive polymerase chain reaction of the cerebrospinal fluid, confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered from most of his symptoms after antituberculous therapy, and a new ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is a very peculiar presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> that began with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> due to vasculopathy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> without any constitutional symptoms, and was later confirmed by peritoneal pathology </plain></SENT>
