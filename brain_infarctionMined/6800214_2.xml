<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>68Ga-EDTA was used as a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings were correlated with those of conventional of CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A clearly pathologic accumulation of 68Ga-EDTA was detected in 29 of 41 PET scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The precontrast CT scans were negative in 11 and non-conclusive in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT after administration of contrast medium was performed in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 21 had a clearly pathologic PET scan and 14 had visible contrast enhancement on CT examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The injury of the blood-brain barrier thus was better demonstrated with PET than with CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The topologic diagnosis was, however, better demonstrated at CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems that CT and PET are supplementary examinations and that PET is superior to CT in the detection of injury of or absence of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
