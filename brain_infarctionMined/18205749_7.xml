<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that delayed administration of the general cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol following global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> provided transient neuroprotection and improved behavioral performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it failed to provide longer term protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigate the ability of delayed flavopiridol in combination with delayed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi>, another neuroprotectant to provide sustained protection following global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that a delayed combinatorial treatment of flavopiridol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> provides synergistic protection both 2 and 10 weeks following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, protected neurons in the hippocampal CA1 are synaptically impaired as assessed by electrophysio logical field potential recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is likely because of the presence of degenerated processes in the CA1 even with combinatorial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates that while we have addressed one important pre-clinical parameter by dramatically improving long-term neuronal survival with delayed combinatorial therapy, the issue of synaptic preservation of protected neurons still exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results also highlight the important observation that protection does not always lead to proper function </plain></SENT>
