<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>Vertigo</z:hpo> is a very common symptom at otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurological, and emergency units, but often, it is difficult to distinguish between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> of peripheral and central origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a hospital database, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted to the ENT University Hospital Graz after neurological examination, with a diagnosis of peripheral vestibular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and subsequent diagnosis of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> infarction as the actual cause for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001411'>spinning</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> after a thorough neurological examination and with uneventful computed tomographic scans were referred to our ENT department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of them presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000666'>horizontal nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 1 woman experienced additional hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean diagnostic delay to the definite diagnosis of a central infarction through magnetic resonance imaging was 4 days (SD, 2.3 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A careful otologic and neurological examination, including the head impulse test and caloric testing, is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because ischemic events cannot be diagnosed in computed tomographic scans at an early stage, we strongly recommend to perform cranial magnetic resonance imaging within 48 hours from admission if <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> has not improved under conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
