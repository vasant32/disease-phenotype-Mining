<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been applied to visualize monocyte infiltration with the use of intravenously injected ultrasmall superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (USPIO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, USPIO uptake in vivo remains elusive, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> enhancement patterns observed by MRI point to multiple pathophysiological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study focused on specific imaging of monocyte infiltration into the brain by transfusion of superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (SPIO)-labeled monocytes in a rat model of neuroinflammation, experimentally induced photothrombosis (PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At day 5 after lesion induction, animals were transfused with SPIO-labeled monocytes (5 x 10(6) cells) or free USPIO (17 mg Fe/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed 24, 72 and, 120 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate temporal changes directly after intravenous USPIO administration, MRI was performed repeatedly up to 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relaxation measurements showed that rat monocytes were efficiently labeled in vitro using SPIO (R2=12+/-0.9 s(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After transfusion of SPIO-labeled monocytes, a significant increase in contrast enhanced area (340%+/-106%) in the PT lesion was observed not before 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement after USPIO injection increased up to 407%+/-39% at a much earlier point of time (24 h) and diminished thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repetitive MRI directly after USPIO injection showed significant contrast enhancement in the lesion within 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that MRI enables in vivo tracking of SPIO-labeled monocytes longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our data suggest that contrast enhancement after injection of free USPIO does not primarily represent signals from peripherally labeled monocytes that migrated toward the inflammatory lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of SPIO-labeled monocytes provides a better tool to specifically assess the time window of monocyte infiltration </plain></SENT>
