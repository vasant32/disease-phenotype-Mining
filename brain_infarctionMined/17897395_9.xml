<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is conflicting evidence that APP/Abeta fragments may either enhance neuronal plasticity or be neurotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of overexpression of human APP in rats on functional recovery following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
