<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Injury to the brain (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) results in a disruption of neuronal connectivity and loss of fundamental sensori-motor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subsequent recovery of certain functions involves structural rearrangements in areas adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This remodeling of the injured brain requires trafficking of macromolecular components including cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, a transport carried out by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> D (apoD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the changes in the levels of apoD <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, and its cellular localization during a recovery period up to 30 days after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the core of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, apoD immunoreactivity but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased in dying pyramidal neurons, indicative of cellular redistribution of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During 2 to 7 days of recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the apoD levels increased in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and white matter areas in cells identified as mature oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apoD expressing cells were conspicuously located along the rim of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, suggesting a role for apoD in tissue repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, housing animals in an enriched environment improved sensori-motor function and increased the apoD levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggest that apoD is involved in regenerative processes and scar formation in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area presumably by enhancing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> trafficking </plain></SENT>
