<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to delineate prognostic variables in Israeli patients with anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> treated with endovascular multi-modal reperfusion therapy (MMRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from consecutive tpa-ineligible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with large anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving either the entire internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery territory were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were categorized according to TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed with the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS), and vessel recanalization was determined using the thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) scale at the end of MRRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score (mRS) &lt;or=2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients were included with a median age of 68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients died and 17 patients achieved an mRS &lt;or=2 at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with survival on multivariate analysis were admission NIHSS &lt;20 (OR 15 95% CI 1 to 230) and postprocedure TIMI score 2 to 3 (OR 35.5 95% CI 2.3 to 603.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with good outcome included admission NIHSS &lt;20 (OR 9.4 95% CI 1.3 to 71.3), day 1 NIHSS &lt;15 (OR 6.4 95% CI 1.1 to 38.4), and postprocedure TIMI 3 (OR 7.4 95% CI 1.1 to 50.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MMRT resulted in high survival and good outcome rates in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower baseline impairment and vessel recanalization increase the chances for good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the benefits of MMRT may merit further study and could be generalized to centers outside the United States and Europe </plain></SENT>
