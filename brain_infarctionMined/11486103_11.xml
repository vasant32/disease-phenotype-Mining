<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CADASIL is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e>, characterized by multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and finally <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which is caused by mutations in Notch3 gene encoding a Notch3 receptor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical, neuropsychological, imaging, genetic, and skin biopsy findings in a CADASIL patient homozygous for the C475T mutation resulting in R133C amino acid substitution, in comparison to 9 age-matched heterozygous patients with the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients were examined clinically and neuropsychologically and with MRI and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography for assessment of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene defect was analyzed by sequencing the products of polymerase chain reaction of exons 3 and 4 of the Notch3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dermal arteries were analyzed electron microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The homozygous patient had his first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at age 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is markedly earlier than the average, but the patient's heterozygous son had his first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>-like episode at the same age and another heterozygous patient had his first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when only 2 years older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was neuropsychologically more severely deteriorated than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 of the heterozygous patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 2 patients had the most severe (confluent grade D) white matter MRI changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography showed markedly reduced cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy revealed profuse deposits of granular osmiophilic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The progression of disease in the homozygous case was, however, slower than in the most severely affected heterozygous patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our homozygous patient's phenotype is within the clinical spectrum of CADASIL, although at its severe end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, CADASIL may follow the classic definition of a dominant disease, according to which the heterozygous and homozygous patients are clinically indistinguishable </plain></SENT>
