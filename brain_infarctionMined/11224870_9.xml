<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective case study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the association of cervical trauma with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e>, and to propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for suspected traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vertebral artery dissection</z:e> is a recognized but underdiagnosed complication of trauma to the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of spinal cord injury, however, may obscure those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e>, presumably causing gross underdiagnosis of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> admitted to the authors' facility between 1992 and 1997 were screened for cervical trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This article presents four patients with severe trauma to the cervical spine, defined as luxation, subluxation, or fracture, in whom symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> developed after a delay ranging from several hours to weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> typically was located at the site of vertebral injury or cranial to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with fracture of the odontoid process survived symptom free without ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another patient survived with traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> in addition to large cerebellar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior cerebral artery infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients died as a result of fulminant vertebrobasilar infarctions, both with only moderate impairment from the primary spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> include head and neck pain, often localized to the site of intimal disruption, which may be disguised by the signs of the spinal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early Doppler ultrasound and duplex sonography as a noninvasive screening method should be performed for patients with severe trauma to the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e>, immediate anticoagulation should be initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Traumatologists should be aware of this complication in evaluating patients with severe trauma of the cervical spine, and also for a variety of forensic reasons </plain></SENT>
