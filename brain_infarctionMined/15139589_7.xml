<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The repair enzymes to oxidative DNA damage, oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine-nucleoside</z:chebi> triphosphatase (hMTH1) and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> type of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi> DNA glycosylase (hOGG1-2a) in <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> and neurons of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, were previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, glial expression of these repair enzymes under such pathological conditions as cerebrovascular diseases and metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an in-vitro experiment using a <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cell-line under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was performed to verify the immunohistochemical results of post-mortem materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, hOGG1-2a immunoreactivities in reactive astrocytes were more intense than those to hMTH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oligodendrocytes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were strongly immunoreactive to both repair enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In-vitro study revealed that, hOGG1-2a is constitutively expressed in both untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> cells under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, although no immunoreactivity to hMTH1 was found in the control cells, accumulation of hMTH1 was rapidly induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the two repair enzymes to oxidative DNA damage are differentially regulated in glial cells, and that there is a difference in the expression of the repair enzymes between reactive astrocytes and oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
