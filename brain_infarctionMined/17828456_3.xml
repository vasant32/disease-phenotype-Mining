<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> observed in the amygdala following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> has been pointed out as a consequence of such an inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that inhibition of the inducible inflammatory enzyme Cox-2 during the reperfusion period may attenuate the apoptotic process in the amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anaesthetized rats were subjected to left anterior descending coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 40 min, followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cox-2 antagonist <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 10 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 72 h of reperfusion, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined and the lateral and medial amygdala were dissected from the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was similar between untreated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi>-treated animals (40-45% of the area at risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox-2 expression was significantly reduced in both parts of the amygdala in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> regression was observed in the amygdala of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> group as shown by decreased number of TUNEL positive cells and by decreased of caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was not significantly altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> while Akt activation was increased in the lateral amygdala but not in the medial amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This data indicates that inhibition of Cox-2 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> is associated with regression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the amygdala following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
