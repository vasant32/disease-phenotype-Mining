<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The North American and the European Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial investigators reported a conclusive benefit of carotid endarterectomy for patients with symptomatic 70% to 99% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been suggested that plaque structure may be an even more important factor in producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the ultrasonic characteristics of carotid artery plaques were closely related to symptoms and to the prevalence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred five carotid artery plaques causing greater than 70% stenosis in the ICA in 83 consecutive patients who underwent brain CT were characterized into four ultrasonic types: echolucent plaques, predominantly echolucent plaques, predominantly echogenic plaques, and echogenic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with permanent neurologic deficit were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant ipsilateral association between type 1 plaques and symptomatic hemispheres (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the 105 cerebral hemispheres assessed by CT had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an increased incidence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in type I plaques (37%) compared with 18% in types II, III, and IV combined (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that echolucent plaques are more frequently associated with symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> and provide further evidence that these plaques are unstable and tend to embolize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Studies on the natural history of asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> should investigate whether plaque characterization could identify a high-risk group </plain></SENT>
