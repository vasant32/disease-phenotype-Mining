<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypotheses that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in the fasting and postprandial state predict carotid plaque echo-lucency and that echo-lucency predicts a high plaque <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 137 patients with neurological symptoms and &gt; or = 50% stenosis of the relevant carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-resolution B-mode ultrasound images of carotid plaques were computer processed to yield a measure of echogenicity (gray-scale level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">Lipoproteins</z:chebi> were measured before and hourly for 4 hours after a standardized fatty meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 58 patients underwent endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On linear regression analysis, echo-lucency (low gray-scale level) was associated with elevated levels of fasting and postprandial plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P=.0002 and P=.002), IDL cholesterol (P=.0009 and P=.006), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>/chylomicron remnant cholesterol (P=.0003 and P=.0004) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P=.0003 and P=.003), the area under the plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> curve 0 to 4 hours after a fatty meal (P=.001), and body mass index (P=.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On ANCOVA, body mass index, fasting IDL cholesterol, and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were independent predictors of echo-lucency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Echo-lucency was associated with increased relative plaque <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content (P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> predict echo-lucency of carotid plaques, which is associated with increased plaque <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because echo-lucency has been associated with a high incidence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on CT scans, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> may predict a plaque type particularly vulnerable to rupture </plain></SENT>
