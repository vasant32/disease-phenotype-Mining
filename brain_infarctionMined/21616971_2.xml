<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is considerable intersubject variability in early neurological course after anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, yet the pathophysiology underlying this variability is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesize that, although not predicted by current pathophysiological models, infarction of 'non-core-non-penumbral' (i.e. clinically silent) brain tissue may nevertheless occur, and negatively influence clinical course over and above the established positive impact of penumbral salvage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to test this hypothesis, non-core-non-penumbral tissue was identified in two independent prospectively recruited cohorts, using computed tomography perfusion, and magnetic resonance perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up structural magnetic resonance imaging was obtained about 1 month later in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to map the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volumes of both the acutely silent but eventually infarcted tissue, and the eventually non-infarcted penumbra, were determined by performing voxel-wise analysis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and follow-up image sets, using previously validated perfusion thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early neurological course was expressed as change in National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 1-month assessments, relative to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the acutely silent but eventually infarcted tissue volume and early neurological course was tested using a multivariate regression model that included the volume of non-infarcted penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four and 58 patients were recruited in the computed tomography perfusion and magnetic resonance perfusion cohorts, respectively (mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-imaging time: 136 and 156 min; 27 and 42 patients received intravenous thrombolysis, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infarction of acutely silent tissue was identified in most patients in both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although its volume (median 0.2 and 2 ml, respectively) was much smaller than that of salvaged penumbra (59.3 and 93 ml, respectively), it was substantial in âˆ¼10% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As expected, salvaged penumbra strongly positively influenced early neurological course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even after correcting for the latter effect in the multivariate model, infarction of acutely silent tissue independently negatively influenced early neurological course in both cohorts (P=0.018 and 0.031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the first systematic study to document infarction of acutely silent tissue after anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and to show that it affects a sizeable fraction of patients and has the predicted negative impact on clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings were replicated in two independent cohorts, regardless of the perfusion imaging modality used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Preventing infarction of the tissue not initially at risk should have direct clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
