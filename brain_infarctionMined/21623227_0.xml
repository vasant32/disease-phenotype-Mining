<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Peripheral homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotomas</z:hpo> beyond 30° from fixation are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paucity of publications describing such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> might be attributed to various factors, including the absence of severe symptoms, routine visual field assessment restricted to the central 30° with automated perimetry, and the collateral circulation to the occipital cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to correlate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> and perimetric findings in 2 unusual cases of peripheral homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotomas</z:hpo>, with the anatomic location of the optic radiation and primary visual cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients with circumscribed homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotomas</z:hpo> beyond 30° related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the intermediate area of the visual cortex are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a new strategy, which relies on modern lesion analysis and stereotaxic probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, to accurately correlate the brain lesion site with the location of the peripheral homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Case 1, the posterior optic radiation was affected in its termination in the upper intermediate visual cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Case 2, the lesion was located in the upper rostral portion of the primary visual cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both, the most anterior part of the visual cortex and the occipital pole were intact, accounting for preservation of the central and most peripheral visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, correlation of the neuroimaging findings with commonly used maps of the representation of the visual field on the striate cortex suggested that our data were most consistent with the Holmes map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modern lesion analysis and cytoarchitectonic maps, in combination with the existing retinotopic maps, may provide reliable clues for the localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and prognosis of homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> and may lead to a better understanding of the link between neuroanatomical landmarks and functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
