<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present paper reports on an investigation of aphasic patients' preserved ability to perform a semantic task on spoken words despite severe impairment in auditory comprehension, as shown by failure in matching spoken words to pictured objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six aphasic patients (11 women and 15 men) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233715" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired speech</z:e> comprehension due to a left-hemisphere ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were examined; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were right-handed and native speakers of Polish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six narrowly defined semantic categories for which dissociations have been reported are colors, body parts, animals, food, objects (mostly tools), and means of transportation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An analysis using one-way ANOVA with repeated measures in conjunction with the Lambda-Wilks Test revealed significant discrepancies among these categories in aphasic patients, who had much more difficulty comprehending names of colors than they did comprehending names of other objects (F((5,21))=13.15; p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were most often the easiest category to understand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a simple explanation in terms of word frequency and/or visual complexity was ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence from the present study support the position that so called "global" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> is an imprecise term and should be redefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed within the connectionist and modular perspectives on category-specific deficits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
