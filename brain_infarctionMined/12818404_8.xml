<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between MPO polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI), one of the main consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated MPO G-463A and G-129A polymorphisms in 450 patients with BI confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 450 controls of the GENIC (Génétique de l'Infarctus Cérébral) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype determination of MPO was performed by polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype distributions for each of both MPO polymorphisms were found to be similar between cases and controls overall, and according to etiologic subtypes or gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the A allele of the G-463A polymorphism was 22% (95% confidence interval, 19.4 to 24.9) and the frequency of the A allele of the G-129A polymorphism was 6.8% (95% confidence interval, 5.3 to 8.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for BI in carriers of the A allele of the G-129A polymorphism was 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.39), and the OR for BI in carriers of the A allele of the G-463A polymorphism was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association between the main risk factors for BI such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, cholesterol, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and MPO polymorphisms was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In analyses restricted to cases, we identified an association between the A allele of the G-129A polymorphism and the size of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the A allele of the G-463A polymorphism was associated with a poorer functional short-term outcome as evaluated by the Rankin score (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MPO polymorphisms were associated with the extent of brain damage and the functional outcome rather than with the risk of developing a BI </plain></SENT>
