<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ischemic postconditioning reduces global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion-induced structural and functional injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten-minute global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by 4-vessel occlusion in male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals underwent postconditioning consisting of 3 cycles of 15-second/15-second (Post-15/15), 30-second/30-second (Post-30/30), or 60-second/15-second (Post-60/15) reperfusion/reocclusion or 15-second/15-second reperfusion/reocclusion applied after a 45-second reperfusion (Post-45-15/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 7 days of reperfusion destroyed 85.8% of CA1 hippocampal neurons and 64.1% of parietal cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cycles of Post-15/15, Post-30/30, and Post-45-15/15 reperfusion/reocclusion markedly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> after 7 days or 3 weeks of reperfusion and diminished the deficiency in spatial learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, a period of hyperperfusion followed by hypoperfusion was observed, both of which were blocked by postconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytosolic level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> increased significantly after 48 hours of reperfusion, and this was inhibited by Post-15/15, Post-30/30, and Post-45-15/15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 3 cycles of 60-second/15-second reperfusion/reocclusion failed to protect against neuronal damage, behavioral deficit, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first evidence that an appropriate ischemic postconditioning strategy has neuroprotective effects against global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injury and a consequent behavioral deficit and that these protective effects are associated with its ability to improve disturbed cerebral blood flow and prevent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> translocation </plain></SENT>
