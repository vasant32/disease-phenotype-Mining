<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women incorporates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, but it is uncertain if combined therapy provides major cerebrovascular risks or benefits to these women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No experimental animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies have examined combined hormone administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors tested the hypothesis that combined hormone treatment reduces ischemic injury in middle-aged female rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reproductively senescent female rats underwent 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) followed by 22 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> implants were placed subcutaneously at least 7 days before MCAO, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> intraperitoneal injections were given 30 minutes before MCAO, at initiation, and at 6 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats received no hormone, a 25-microg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> implant, a 25-microg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> implant plus 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>, or 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical, caudoputamen, and total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and digital image analysis at 22 hours reperfusion </plain></SENT>
