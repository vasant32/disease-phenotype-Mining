<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different aspects of executive functions were studied by widely used neuropsychological tests in 214 elderly patients 3 months after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and a sum score of eight different measures was counted in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number and site of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as well as severity and location of white matter lesions (WMLs) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on magnetic resonance imaging were recorded and compared between patients with and without ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ED was present in 73 (34.1%) of the 214 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the brain and in the left hemisphere was higher in the patients with ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits (e.g. pallidum, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata or centrum semiovale) were more frequent in patients with ED than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, patients with pontine brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> frequently had ED, but this may have been due to more extensive ischaemic changes in these patients in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean number of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affecting the pons and posterior centrum semiovale on the left side, moderate to severe medial temporal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, the Fazekas white matter score, the Mini-Mental State Examination score and low education were independent correlates of ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and WML affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits or the pons may increase risk for ED in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
