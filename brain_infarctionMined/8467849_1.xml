<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that patients at risk for cerebrovascular disorders and especially with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> have an enhanced velocity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increase in velocity was more marked in blood than in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A direct relation between this enhancement and the manifestation of intravascular platelet activation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> degradation might be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in patients with cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
