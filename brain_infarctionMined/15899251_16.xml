<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of these effects are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence points to a relationship between the vasculature and neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we asked whether cortical lesions induced vascular modifications in the distal SVZ in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions of the frontoparietal cortex were produced by thermocoagulation of pial blood vessels, a method that leads to highly reproducible loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cortical layers, sparing the corpus callosum and underlying striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These lesions induced increased immunoreactivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) around the walls of SVZ vessels, at a considerable distance from the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular permeability was markedly increased in both the SVZ and RMS by 3 days after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dramatic increase in endothelial proliferation was followed by expansion of the local SVZ vascular tree 7 days after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This time course corresponded to the proliferative changes in the SVZ, and a tight correlation was observed between the number of blood vessels and the increase in SVZ cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that thermocoagulatory cortical lesions induce distal vascular changes that could play a role in lesion-induced SVZ expansion </plain></SENT>
