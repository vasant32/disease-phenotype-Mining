<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential neuroprotective effects of tanshinones IIA (TsIIA) and IIB (TsIIB) were examined in adult mice subjected to transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that TsIIA (16 mg/kg) readily penetrated the blood brain barrier reaching a peak concentration of 0.41 nmol/g brain wet weight 60 minutes after intraperitoneal injection and decreased slowly over several hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced by 30% and 37% following treatment with TsIIA and TsIIB, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was accompanied by a significant decrease in the observed neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
