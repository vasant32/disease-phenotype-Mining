<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MRI) data sets were acquired in patients with focal lesions to identify affected cerebellar lobules and possible involvement of nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eyeblink conditioning was performed using a standard delay protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment 10 CS-alone trials were presented as extinction trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls showed significant effects of extinction that is a significant decline comparing CR-incidences in the extinction trials and the last block of 10 trials of the paired trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebellar patients, however, no significant effects of extinction were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with unilateral lesions effects of extinction were present on the unaffected, but not on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deficits of extinction were observed in PICA and SCA patients both with and without involvement of cerebellar nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extending previous reports in cerebellar patients the present findings show that the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere contributes to extinction of conditioned eyeblink responses in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It cannot be ruled out, however, that impaired acquisition affected the extinction results </plain></SENT>
