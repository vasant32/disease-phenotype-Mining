<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is the third common cause of mortality and the most common cause of morbidity in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MLC601 (NeuroAiDâ„¢) is a treatment indicated for post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase of impaired cerebral blood flow may be an important parameter for recovery processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of MLC601 on cerebral blood flow velocity as an indirect evidence of cerebral blood flow increase in post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a double-blinded, placebo controlled, randomized study of 80 subjects included within a week of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were given either MLC601 or placebo, 4 capsules, 3 times a day for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow within the middle cerebral artery, with blood flow velocity measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD), and Barthel index was assessed at baseline and at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean change in cerebral blood flow velocity in the MLC601 treatment group (15.9) was significantly increased (p=0.009) compared to the placebo group (9.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the treatment group also showed a significant difference in the mean rank of modified ranking scale (p&lt;0.001) and mean change of the Barthel Index: 36 vs. 29 in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study suggesting that treatment with MLC601 may increase cerebral blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may be mediated by an effect on stimulating microcirculation, an important process contributing to neuroplasticity in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect on cerebral blood flow may be associated with improvement in measures of functional recovery </plain></SENT>
