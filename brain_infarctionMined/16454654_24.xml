<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We showed that local delivery of the human tissue kallikrein gene into rat brain immediately after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) exerts neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of systemic delivery of the kallikrein gene 8 hr after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of recombinant human tissue kallikrein after gene transfer was identified in the ischemic brain region and blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of adenovirus encoding the kallikrein gene significantly reduced neurological deficit scores 2 and 7 days after gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kallikrein gene transfer also reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and promoted the survival and migration of glial cells from penumbra to the ischemic core from 3 to 14 days after gene delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kallikrein reduced I/R-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neuronal cells and inhibited inflammatory cell accumulation in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were blocked by the kinin B2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> icatibant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, kallikrein <z:mp ids='MP_0005601'>enhanced angiogenesis</z:mp> and promoted neurogenesis after I/R and the stimulatory effect of kinin on neuronal cell proliferation was confirmed in primary cultured neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of kallikrein, through the kinin B2 receptor, were accompanied by increased cerebral nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and Bcl-2 levels, Akt phosphorylation, and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase activity, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, Bax levels, and caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that delayed systemic administration of the kallikrein gene after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protects against ischemic brain injury by inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and by promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
