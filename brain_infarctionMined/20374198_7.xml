<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that leptin, an adipokynin hormone protecting against severe energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, would reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improve functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sabra mice underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (PMCAO) by photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following initial dose-response and time-window experiments animals were treated with vehicle or leptin, were examined daily by a neurological severity score (NSS) and were sacrificed 72 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined and the expression of key genes involved in neuroprotection and survival including the cannabinoid receptors CB1, CB2 and TRPV1, SIRT-1, leptin receptor and Bcl-2 was quantified in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A separate group of mice were examined with the neurological severity scale 1, 24 and 48 hours and 1, 2 and 3 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and were killed 3 weeks post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to examine metabolic status in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leptin given at a dose of 1mg/kg intra-peritoneally 30 minutes after PMCAO significantly improved neurological disability and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leptin treatment led to increased expression of CB2 receptor, TRPV1, SIRT-1 and leptin receptor and reduced expression of CB1 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was also a non-significant increase in Bcl-2 gene expression following leptin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that leptin may be used for attenuating ischemic injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> via induction of an anti-apoptotic state </plain></SENT>
