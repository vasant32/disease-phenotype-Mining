<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the protective effects of remote post-conditioning on ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> caused by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 54 animals were used in this present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> model was generated by 90-minute occlusion of right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve rats were used as control for studying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remote post-conditioning was conducted immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in the bilateral lower limb by occluding and releasing the femoral artery for three cycles; each occlusion and release lasted for 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours of reperfusion, the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were quantified by 2,3,4-triphenytetrazolium-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, brain water content was determined by dry/wet weight method, and damage to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was determined by Evans blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Remote post-conditioning significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damage (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the remote post-conditioning group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage was significantly reduced in the remote post-conditioning group when compared to the control ischemic groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that remote post-conditioning, which was initiated after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and before reperfusion, protects against brain injury in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
