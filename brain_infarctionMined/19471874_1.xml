<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we present a Chinese individual, YGA, who provides converging evidence to directly address this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>YGA has sustained damage to the left posterior superior and middle temporal lobe, and shows difficulty in orally name pictures and reading printed words aloud </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He makes phonological errors on these tasks and also semantic errors on picture naming, indicating a deficit at accessing the phonological representations for output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, he is intact at understanding the meaning of visually presented words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such a profile challenges the hypothesis that semantic access in reading is phonologically mediated and provides further evidence for the universal principle of direct semantic access in reading </plain></SENT>
