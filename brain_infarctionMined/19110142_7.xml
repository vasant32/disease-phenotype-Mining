<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging and other medical examinations were performed on 350 nondemented elderly individuals (121 male and 229 female, average age 72.4 years) who resided in the rural community of Sefuri Village, Saga, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mini mental state examination and modified Stroop test (MST) were used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter lesions (WMLs) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> on magnetic resonance imaging were measured quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses were done using a logistic regression model with a software package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> defined by mini mental state examination score less than 24 was present in 55 individuals (15.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had a lower educational level, significantly larger quantity of WMLs, and more remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frontal lobe dysfunction was detected in 52 individuals (14.9%) through prolonged MST score (&gt;36 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Impaired frontal lobe function was related to number of silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, larger WMLs, and more prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MST score in individuals with two or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was significantly more prolonged compared with MST score in those without infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that WMLs may cause rather diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, whereas multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are specifically involved in frontal lobe dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Silent ischemic lesions in apparently healthy elderly individuals seem to form a distinctive group of people with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This group should be the primary target of prevention of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
