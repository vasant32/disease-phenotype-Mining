<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Men, but not women, with unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) have an increased risk of cardiac events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with those without MI or with recognized MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether unrecognized MI is also a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and cerebral small vessel disease (white matter lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>) in 2 population-based cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the Rotterdam Study, 6347 participants were classified at baseline (1990 to 1993) into those with recognized MI (subdivided into Q-wave and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-Q-wave MI</z:e>), with unrecognized MI, and without MI based on electrocardiography and interview and were followed for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (n=613) until January 1, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Rotterdam Scan Study, 436 nondemented persons were similarly classified based on electrocardiography and interview and underwent brain MRI for the assessment of white matter lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In men, unrecognized MI was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (compared with men without MI hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.35) and with more white matter lesions and more often <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In women, no associations were found with unrecognized MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recognized MI was not associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in either sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men, but not women, with recognized MI had more often any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, especially if they had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0861151" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Q-wave MI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No consistent associations were found between recognized Q-wave or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-Q-wave MI</z:e> and severity of white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> did not change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Men with unrecognized MI have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and more cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
