<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 30) were divided into IS plus intra-venous 1 mL saline (at 0, 12 and 24 h after IS induction) (control group) and IS plus intra-venous ADMSCs (2.0 x 106) (treated interval as controls) (treatment group) after occlusion of distal left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were harvested on day 21 after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that BIA was larger in control group than in treatment group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensorimotor functional test (Corner test) identified a higher frequency of turning movement to left in control group than in treatment group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of Bax, caspase 3, interleukin (IL)-18, toll-like receptor-4 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were higher, whereas Bcl-2 and IL-8/<z:chebi fb="94" ids="17754">Gro</z:chebi> were lower in control group than in treatment group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot demonstrated a lower CXCR4 and stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in control group than in treatment group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistofluorescent staining showed lower expressions of CXCR4, SDF-1, von Willebran factor and doublecortin, whereas the number of apoptotic nuclei on TUNEL assay was higher in control group than in treatment group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining showed that cellular proliferation and number of small vessels were lower but glial fibrillary acid protein was higher in control group than in treatment group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADMSC therapy significantly limited BIA and improved sensorimotor dysfunction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS </plain></SENT>
