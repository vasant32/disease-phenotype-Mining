<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors propose that the optimal screening protocol for evaluation of suspected cervicocranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that includes three components: 1) contrast-enhanced three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) through the superior mediastinum, neck, and skull base; 2) three-dimensional multiple overlapping thin-section acquisition MRA of the skull base and Circle of Willis region; and 3) axial non-contrast, non-fat-suppressed T1-weighted, fat-suppressed T1-weighted, and T2-weighted spin-echo MRI from the level of the aortic arch through the level of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRA permits visualization of vascular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing or obliteration, which can suggest vascular dissection but can also be caused by congenital variation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, vasospasm, or extramural compression by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By directly visualizing the blood vessel wall, axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted spin-echo MRI can identify the intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of vascular dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This protocol is designed to maximize the sensitivity of a noninvasive technique and may eliminate the need for conventional endovascular angiography </plain></SENT>
