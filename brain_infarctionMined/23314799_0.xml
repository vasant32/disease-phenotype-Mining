<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to systematically investigate radiographic characteristics and outcome of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) changes in the elective coiling of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> with analyzing the correlation of antiplatelet therapy (APT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a total of 34 consecutive patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> initially treated by coiling without stent assist, 26 (76.5 %) had DWI changes with 91 high signal spots within 24-48 h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recorded DWI parameters (location, volume, mean, and minimum values of the apparent diffusion coefficient: expressed as <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(AVE) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(MIN)) for each lesion, and evaluated its radiographic outcome on conventional MRI at follow-up (interval, 58.4 ± 37.2 days) in the modes of APT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with DWI high spots had no clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(AVE) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(MIN) (r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(AVE) and rADC(AVE) were 0.74 ± 0.14 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 87 ± 10 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DWI high spots were small with a mean volume of 0.13 ± 0.12 cm(3), ranging from 0.04 to 0.86 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation was observed between the volume and values of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(AVE) (r = -0.48, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DWI volume was significantly larger in single APT than in multiple (0.15 ± 0.14 versus 0.10 ± 0.07 cm(3), p = 0.0091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The permanent signal change was more observed in single APT than in multiple (24.5 % versus 5.2 %, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DWI high spots after elective coiling were small without significant decrease of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, and do not correspond to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural use of multiple antiplatelet agents is expected to reduce the volume of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and permanent tissue damages </plain></SENT>
