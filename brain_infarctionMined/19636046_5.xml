<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are small cavitated lesions no larger than 2 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although often asymptomatic, they have been suggested as an important pathologic substrate of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and risk factor profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> has been variously reported, but the incidence data are scarce for large community-based data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants (n = 477) were recruited randomly from the electoral roll of community residents aged 60-64 years as part of the PATH Through Life Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic information and risk factor data were collected and MRI brain scans performed in two waves, 4 years apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number and locations of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as well as other volumetric data were assessed on T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In wave 1, 37 (7.8%) participants had at least one lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were detected in 6 (6/375, 1.6%) participants at wave 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lacunes present at wave 1 increased significantly in mean volume from 53.90 to 69.86 mm(3) over 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-2.60), anterior ventricle-brain ratio (%) (OR = 1.02; CI = 1.003-1.036), and volume of white matter hyperintensities (OR = 4.9; CI = 1.53-15.80) were independently associated with the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lacunes were common incidental findings in the brains of individuals in their 60s, and their prevalence as well as size increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the major treatable risk factor, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> was usually associated with severe white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
