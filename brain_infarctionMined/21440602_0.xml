<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe psychophysical performance of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with lesions in distinct cortical regions in the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients were selectively impaired on direction discrimination in several local and global second-order but not first-order motion tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only patient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> was impaired on a specific bi-stable motion task where the direction of motion is biased by object similarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this bi-stable motion task may be mediated by a high-level attention or position based mechanism indicating a separate neurological substrate for a high-level attention or position-based mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these results provide evidence for the existence of at least three motion mechanisms in the human visual system: a low-level first- and second-order motion mechanism and a high-level attention or position-based mechanism </plain></SENT>
