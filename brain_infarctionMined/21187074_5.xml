<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the relative importance of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> and ROS in cell damage during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was compared using photochemically induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>-conjugated albumin, and of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> (HNE)-conjugated albumin and 8-OHdG were evaluated as indicators of damage produced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> and ROS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>-conjugated albumin was much greater than the increase in HNE-conjugated albumin or 8-OHdG, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> is more strongly involved in cell damage than ROS during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that infarction led more readily to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> damage than to DNA or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> were released from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> was produced from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi>, especially from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Production of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> oxidase was clarified using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> synthase-deficient Gy mice and transglutaminase 2-knockout mice, in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> content is negligible or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15746">spermine</z:chebi> N(1)-acetyltransferase activity is elevated </plain></SENT>
