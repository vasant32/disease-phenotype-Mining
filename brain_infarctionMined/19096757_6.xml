<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many previous studies have reported that decompressive craniectomy has improved clinical outcomes in patients with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) caused by various neurosurgical diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However there is no report that compares the effectiveness of the procedure in the different conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors performed decompressive craniectomy following a constant surgical indication and compared the clinical outcomes in different neurosurgical diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy five patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 28 with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), 24 cases with massive intracerebral haemorrhage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), and 23 cases with major infarction (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The surgical indications were GCS score less than 8 and/or a midline shift more than 6 mm on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes were assessed on the basis of mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes of ventricular pressure related to the surgical intervention were also compared between the different disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Clinical outcomes were evaluated 6 months after decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality was 21.4% in patients with TBI, 25% in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and 60.9% in MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A favourable outcome, i.e. GOS 4-5 (moderate disability or better) was observed in 16 (57.1%) patients with TBI, 12 (50%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and 7 (30.4%) with MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The change of ventricular pressure after craniectomy and was 53.2 (reductions of 17.4%) and further reduced by 14.9% (with dural opening) and (24.8%) after returning to its recovery room, regardless of the diseases group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the mortality and GOS scores, decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion was found to be more effective in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> or TBI than in the MI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the ventricular pressure change during the decompressive craniectomy was similar in the different disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The authors thought that decompressive craniectomy should be performed earlier for the major infarction patients </plain></SENT>
