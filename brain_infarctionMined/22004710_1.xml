<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is one of the major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and is reported to aggravate the ischemic brain damage in different experimental models as well as clinical situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying the exacerbated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury associated with comorbid <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in pathophysiology of aggravated I/R brain injury associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 hours followed by 22 hours of reperfusion in high-fat diet-fed and low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi>-treated type 2 diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis were performed to detect the changes in expression of various ER stress and apoptotic markers such as 78 kDa <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153), and caspase-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect the extent of DNA fragmentation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diabetic rats subjected to I/R manifested significantly larger brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and severe deterioration in neurological deficits than their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, non-diabetic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a marked upregulation of GRP78 observed in brains of diabetic rats after 22 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, augmentation of CHOP/GADD153 expression and activation of caspase-12 (ER stress-induced apoptotic factors) were observed in parallel with enhanced TUNEL-positive cells or DNA fragmentation in diabetic rats compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats following cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Taken together, the current experimental findings demonstrate that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> exacerbates brain I/R injury which may be mediated through enhanced ER stress and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> involving CHOP/GADD153 and caspase-12 activation </plain></SENT>
