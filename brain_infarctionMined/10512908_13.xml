<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 43 patients presenting with a classic lacunar syndrome using diffusion-weighted MRI, a technique with a high sensitivity and specificity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> small-vessel infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were scanned within 6 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated with lesions in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), pons, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, and medial medulla; ataxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemipareses</z:e> with lesions in the PLIC, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, pons, and insular cortex; sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with lesions in the PLIC and lateral medulla; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>-clumsy hand syndrome with lesions in the PLIC and caudate nucleus; and pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a lesion in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Supratentorial lesions extended into neighboring anatomic structures in 48% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lacunar syndromes can be caused by lesions in a variety of locations, and specific locations can cause a variety of lacunar syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extension of lesions into neighboring structures in patients with lacunar syndromes appears to be more frequent than previously described in studies using CT and standard MRI </plain></SENT>
