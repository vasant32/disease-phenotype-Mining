<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI), 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), 36 deep venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> (DVT) and 50 healthy controls were entered in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma HCII activity was measured with chromogenic substrate method and the HCII antigen level by Western blotting assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma antithrombin (AT) activity was detected for the HCII deficiency individuals with DVT using chromogenic substrate method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean plasma HCII activity and antigen levels between BI group [(99.97 +/- 21.14)% and 0.96 +/- 0.24], MI group [(98.18 +/- 29.35)% and 0.95 +/- 0.20] and healthy controls [(96.80 +/- 20.11)% and 0.93 +/- 0.19] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma HCII activity and antigen concentrations in patients with DVT [(89.57 +/- 17.12)% and 0.87 +/- 10.18] tended to be decreased as compared with healthy controls, but they were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found for the prevalence of HCII deficiency between patient groups and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HCII deficiency individuals with DVT had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT activity and fibrinogen concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma HCII deficiency may not be the risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in the Han population of Hunan Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is needed to further confirm if decreased plasma HCII is correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
