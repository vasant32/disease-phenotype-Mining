<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Zinc-positive neurons and terminals, known to be associated with the glutamatergic projections in the brain, can be demonstrated by the histochemical Timm method and later modifications thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The adult rat neocortex contain a uniform lamination of zinc-positive cells with specific projections to, e.g., the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that fetal neocortical grafts implanted in the adult rat neocortex combined with rearing in an enriched environment can improve behavioral functions and reduce the secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of thalamus after cortex infarction in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to examine whether the expression of zinc positivity is ontogenetically inherent to neocortical neurons we grafted fetal neocortical tissue to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> or ischemic lesions of the frontoparietal neocortex of adult rats, followed by histochemical visualization of the vesicular zinc pool by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18212">selenite</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15138">sulfide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One further aim of the study was to elucidate to what extent the distribution of zinc-containing neurons and terminals in the grafts depended on rearing under different environmental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The foremost finding of the present study was that the overall density of zinc-containing terminals in fetal cortical transplants placed in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats is higher when the rats are reared in an enriched environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence and expression of zinc-positive neurons and terminals do not seem to be ontogenetically inherent to the cortical neurons as the fetal neocortical grafts placed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> lesions contained no zinc-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15076">selenide</z:chebi>-positive neurons and few or no zinc-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15076">selenide</z:chebi>-positive terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence or expression of zinc-positive cells may thus be induced by ingrowth of fibers and terminals from the host brain as transplants placed in the ischemic lesions expressed both zinc-positive neurons and terminals </plain></SENT>
