<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The direct visualization of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels provides a unique opportunity to study cerebral small vessel disease, because these vessels share many features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was reported that persons with smaller <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar-to-venular ratio tended to have more white matter lesions on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether this is due to arteriolar narrowing or venular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether smaller arteriolar or larger venular diameters or both were related to severity and progression of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 490 persons (60-90 years) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from a population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline (1990-1993), <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar and venular diameters were measured on digitized images of <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> of each participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1995-1996, participants underwent cerebral MRI scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We rated the severity of periventricular white matter lesions on a 9-point scale, approximated a total subcortical white matter lesion volume (range: 0-29.5 ml) and rated the presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On average 3.3 years later, 279 persons had a second MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions were rated with a semi-quantitative scale, and progression was classified as no, minor and marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was a new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the follow-up MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither venular nor arteriolar diameters were related to the severity of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Larger venular diameters were, however, associated with a marked progression of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age and gender adjusted odds ratios (ORs) per standard deviation increase were 1.71 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-2.61] for periventricular, 1.72 (95% CI: 1.09-2.71) for subcortical white matter lesion progression and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.06-2.39) for incident lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only the OR for incident lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was attenuated (1.24; 95% CI: 0.72-2.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between arteriolar diameters and progression of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was related to progression of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying venular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> deserve more attention, as they may provide new clues into the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
