<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Family and twin studies suggest predisposing genetic factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> represent a homogeneous phenotype, which is a prerequisite for genetic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Applying an affected sib -pair analysis, we prospectively assessed the prevalence of microangiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> (MBL) and associated risk factors among siblings of patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Index patients fulfilled clinical criteria of a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in combination with a corresponding MBL on CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Siblings were characterized as affected if MBL demonstrated on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MBL was compared with population prevalence data extracted from other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 784 patients screened, 81 index patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 97 siblings were recruited, of which 42% were identified as affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with data from unselected historical controls and stratified by age groups, prevalence was between 2 and 5 times higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies are feasible even in subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of MBL among siblings of patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> might suggest a familial aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, due to the small sample size these results need to be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by planned genetic analyses </plain></SENT>
