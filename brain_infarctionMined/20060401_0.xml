<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imitation in speech refers to the unintentional transfer of phonologically irrelevant acoustic-phonetic information of auditory input into speech motor output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence for such imitation effects has been explained within the framework of episodic theories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is largely unclear, which neural structures mediate speech imitation and how imitation is related with verbal repetition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two experiments were conducted, a standard repetition task, and a transformation task requiring phonetic manipulation of the presented auditory nonword stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonword materials varied sub-phonemically in word stress (pitch elevation magnitude; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi>) and in a parameter related to speaking style, i.e., the explicitness of final schwa-syllables (SSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined speech imitation in 10 healthy participants, 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003910" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phonological impairments</z:e> after left hemisphere lesions, and 11 patients with right hemisphere lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In repetition, significant imitation of SSE and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In transformation, imitation occurred in healthy participants and in the patients with right hemisphere lesions, whereas no imitation was observed in the patient group with left hemisphere lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that different areas within the left temporal plane influenced the degree of imitation of phonetic and prosodic detail in repetition </plain></SENT>
