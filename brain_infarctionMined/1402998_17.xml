<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycosylated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) were taken after a median delay of 23 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was assessed on admission, at 1 week, 3 weeks, and 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was assessed at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed cerebral tomography was performed on admission, and later on at 3 weeks or 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured from the CTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were diagnosed to have prestroke normoglycemia (n = 76) and prestroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (n = 23) on basis of the HbA1c level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The case fatality rate, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, functional outcome, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size did not differ between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of the non-diabetics correlated strongly with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation was observed between blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and the volumes of cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because prestroke blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, in contrast to post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, did not have any predictive value concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome it is concluded that high fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reflect a stress response to a more severe ischemic brain lesion </plain></SENT>
