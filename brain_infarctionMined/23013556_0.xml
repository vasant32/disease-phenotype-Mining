<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Men and women aged ≥18 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presenting to four tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan were screened using magnetic resonance angiography/transcranial Doppler scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trial of ORG 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment criteria were applied to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> from intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 245 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty scans were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, 206/230 (89·0%) showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent presentation was with cortically based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in 42·2% (87/206) followed by border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (52/206, 25·2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing degrees of stenosis correlated with the development of both cortical and border-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (P = 0·002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Important associated findings were frequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (166/230, 72·2%), silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (66/230, 28%) and a marked lack of severe leukoaraiosis identified in only 68/230 (29·6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 1870 arteries were studied individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery was the symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> vessel in half, presenting with complete occlusion in 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evidence of biological disease, symptomatic or asymptomatic was identified in 753 (40·2%) vessels of which 543 (72%) were significantly (&gt;50%) stenosed at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease is a diffuse process in Pakistani south Asians, with involvement of multiple vessels in addition to the symptomatic vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery is the most frequent symptomatic vessel presenting with cortical embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is a relative lack of leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Concomitant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in the symptomatic territory are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frequently associated findings </plain></SENT>
