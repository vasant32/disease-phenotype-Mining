<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study intends to systematically assess a lesion with potential clinical expression - the vascular convolutes of the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those, firstly described by Gertz and Frydl in 1987, are frequently reported in various studies as being associated to aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their mechanism seems to be an arteriolar tortuosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association with pathologically important manifestations, as brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> could be of clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was done on 70 consequently autopsied cases, on paraffin-embedded material, using the classical histological staining methods: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-Eosin and Masson's Trichrome, as well as the Gömöri silver method for reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our series, only two cases had specific features suggesting vascular convolutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More frequently were encountered <z:hpo ids='HP_0004948'>vascular tortuosities</z:hpo>, which seems unrelated to the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that vascular convolutes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004948'>vascular tortuosities</z:hpo> are dissimilar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both are less represented in reality than reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms of the two changes and their pathogenic significance are discussed </plain></SENT>
