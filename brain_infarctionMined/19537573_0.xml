<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Restricted sensory syndrome provides an excellent chance for the understanding of neuroanatomic correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The trigeminal nerve has been shown to convey buccal sensory impulse to central compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the pathway between cortex and the trigeminal sensory nucleus remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A patient presented with cheirobuccopedal syndrome, or objective <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo> confined to the left intraoral cheek, hand and foot, was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Decrease in pinprick pain and fine touch sensation was detected at the left intraoral cheek, hand and foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A recent infarction was disclosed at the left paramedian pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The foregoing hypalgesia and hypesthesia recovered within one month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The trigeminobuccal sensory tracts are deemed to run in parallel with other spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic tracts within the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rarity of buccal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e> upon brainstem damage may be due to dispersion of the trigeminobuccal sensory tracts on their way of ascending, or their relatively high tolerance to different insults </plain></SENT>
