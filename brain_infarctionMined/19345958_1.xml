<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 62-year-old man developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> heat anesthesia and deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e> in the right half of his body, but sensation for cold and pain was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resolution of these symptoms was accompanied by the gradual development of central dysesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) findings showed a small infarction in the left thalamic principal somatosensory nucleus (ventral caudal) and pulvinar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT showed hypoperfusion in the mid-cingulate cortex (mid-CC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), however, the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices were spared </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disruption of spinothalamocortical projection to the mid-CC and SMA is attributable to the development of central dysesthesia in the present case </plain></SENT>
