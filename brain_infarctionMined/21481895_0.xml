<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that aging is a significant factor in worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While many mechanisms may aggravate brain injury in the elderly, one such potential system may involve increased glial proliferation in the aged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient that could result in increased scar formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that in aged rats a single brain-only exposure to a low radiation dose prior to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> would reduce glial proliferation and confer a long-term neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain-only proton irradiation (8 Gy) was performed ten days prior to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in aged male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken in naive, radiation-only (Rad), MCAO, and MCAO+Rad groups at 2, 14 and 28 days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> followed by immunohistochemistry (day 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic lesion volume in MCAO+Rad group was decreased by 50.7% with an accelerated temporal reduction in peri-lesional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and increased water mobility within the ischemic core (39.8%) compared to MCAO-only rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the peri-lesional brain region of MCAO+Rad rats there was a decreased scar formation (49%, glial fibrillary acidic protein), brain tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (30%, aquaporin-4) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (58%, TUNEL positive cells) compared to those in MCAO animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In aged animals a single exposure to brain-only radiation prior to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is neuroprotective as it prevents glial hyperproliferation, progressive brain tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and reduces the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the peri-lesional region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased lesion volume is in agreement with accelerated reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in these animals </plain></SENT>
