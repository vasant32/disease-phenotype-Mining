<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one adults with a history of infarction within the territory of the posterior-inferior (PICA) or the superior cerebellar artery (SCA), and 25 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion localization was based on individual 3D MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The test took 10-12 min including subtests of naming, executive functions, attention, figural and verbal memory, reading, long-term memory, mental arithmetic, higher order motor control, and spatial functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though individual patients tended to make more errors than controls, neither total error score nor subscores revealed significant group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> appeared to be present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebellar patients as assessed by a bedside screening test </plain></SENT>
