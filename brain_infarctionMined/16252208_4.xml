<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> or malignant brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> require immediate interventions, but treatment options are offered mainly in specialized centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, interhospital transfers from primary hospitals need to be done without delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The telemedic pilot project for integrative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care (TEMPiS) connects 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers and 12 regional hospitals in Bavaria (Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Core elements are the implementation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> wards, telemedic consultation and improvement of emergency interhospital transfers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Organization of patient transports is offered by the central telemedic service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first 12 months of the continuing project <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> interhospital transfers initiated by the central telemedic service were prospectively documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Emergency transports were analysed according to diagnosis, type of transport, distance and time delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 252 interhospital transfers were recommended in teleconsultations; finally 221 transports took place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median total duration of transfers (including the necessary arrangements) was 134 min (interquartile range: 105-219) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> (N = 58), 138 min (95-157) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> (N = 31), 161 min (100-230) for malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (N = 22) and 147 min (109-180) for suspected basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (N = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time from admission in the primary hospital to initiation of interhospital transfer was 135 min (median; interquartile range: 86-172), transport time was 81 min (60-116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Helicopter transport did not save time for transfer distances up to 50 kilometres, compared to transport via ambulance (including assistance of hospital physicians) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Transport using a special intensive care vehicle was much more time consuming because of the longer transport preparation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Emergency transfers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients are time consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to additional harm being done to severely ill patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Faster organization and conduct of transports is required </plain></SENT>
