<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The American Heart Association recently redefined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> to exclude patients with infarction on neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given its advantages, MRI/diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was recommended as the preferred imaging modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined how frequently MRI/DWI was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and ascertained the proportion of clinically defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients who had ischemic lesions on DWI in our community in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinically defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> cases among residents of a 5-county region around Cincinnati who presented to emergency departments were identified during 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics and medical history, whether MRI/DWI was performed, and DWI findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equations were used to compare groups to account for the design of the study and multiple events per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 834 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> events in 799 patients, 323 events (40%) had MRI/DWI performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who had MRI/DWI were younger (mean, 66 vs 70 years; P=0.03), had less severe prestroke disability (baseline modified Rankin Scale score, 0; 44% vs 34%; P=0.02), were less likely to have previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (42% vs 56%; P=0.002), and were less likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (10% vs 16%; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 323 events with DWI, 51 (15%) had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive DWI were older (75 vs 64 years; P=0.0001) and more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (21% vs 7%; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Performing MRI/DWI on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinically defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients in our community would reveal more cases of actual infarction but would more than double current use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies should assess whether MRI/DWI is warranted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
