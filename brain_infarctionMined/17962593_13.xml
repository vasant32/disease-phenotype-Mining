<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Currently, a major focus on expanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treatment opportunities centers on the development of drugs and devices with longer time windows for use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the time intervals within which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients present to establish whether time window expansion will translate into more treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Attack</z:e> Surveillance in Corpus Christi project, a population-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> surveillance study in an urban, southeast Texas county </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This community does not contain an academic medical center, thus providing a "real-world" setting to capture patient arrival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> time was recorded from the chart according to a prespecified methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From January 2000 to June 2005, 2347 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 71 years, and 53% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one percent presented within 3 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; 13% between 3 and 6 hours; and 15% between 6 and 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-one percent presented beyond 12 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of patients with moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> presented in the 0- to 3-hour time window, whereas only 28% of mildly affected patients presented early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study provides estimates of time to presentation in a representative community without tertiary referral bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data are useful for planning <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy interventions and suggest that in addition to developing therapies with expanded time windows, research resources should also be devoted to reducing hospital presentation delays </plain></SENT>
