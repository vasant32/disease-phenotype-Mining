<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that high intensity training exercise exacerbates brain damage, while a moderate intensity (2 weeks of 20 min/day of treadmill training) reduces the injury caused by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), to hippocampal slices from Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, the effect of different running programs on severity of ischemic OGD lesion was examined, by the evaluation of three protocols designed to simulate exercise conditions common to humans: one or three 20-min sessions per week, during 12 weeks (moderate intensity), and two 20-min daily sessions for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OGD caused an increase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the incubation media, a marker of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and a decline of cell viability, as assessed by the decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dehydrogenase activity (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moderate exercise, three times a week during 12-week treadmill training, decreased LDH release after OGD, while one weekly session and 3 weeks of two daily sessions did not affect OGD-induced LDH released </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No exercise protocol evaluated altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data support the hypothesis that moderate intensity exercise reduces hippocampal susceptibility to in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
