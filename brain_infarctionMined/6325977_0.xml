<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that the combined administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and perfluorochemical <z:chebi fb="3" ids="38849">blood substitutes</z:chebi> is evidently effective in protecting the brain from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This experimental study was designed to develop more effective method in suppressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> than the combined treatment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> and PFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the "Canine model of complete ischemic brain regulated with a perfusion method" in which it is possible to control the degree of blood flow to a cerebral hemisphere via a perfusion pump, the effect of eight agents including six kinds as the free radical scavenger on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight agents were <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, vitamin E (Vit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, nizofenone (Y-9179), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (Dexa.) and suloctidil (MY-103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After pretreatment with each agent, blood flow was reduced via the pump to 1/10 of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state and 1 hour later, return to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent changes in EEG were observed and the effects of the drugs evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, no recovery of electrical activity was seen, but in six groups among eight treated groups, i.e., treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, Vit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E, DMSO, MY-103, Y-9179 and Dexa, gradual emergence of slow waves was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>And more favorable effects were found when the combined administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, Vit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>E and Dexa was made in the same experimental schedule as compared with the single administration of each of these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore in the animals administered with PFC in combination with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, Vit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>E and Dexa, flattening of electrical activity could not be seen throughout the period of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the power of electrical activity recovered nearly to the preischemic state immediately after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the possible mechanisms are not yet completely clarified, the present results are thought to indicate that this new combination therapy utilizing PFC with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi>, Vit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>E and Dexa may be useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
