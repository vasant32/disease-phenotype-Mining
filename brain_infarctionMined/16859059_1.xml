<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etiologic frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in young adults is different around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Iranian young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 314,000 young adult residents in the Southern Khorasan Province, East of Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, admitted to Vali-e-Asr Tertiary Care Hospital, entered this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical presentation, and investigations of consecutive patients aged 15 - 45 years, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, were registered in Southern Khorasan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Database between 2000 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent a standard battery of diagnostic investigations by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Etiologic classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the patients was made based on the Practical Iranian Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four patients (60 females and 64 males) were prospectively investigated during a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in young adults was 8/100,000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic mechanism constituted 54% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiologies in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> was present in 32% of the patients and caused 2.5 preventable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases per 100,000 young adults per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> is the most common cause and a preventable etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Iranian young adults </plain></SENT>
