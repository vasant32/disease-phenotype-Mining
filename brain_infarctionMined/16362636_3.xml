<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the main reasons might be the relatively narrow time window for intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study 2 different tissue culture models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, excitotoxic lesion by the use of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), were used to investigate the effects of delayed application of Cerebrolysin (Cere) on neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This drug consists of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties similar to naturally occurring growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After both types of lesion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> as well as delayed treatment with Cere resulted in a dose dependent and significant rescue of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the model of excitotoxic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> significant drug effects were found even when the treatment started with a delay of 96 hours after addition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the OGD model pronounced effects were found after 48 hours delay of treatment, and even after 72 hours a small but significant rescue of neurons was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of a single addition of Cerebrolysin to the culture medium resulted in significant protection until end of the experiments which was up to 2 weeks after the initial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A shift of the efficacious dosages from low to high concentrations indicates that most likely active compounds are used up, indicating that multiple dosing might even increase the effect size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion the results indicate that Cere displays a relatively wide therapeutic time window which might be explained by a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuroprotective properties and neurotrophic efficacy </plain></SENT>
