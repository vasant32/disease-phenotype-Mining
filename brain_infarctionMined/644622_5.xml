<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten cats received 50 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> prior to ligation; a second group of 10 cats received the same dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> 2 hrs after ligation, and the control group of 7 cats received no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed after spontaneous or induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the volume infarction was determined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the group receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> 2 hrs after ligation was significantly less than that of the control group, which received no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>; but the volume of infarction in the former group was significantly greater than that found in the experimental group, which received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> prior to ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the mortality after LMCA ligation was higher in the 2 experimental groups, which received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> therapy, than in the control group, which did not receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An hypothesis was advanced, which speculated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011734'>secondary adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> and altered cardiovascular function accounted for the increased mortality after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
