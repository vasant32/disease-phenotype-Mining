<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has become the method of choice to detect ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) of the central <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor ligand <z:chebi fb="4" ids="36929">11C</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> (FMZ) has been shown to be a reliable marker of neuronal integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 2 imaging parameters were compared with respect to the probability to predict cortical infarction in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, results from DWI (median, 6.5 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and FMZ-PET (interval, 85 minutes between DWI and PET) were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> extension 24 to 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Probability curves predictive of eventual infarction were computed using respective DWI, FMZ, and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values for voxels of interest (VOI) later classified as representing infarcted or noninfarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-five percent limits predictive of cortical infarction were determined for relative FMZ binding (&lt; or =3.2), DWI signal intensity (&gt; or =1.18), and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values (&lt; or =0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical regions with values beyond these 95% limits did not necessarily overlap with nor were fully congruous with final cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective median volumes for these regions were FMZ median 10.9, range 0 to 99.7 cm3; DWI median 15.2, range 0 to 116.0 cm3; <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> median 12.4, range 0 to 112.7 cm3; and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> median 14.9, range 0 to 114.7 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 83.5% of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, on average, was predicted by decreased FMZ binding, 84.7% by increased DWI signal intensity, and 70.9% by a decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The portions of the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> not predicted in the early investigation (false-negatives) were 4.8 cm3 (median) for FMZ, 3.7 cm3 for DWI, and 6.0 cm3 for <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The false-positive volumes not included in the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were 0 cm3 (median) for FMZ, 5.1 cm3 for DWI, and 3.6 cm3 for <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that FMZ-PET and DWI are comparable in the prediction of probability of ischemic cortical infarction, but FMZ-PET carries a lower probability of false-positive prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> include tissue not identified by these imaging modalities; at the time of the study, these tissue compartments are viable and could benefit from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy in predictive probability could be related to the fundamental difference of the measured variables: <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor activity is a reliable marker of neuronal integrity in the cortex, and movement of water molecules in the extracellular space might be a more variable indicator of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
