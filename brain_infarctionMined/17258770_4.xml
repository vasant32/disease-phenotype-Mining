<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Baseline severity and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome (Oxford Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project, OCSP) classification are predictors of outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used data from the 'Tinzaparin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trial' (TAIST) to assess the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, early recovery, outcome and OCSP syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TAIST was a randomised controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of tinzaparin versus aspirin in 1484 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity was measured as the Scandinavian Neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SNSS) at baseline and days 4, 7 and 10, and baseline OCSP clinical classification recorded: total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (TACI), partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (PACI), lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (LACI) and posterior circulation infarction (POCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recovery was calculated as change in SNSS from baseline at day 4 and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome and SNSS at days 4 and 10, and outcome (modified Rankin Scale at 90 days) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was significantly different between TACI (most severe) and LACI (mildest) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four time points (p&lt;0.001), with no difference between PACI and POCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The largest change in SNSS score occurred between baseline and day 4; improvement was least in TACI (median 2 units), compared to other groups (median 3 units) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If SNSS did not improve by day 4, then early recovery and late functional outcome tended to be limited irrespective of clinical syndrome (SNSS, baseline: 31, day 10: 32; mRS, day 90: 4); patients who recovered early tended to continue to improve and had better functional outcome irrespective of syndrome (SNSS, baseline: 35, day 10: 50; mRS, day 90: 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although functional outcome is related to baseline clinical syndrome (best with LACI, worst with TACI), patients who improve early have a more favourable functional outcome, irrespective of their OCSP syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, patients with a TACI syndrome may still achieve a reasonable outcome if early recovery occurs </plain></SENT>
