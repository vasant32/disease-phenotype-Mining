<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to characterize the utilization of decompressive surgery in the Czech Republic in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This nationwide study was undertaken from September to December 2007 using a questionnaire sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurosurgery departments in the Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and decompressive surgery was based on discharge codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient data were retrieved from hospital charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score ≤4 on the day of discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were obtained from 15 of the 16 neurosurgery departments in the Czech Republic (94%) and from 39 patients (11 female [28%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average patient age was 52 +/-14 years (11 patients &gt; 60), median time to surgery was 48 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 26-67 hours; 15 patients &gt; 48 hours), median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 22 (IQR 16-30), median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 341 cm³ (IQR 243-375 cm³), mean shift from the midline was 9.9 +/- 4.1 mm, median duration of hospitalization was 19 days (IQR 13-30 days), and mean bone flap surface area was 75 cm² (IQR 70-97 cm²) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A favorable outcome was achieved in 19 patients (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median number of procedures per site in 2006 was 1.5 (range 0-13 procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five sites (31%) serving one-third of the entire population did not perform any decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No variable was a significant predictor of outcome in a multiple regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In 2006 decompressive surgery was underutilized and occurred late in the clinical course in the Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Revision of national guidelines is necessary to incorporate the latest data and ensure that the patients who can benefit most receive treatment </plain></SENT>
