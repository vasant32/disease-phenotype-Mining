<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously found that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, attenuates neuronal oxidative damage in vitro induced by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> and oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to investigate the potential protective effects and associated mechanisms of Rd in a rat model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats administered with Rd (0.1-200mg/kg) or vehicle was subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rd at the dose of 10-50mg/kg significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved the long-term neurological outcome up to 6 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the underlying mechanisms, in vivo free radical generation was monitored using microdialysis, oxidative DNA damage was identified by 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine immunostaining, oxidative protein damage was identified by the assessment of protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> and advanced glycosylation end products, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was estimated by determining the malondialdehyde and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> formations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis results displayed a prominent inhibitory effect of Rd on the hydroxy radical formation trapped as 2,3- and 2,5-DHBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early accumulations of DNA, protein and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products were also suppressed by Rd treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although Rd partly preserved endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities in the ischemic penumbra, in sham rats without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activities were not affected by Rd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we assayed sequential <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in a later phase after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rd significantly eliminated inflammatory injury as indicated by the suppression of microglial activation, inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings demonstrated that Rd exerts neuroprotection in transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which may involve early free radicals scavenging pathway and a late anti-inflammatory effect </plain></SENT>
