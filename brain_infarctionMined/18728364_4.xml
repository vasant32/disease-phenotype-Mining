<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We compared ischemic findings on gradient echo-type T(2)*-weighted images at 3-tesla MRI (T(2)*WI) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and major vessel occlusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> or branch atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study population consisted of 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent 3-tesla MRI within 12 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Included were 24 patients (13 men and 11 women, mean age 68 years) with major vessel occlusion and 21 patients (11 men and 10 women, mean age 69 years) with minor infarction such as lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or branch atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We classified vascular ischemic findings of T(2)*WI into 3 sign categories, i.e. artery susceptibility sign, cortical vessel sign (hypointensity and enlargement of the cortical vessels) and brush sign (hypointensity of vessels in the deep white matter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased intensity in the ischemic parenchyma was designated ischemic tissue sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared regions of interest in the hypoperfused area on flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) images with our vascular ischemic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the vascular ischemic signs nor the ischemic tissue sign were found in patients with minor vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 24 patients with major vessel occlusion manifested the cortical vessel sign, 23 the brush sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area with ischemic vessel signs on T(2)*WI was almost as large or somewhat smaller than the hypoperfused area on FAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to the contralateral side, 14 of 24 patients (58.3%) with major vessel occlusion showed decreased intensity in the ischemic parenchyma (ischemic tissue sign) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Region of interest measurements on FAIR images demonstrated greater hypoperfusion in the area classified as ischemic tissue sign on T(2)*WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic vessel signs and the ischemic tissue sign on T(2)*WI at 3 T would be useful to evaluate the extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to major vessel occlusion and may be correlated with the blood-oxygen-level-dependent effect due to increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ischemic tissue sign may be reflective of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
