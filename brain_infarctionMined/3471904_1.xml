<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 8 months on these diets 69% of 58 SHRSP rats on 0.75% K had died, whereas 2% of 95 rats of 2.11% K died, a 98% reduction in mortality, P less than 0.000 001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 20 weeks the daytime and night-time blood pressure (BP) of each rat were measured intra-arterially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected two groups precisely matched for BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One matched SHRSP group (BP 182 mmHg) ate the 0.75% K diet and 30 of 47 rats died (64% mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other matched SHRSP group (BP 182 mmHg) ate the 2.11% K diet, and two of 35 died (6% mortality, a 91% reduction of mortality, P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seemingly, the striking reduction in mortality rate with the 2.11% hig-K diet does not depend on a lowering of BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-K diets do not change body Na or K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dry weight of mesenteric arterioles was reduced by 22% on 2.11% K diet versus 75% K (7.5 versus 9.7 mg) (P less than 0.001), indicating a greatly reduced hypertensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In nine surviving SHRSP on 0.75% K, 13 of 36 brain hemisphere slides (four slides per rat) showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 11 surviving SHRSP on 2.11% K, one of 44 brain slides showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (2%, a 94.5% reduction, P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain haemorrhage was reduced by 92% on the 2.11% K diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High-K diets allow cerebral arteries to carry very high BPs without sustaining damage to the artery wall, thereby drastically reducing brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lowering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
