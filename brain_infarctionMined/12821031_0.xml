<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight patients with LA were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty one patients (28%) were found to have focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> white matter infarction on DWI which could not be detected and discriminated on the basis of MRI findings alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> white matter infarction both showed hyperintensity on standard T2W MRI, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction revealed focal hyperintensity on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (16%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of LA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> white matter infarctions were calculated and found to be significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that DWI is necessary in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> periventricular white matter infarction from LA </plain></SENT>
