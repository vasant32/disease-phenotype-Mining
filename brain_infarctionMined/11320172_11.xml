<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> is a frequent symptom in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, there is little information on its anatomic specificity, spectrum of associated clinical characteristics, and etiologic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An investigation of 68 consecutive patients with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> due to a single infarction confirmed by MRI or CT was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>Dysarthria</z:hpo> was associated with a classic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome in 52.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>-central facial and lingual <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> occurred in 2.9% (n = 2) and 10.3% (n = 7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>Dysarthria</z:hpo>-clumsy hand syndrome was observed in 11.7% (n = 8) of patients and associated with pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and/or ataxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in 27.9% (n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions were due to small-vessel disease in 52.9% (n = 36), to cardioembolism in 11.8% (n = 8), and to large-vessel disease in only 4.4% (n = 3) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infarctions were located in the lower part of the primary motor cortex (5.9%; n = 4), middle part of the centrum semiovale (23.5%; n = 16), genu and ventral part of the dorsal segment of the internal capsule (8.8%; n = 6), cerebral peduncle (1.5%; n = 1), base of the pons (30.9%; n = 21), and ventral pontomedullary junction (1.5%; n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> affected the rostral paravermal region in the superior cerebellar artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extracerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> were located in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients along the course of the pyramidal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding correlates with the frequent occurrence of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0007256'>pyramidal tract signs</z:hpo> in 90.7% (n = 62) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Isolated cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases located in the territory of the superior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
