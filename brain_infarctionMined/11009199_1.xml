<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the exact localization of the lesions is difficult to determine because of the imprecision of "conventional" radiology (computed tomography scan and/or "standard" magnetic resonance imaging) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify which thalamic structures are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> associated with a single focal thalamic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected two patients who presented with unilateral postural and kinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> of the upper limb related to a localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequence (MP-RAGE sequence) was used to determine the precise topography of the lesions by stereotactic analysis using the atlas of Hassler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions were located within the pulvinar, the sensory nuclei, the mediodorsal nucleus, and the ventral lateral posterior nucleus (according to the classification of Hirai and Jones), the latter including the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim according to the classification of Hassler) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the Vim was spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subthalamic area, which can induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, was not involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After having compared the topography of the lesions with the clinical findings, we suggest that thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremors</z:hpo> may result from the interruption of the cerebellar outflow tract to the Vim within the thalamus </plain></SENT>
