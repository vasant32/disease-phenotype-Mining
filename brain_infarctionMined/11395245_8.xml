<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term brain metabolite changes on (1)H-MRS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) patients who had intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (ITMTX) and cranial irradiation (CRT) for central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) prophylaxis against <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven ALL patients (12 females, 25 males) with history of ITMTX and CRT for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age ranges at the time of diagnosis and at magnetic resonance examination were 0.8-13 years and 12-27 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interval since diagnosis was 5.6-19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) were performed to assess brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On MRI, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (LEP) and 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had evidence of hemosiderin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On (1)H-MRS no statistically significant difference in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>)/Cr was associated with LEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A lower Cho/Cr (p = 0.006) and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr (p = 0.078) was observed in brains with hemosiderin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linear-regression analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr or Cho/Cr with age at diagnosis, but there was a statistically significant decreasing trend of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term brain injury in ALL survivors after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis with ITMTX and CRT was reflected by decreasing <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr and Cho/Cr with the interval since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lower Cho/Cr associated with hemosiderin but not LEP suggested a different pathophysiology for these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
