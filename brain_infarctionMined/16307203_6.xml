<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modern imaging techniques allow the depiction of the mural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, even in CADs with only subtle vessel alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was (1) to characterize the angiological features in CAD and (2) to determine the frequency of initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrasonography (US) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 86 patients aged 44 +/- 11 years with CAD of the internal carotid (ICA), (n = 55) or the vertebral artery (VA), (n = 31), admitted to our hospital within 8 days (mean 1.6 days) of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAD was confirmed either by CT-angiography, MRI of the neck, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography or digital substraction angiography (DSA) and was compared with the results of the initial as well as repeated US examinations of the arteries supplying the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 75 patients (81.2 %) signs of vessel stenosis or occlusion were found while 11 patients (12.8%) with CAD of the ICA (n = 9) and the VA (n = 2) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> US findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The site of dissection in the US negative patients was highly variable without a predilection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 of 7 patients with repeated US examinations, complete vessel occlusion was found on follow-up, while in 5 patients again <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients, there were changing findings in two alternative confirming imaging methods (MRI/DSA, CT/MRI) and in one patient conflicting findings (CT/MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarctions</z:e> had occurred in 7 of the initially sonographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients while the other 4 had suffered from transient (n = 2) or local (n = 2) symptoms only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Approximately 1 out of 8 patients with subsequently proven CAD has negative initial neurovascular US findings despite comprehensive examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with suspected CAD and negative US examination, repeated US examinations and further diagnostic imaging, especially MRI is necessary </plain></SENT>
