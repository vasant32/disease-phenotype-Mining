<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A knowledge of the exact cerebral perfusion territory which is supplied by any artery is of great importance in the understanding and diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development and optimization of territorial arterial spin labeling (T-ASL) MRI techniques in the past two decades have made it possible to visualize and determine the cerebral perfusion territories in individual patients and, more importantly, to do so without contrast agents or otherwise invasive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review provides an overview of the development of ASL techniques that aim to visualize the general cerebral perfusion territories or the territory of a specific artery of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first efforts of T-ASL with pulsed, continuous and pseudo-continuous techniques are summarized and subsequent clinical studies using T-ASL are highlighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the healthy population, the perfusion territories of the brain-feeding arteries are highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This high variability requires special consideration in specific patient groups, such as patients with cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, steno-occlusive disease of the large arteries and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the past, catheter angiography with selective contrast injection was the only available method to visualize the cerebral perfusion territories in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several T-ASL methods, sometimes referred to as regional perfusion imaging, are now available that can easily be combined with conventional brain MRI examinations to show the relationship between the cerebral perfusion territories, vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or other pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased availability of T-ASL techniques on clinical MRI scanners will allow radiologists and other clinicians to gain further knowledge of the relationship between vasculature and patient diagnosis and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment decisions, such as surgical revascularization, may, in the near future, be guided by information provided by T-ASL MRI in close correlation with structural MRI and quantitative perfusion information </plain></SENT>
