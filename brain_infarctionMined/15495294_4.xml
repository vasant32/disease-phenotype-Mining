<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A national survey on health status and health behavior of the adult population included 15,379 Slovene inhabitants, aged 25-64 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 63,8%, and finally 9,043 questionnaires were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates per 100 of population were determined, and chi-square test was used for global assessment of interregional prevalence differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was carried out for sex and age adjusted assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest prevalence was confirmed in eastern Slovenia and the lowest in western Slovenia, with the exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, whose prevalence was lowest in central Slovenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences were statistically significant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (west: 0.5, center: 0.8, east: 1.1; p=0.045), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> (west: 3.5, center: 5.0, east: 6.9; p&lt;0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (west: 15.6, center: 19.2, east: 20.0; p&lt;0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (west: 12.5, center: 14.1, east: 16.8; p&lt;0.001), but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (west: 1.3, center: 1.2, east: 1.5; p=0.583) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (west: 3.5, center: 4.5, east: 4.6; p=0.097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study globally confirmed the hypothesis of existence of interregional differences in the prevalence of selected cardiovascular and related diseases </plain></SENT>
