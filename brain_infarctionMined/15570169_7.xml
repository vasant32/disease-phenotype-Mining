<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by 14% after 1 week and remained stable for the next 3 weeks compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of AT2, but not AT1, receptor gene expression by 3.4-fold and 5.0-fold was observed 1 and 4 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in TCV-116-treated rats, by about 30% when compared with control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological scores were also improved in treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of TCV-116 may be mediated through AT1 receptor antagonism and AT2 receptor up-regulation </plain></SENT>
