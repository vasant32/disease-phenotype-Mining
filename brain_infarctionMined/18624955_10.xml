<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> reduces postischemic rises in the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability and improves neurovascular dysfunction and hemorrhagic transformation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that activation of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic transformation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, herein, investigated whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> would ameliorate MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation and expression in a rat model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion using an intraluminal filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or vehicle was intravenously injected upon reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were measured, and neurological deficits were scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activity and expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by zymography, in situ zymography and Western immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion induced increased pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 activity and expression 24 hr after reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated animals, however, had significantly reduced levels in the MMP-9 activity and expression (P &lt; 0.01), in addition to reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and hemorrhagic transformation as well as improved sensorimotor neurobehavioral outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant change in MMP-2 activity was observed throughout the course experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-mediated reductions in ischemic brain damage and reperfusion-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> are partly attributed to its ability to reduce postischemic MMP-9 activation and increased expression, and further support the fact that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> is a suitable as an add-on to thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
