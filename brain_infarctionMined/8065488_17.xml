<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a pseudo-tumoral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients survived and their functional recovery is consistent with an autonomous daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> traumatic sub-dural haemorrhage died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ninth patient had presuppurative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and recovered with no disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> of the mesencephalon (n = 3), uncal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> which was either unilateral (n = 4) or bilateral (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICP was between 25 and 60 mmHg before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After flap removal, ICP decreased by 15% and, after opening of the dura, it fell a further 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients we were able to carry out continued post-operative monitoring of ICP, which stayed below 50% of initial values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decompressive hemicraniectomy is an effective means of treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> caused by carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> with a high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, where mortality rises to 70-85% when only medical treatment is administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No haemorrhagic complications, which can occur during hemispherectomies, were observed during decompression </plain></SENT>
