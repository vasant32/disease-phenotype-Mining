<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of them, 102 specimens displayed 193 infarctions of various extent and duration in the bed of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infarctions were solitary and multiple in 56 and 46 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The revealed infarctions were extensive (n = 22), large (n = 26), medium-sized (n = 86), small in-depth (n = 38), and small superficial (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of great (extensive, large, and medium-sized) infarctions was found to be pathogenetically associated with atherothrombosis obliterans, cardiogenic or less frequently arterioarterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> of ICA and its main branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic small in-depth and small superficial infarctions, as well as a number of median-sized infarctions occurred mainly via mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> in carotid tandem atherostenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent and location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> are greatly influenced by the site of hemodynamic carotid artery atherostenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the state of collateral circulation, the structure of the arterial circle of Willis, the state of the heart, etc </plain></SENT>
