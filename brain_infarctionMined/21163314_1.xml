<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuroserpin, a natural inhibitor of tPA, has shown neuroprotective effects in animal models of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms of neuroserpin-mediated neuroprotection after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> remain to be well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, our aim was to investigate such mechanisms in primary mixed cortical cell cultures after oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary rat mixed cortical cultures containing both astrocytes and neurons were subjected to OGD for 150min and subsequently treated with either tPA (5μg/mL), neuroserpin (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 or 1μM), and tPA together with neuroserpin at the mentioned doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after treatment, LDH release, caspase-3 activity, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, MIP-2, active MMP-9, GRO/KC and COX-2 were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences were analyzed using Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with tPA after OGD increased LDH release, active MMP-9, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and MIP-2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p≤0.05), but not caspase-3, GRO/KC or COX-2 compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with neuroserpin after OGD decreased LDH release and active MMP-9 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p≤0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It had no effect on caspase-3 activity, or on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, MIP-2, GRO/KC or COX-2 expression compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of tPA together with neuroserpin decreased LDH release, active MMP-9 and MIP-2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p≤0.05) and showed no effect on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, GRO/KC or COX-2 compared to control </plain></SENT>
