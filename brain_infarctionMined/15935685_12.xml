<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now observed in several experimental models that combining transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and exogenous erythropoietin may cause neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-dose erythropoietin (40 IU/ml) profoundly impeded synaptic transmission of rat hippocampal slice cultures when used in conjunction with moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (10% O2 for two 8-h periods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addition of erythropoietin increased viability of cultured rat embryonic cortical neurons at 21% O2 but decreased viability under hypoxic conditions (2% O2) in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> of human neuronal precursor cells challenged by oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation was increased by erythropoietin when cells were cultured under hypoxic but not under normoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In neonatal rats exposed to moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> plus erythropoietin, numbers of degenerating cerebral neurons were increased, as compared to controls or rats subjected to either <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or erythropoietin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, erythropoietin may aggravate rather than ameliorate neuronal damage when administered during transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
