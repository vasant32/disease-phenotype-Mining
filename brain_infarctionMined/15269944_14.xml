<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the development of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, as present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phase, by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases until up to four months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)- and T2-weighted (T2W) magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve consecutive patients with their first middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes were assessed on T2W images recorded with a turbo spin echo (TSE) and on images recorded with the FLAIR sequence on average on day 8 and after about four months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesion volumes in perfusion and DWI images taken within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On day 8, lesion volumes in images obtained with FLAIR exceeded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesion volumes were almost identical in T2W and FLAIR images but significantly reduced compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesion volumes assessed on DWI images correlated highly with the lesions in the images obtained with TSE or FLAIR, as did the lesions in the images obtained with FLAIR and TSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary lesion shrinkage was accompanied by ventricular enlargement and perilesional sulcal widening, as most clearly visible in the images obtained with FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesions are highly predictive for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite a dynamic lesion evolution most evident in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained with FLAIR </plain></SENT>
