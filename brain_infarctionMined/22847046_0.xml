<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was observed in a 60-year-old woman who suddenly collapsed and was found at autopsy to have a poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the lung with vegetations from marantic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> on the mitral valve and embolisation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the left kidney, the spleen, the right occipital cortex of the brain and the left ventricle of the heart </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histories of debilitating disease and/or arterial thromboembolic episodes necessitate meticulous examination of the cardiac valves with careful serial sectioning of the major epicardial coronary arteries and histologic sampling of both ventricles </plain></SENT>
