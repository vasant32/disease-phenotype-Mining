<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our investigation was to define temporal dynamics of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with different types of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 263 patients of both sexes, aged 55-68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>History, clinical examination and cerebral computerized tomography were performed to establish the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>97 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 66 had a reversible ischemic attack, 66 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and 34 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group included 22 age- and sex-matched patients, subjected to diagnostic lumbar radiculography, without disturbances in the cerebrospinal fluid passage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations were measured by direct radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results obtained in this research showed that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain ischemic period there was a significant increase of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentration in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase was highest in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, somewhat lower in reversible ischemic attack, and the lowest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> compared to controls (331.7 +/- 92.8 pmol/ml of plasma and 2.5 &lt; or = 1.1 pmol/ml of cerebrospinal fluid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maximum concentrations were found during the first two days after insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main potentially protective effects of increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> concentrations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could be the decrease of effects of deleterious reactions induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This mechanism might be an attempt of organism to compensate for disturbed homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is significant for monitoring the intensity of response of an organisam to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain damage </plain></SENT>
