<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">Methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) is the main regulatory enzyme for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated whether the MTHFR 677C&gt;T and 1298A&gt;C gene polymorphisms are associated with SBI and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 264 patients with SBI and 234 healthy controls in South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) concentrations were measured, and genotype analysis of the MTHFR gene was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma tHcy levels were significantly higher in patients with SBI than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite a significant association between the MTHFR 677TT genotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, the MTHFR 677C&gt;T genotypes did not appear to influence susceptibility to SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, odds ratios of the 1298AC and 1298AC + CC genotypes for the 1298AA genotype were significantly different between SBI patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of 677C-1298A and 677C-1298C haplotypes were significantly higher in the SBI group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the MTHFR 1298A&gt;C polymorphism is a risk factor for SBI in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genotypes of 677C&gt;T and 1298A&gt;C polymorphisms interact additively, and increase the risk of SBI in Korean subjects </plain></SENT>
