<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Fischer 344 (F344) rats at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 30 months of age and male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats at 2 and 6 months of age underwent photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with the photosensitive dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> by focusing a wide (6 mm) or narrow (3 mm) diameter white light beam on the skull overlying left hemisphere anterior frontal, midfrontal, frontoparietal, or parietal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were monitored with video and EEG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was performed with a computer-assisted image analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary finding of this study was that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were recorded in post-mature rats 2 months after lesioning the frontoparietal cortex with large photothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that extended to the cortical-subcortical interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were characterized behaviorally by motor arrest, appeared to originate in the periinfarct area, and could be distinguished from inherited spontaneous bilateral cortical discharges by the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, frequency, duration, and laterality of the ictal discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small cortical lesions were ineffective in producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> except for one animal that demonstrated recurrent prolonged focal discharges unaccompanied by behavioral change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stage 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were observed in a small number of mid-aged and aged animals lesioned with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in anterior frontal and frontoparietal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the technique of photothrombosis can be used to produce neocortical infarction as a means to study mechanisms of secondary epileptogenesis </plain></SENT>
