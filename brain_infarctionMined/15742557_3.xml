<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Liposomal nerve growth factor (NGF) was used for the treatment of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Positive charge inducing agents of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">sphingosine</z:chebi> (SP) and stearylamine (S) were formulated in the liposomal NGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose-response of intraventricular injection of liposomal NGF showed significant reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at the dose of 5 and 10 microg/rat of NGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The liposomal NGF formulated with SP or S demonstrated similar results in the reduction of total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When we increased the molar ratio of SP and S from 0.15 to 0.3, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from rats showed a similar value as that of the control treated with NGF solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liposomal NGF was given prior to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that NGF was effective in prevention of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NGF concentrations in brain for liposomal NGF were maintained in a level significantly higher than those for NGF solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to the positively charged liposomal NGF bound effectively in brain ventricle and caused longer retention time than free NGF for localization in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the effect of liposomal NGF on reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We assumed that the transportation of NGF might go through the cerebrospinal fluid pathway throughout the ventricular system and subarachnoid system to cerebral cortex to produce a therapeutic effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
