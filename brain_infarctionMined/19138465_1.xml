<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 247 consecutive inpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging findings of these inpatients were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CMBs were counted respectively according to their locations, including the corticosubcortical regions, basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of the old lacunes and the severity of the cerebral white matter changes were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the occurrence of CMBs, the patients were divided into two groups (72 patients with CMBs; 175 patients without CMBs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common location of CMBs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was the basal ganglia, followed by the corticosubcortical region, the thalami, the brainstem and the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of CMBs was closely correlated with the severity of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and cerebral white matter changes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: CMBs are closely related with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> and may be a marker of advanced stage cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
