<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neuroglobin (Ngb), a newly identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> in vertebrate brain, has been suggested to be able to protect against brain hypoxic-ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, owing to its large size, the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) to Ngb limits its application in brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the 11-amino-acid human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus trans-activator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain was shown to successfully deliver macromolecules into the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study explored whether the TAT-Ngb fusion protein can cross the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and protect the brain from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TAT-Ngb fusion protein generated from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was efficiently delivered into mice brain tissues by intravenous injection as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two groups of mice were treated with filamentous middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 30min or 2h followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each group was then divided into sub-groups and was injected intravenously with TAT-Ngb, Ngb, or saline respectively before MCAO or immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the Ngb- and saline-treated group, the group with TAT-Ngb treated 2h before MCAO showed significantly less brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and had better neurologic outcomes (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a TAT-Ngb injection following a 30-min MCAO treatment significantly increased neuronal survival in the striatum (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that the exogenous Ngb fusion protein containing the TAT protein transduction domain could be efficiently transduced into neurons in the mouse and protect the brain from mild or moderate ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
