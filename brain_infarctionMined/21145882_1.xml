<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To reveal the potential time-sequential molecular mechanism in the hippocampus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion mice, so as to provide pertinent evidence for differential treatment during different phases after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods Seventy-five male Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion for 3h, 12h, and 24h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cDNA microarray involving 374 cDNA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related genes, selected from the Science STKE database, was performed to detect the gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data analyses were performed in the FDA ArrayTrack system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were also uploaded to the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) to analyze the genetic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results Clustering and principal component analyses showed clear boundaries in the differentially expressed genes among the 3h, 12h, and 24h groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although 56 overlapping up-regulated genes and 2 down-regulated genes were identified in 3h, 12h, and 24h groups, the sequence variation of CA1 neurons and gene expression profiles also existed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the total number of altered genes, the top 3 GO categories were metabolism, signal and cell cycle, which shared 8, 11 and 5 overlapping genes in 3h, 12h, and 24h groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As for metabolism, there were 2 specific altered genes in the 3h group (casp8ap2 and mmp2), 6 in the 24h group (daxx, gadd45a, adamts1, adcy8, cyp51, dusp16), but none in the 12h group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the KEGG database analysis, 18 overlapping pathways were detected in the three groups; and 1, 12 and 2 overlapping pathways were noted between the 3h and 12h, 12h and 24h, and 3h and 24h comparisons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The gene expressions of Caspase 2 and Rgs6 were identified by real-time RT-PCR, which was consistent with the results of microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion Overlapping and variable genes and pathways demonstrate the time-sequential molecular mechanism in the hippocampus of ischemic mice, which may provide evidence for rational treatment during different phases after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
