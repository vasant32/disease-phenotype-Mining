<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that early ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) can afford protection against focal brief and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with subsequent reperfusion as well as permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats by amelioration of regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats (n=97) were subjected to transient (30 and 60 minutes) and permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> protocol consisted of two episodes of 5-min common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> + 5-min reperfusion prior to test <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> either followed by 48 hours of reperfusion or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> and Evans blue were used for delineation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and anatomical area at risk (comprises ischemic penumbra and ischemic core), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vascular bed was measured with use of Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> resulted in significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size limitation in both transient and permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> caused significant reduction of area at risk after 30 min of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as compared to controls [med(min-max) 11.4% (3.59-2 0.35%) vs. 2.47% (0.8-9.31%), p = 0.018] but it failed to influence area at risk after 5 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> [med(min-max) 7.61% (6.32-10.87%) vs. 8.2% (4.87-9.65%), p &gt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in blood flow were found between <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> and control groups using Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is suggestive of the fact that <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> does not really influence blood flow in the large cerebral arteries such as <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> but it might have some effect on smaller arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems that, along with well established cytoprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>-mediated reduction of area at risk by means of improvement in local cerebral blood flow may contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size limitation after focal transient and permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
