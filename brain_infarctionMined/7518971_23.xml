<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral endothelial cells are quiescent under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions; they are stimulated to proliferate around an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, although the mechanism is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we explored the relation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by participating cells in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was created in rats by ligation of a branch of the left middle cerebral artery followed by permanent occlusion of the left common carotid artery and temporary occlusion of the right common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains were removed after 1 to 14 days and studied with histological and immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) was used as an S-phase marker for the proliferative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Enhanced bFGF immunoreactivity was observed in neurons adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after 1 day, and the change subsequently spread to distant neurons in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 days blood vessels and glial cells around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> began to incorporate BRdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the first week new capillaries accompanied by macrophages extended into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The macrophages, endothelial cells, and reactive astrocytes expressed mild to moderate bFGF immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The spatial and temporal correlation between bFGF expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in conjunction with the well-known biological properties of bFGF suggest that bFGF produced by neurons, macrophages, and glial cells may participate in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
