<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As several biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathophysiology, treatments acting on multiple targets may be desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47807">Sulforaphane</z:chebi> (SUL), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate present in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to induce the expression of multiple NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) responsive genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrate that systemically administered SUL can enter the brain as determined by increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of the Nrf2-responsive gene <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 (HO-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed administration (15 min) of a single dose of SUL significantly decreased cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, suggesting a potential therapeutic value for this compound </plain></SENT>
