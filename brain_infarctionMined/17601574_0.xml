<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the site at which ganglion cell axons of the optic tract synapse with neurons that form the optic radiations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lesions of the perigeniculate visual pathway are characterized by distinct pupillary, visual field, and ophthalmoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such findings, combined with results from neuroimaging, enable one to precisely locate the area of the visual pathway that is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A patient who presented to our clinic with a complaint of narrowly missing several motor vehicle accidents recently was found to have a left horizontal sectoranopia on a screening visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of an old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involving the optic radiations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's medical history was significant for high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels that likely contributed to his having had several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accidents</z:e> in the past, one of which affected the optic radiations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Damage to the LGN and optic radiations can produce sectoranopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although it may not be possible to specify the exact location of a lesion, understanding the blood supply of the visual pathway and retinotopic organization of the LGN <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in the localization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that cause characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
