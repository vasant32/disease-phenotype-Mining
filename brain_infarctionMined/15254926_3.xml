<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of svCVD by structural imaging such as computed tomography (CT) is central to the clinical diagnosis but its accuracy is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the validity of CT to detect pathologically verified svCVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Leukoaraiosis, patchy lesions, and lacunes were assessed separately in different cerebral regions on CT scans of 87 elderly persons with Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 0 and 30 enrolled in the OPTIMA project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We rated small vessel disease on pathology separately in the white matter and basal ganglia as absent/mild, moderate, and severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of microinfarcts was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of CT lesions was associated with pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects with absent/mild leukoaraiosis on CT decreased and those with severe leukoaraiosis increased with increasing severity of subcortical small vessel ratings on pathology (31, 18 and 0%; 17, 23 and 50%, respectively; p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar association was present for patchy lesions (73, 59 and 17%; 7, 18 and 33%, respectively; p = 0.004) and lacune (83, 77 and 50%; 0, 4 and 17%, respectively; p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis, patchy lesions, and lacunes on CT were associated also with microinfarcts on pathology (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The standardized assessment of svCVD on CT films at the time of the diagnosis correlates with small vessel disease on pathology at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
