<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> from infancy would be expected to have a less favorable developmental prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the neurodevelopmental outcome in 33 school-age children transplanted between 1987 and 1995 when &lt; 5 yr of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively performed a neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, electroencephalograms (EEGs), audiometry, and neuropsychological tests (NEPSY), and measured cognitive performance (WISC-R); we related these results to school performance and to retrospective risk factors prior to Tx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (79%) children attended <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> school and 76% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of the seven children attending a special school had brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EEG was abnormal in 11 (35%), and five (15%) received anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> treatment after Tx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was documented in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean intelligence quotient (IQ) was 87, and 6-24% showed impairment in neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The children attending a special school had been more premature, but had not had a greater number of pre- or neonatal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They had experienced a greater number of hypertensive crises (p = 0.002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (p = 0.03), mainly during dialysis, but the number of septic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and the mean serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi> levels were not significantly greater than in the children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> school performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these previously lethal diseases, the overall neurodevelopmental outcome is reassuring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it is of crucial importance to further minimize the risk factors prior to Tx </plain></SENT>
