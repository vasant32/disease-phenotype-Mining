<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An elevated plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) level is associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies have shown associations between tHcy level and small-vessel disease of the brain on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In the Cardiovascular Health Study, 622 elderly participants without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had results for tHcy level and cranial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought associations between tHcy level and MRI findings of ventricular grade, sulcal grade, white matter grade, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We controlled for other factors, including levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and vitamins B(6) and B(12) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for age and sex, tHcy level was not associated with the individual MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further adjustments for other factors and other blood tests had little effect on these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant finding was a linear trend across quintiles of tHcy level and a pattern of MRI findings combining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and high white matter grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The linear trend remained significant after controlling for other risk factors and atherosclerotic markers (top quintile vs bottom quintile odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-11.20; P =.04 for linear trend) but was slightly diminished after further controlling for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and vitamins B(6) and B(12) (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-13.10; P =.07 for linear trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We were unable to confirm the results of previous studies with respect to tHcy level and individual MRI findings, although an association was seen for an MRI pattern combining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and high white matter grade </plain></SENT>
