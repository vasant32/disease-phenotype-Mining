<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Preconditioning with repeated electroacupuncture (EA) could mimic ischemic preconditioning to induce cerebral ischemic tolerance in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate whether mu (micro)-, delta (delta)- or kappa (kappa)-opioid receptors are involved in the neuroprotection induced by repeated EA preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rats were pretreated with naltrindole (NTI), nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) or<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29996"> D-Phe</z:chebi>-Cys-Tyr<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29955,32725">-D-Trp</z:chebi><z:chebi fb="6" ids="44548">-Orn</z:chebi>-Thr-Pen-Thr-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,29340">NH2 </z:chebi>(CTOP), which is a highly selective delta-, kappa- or micro-opioid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> respectively, before each EA preconditioning (30 minutes per day, 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the last EA treatment, the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced for 120 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was determined with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining at 24 hours after MCAO and compared with that in rats which only received EA preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another experiment, the met-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in rat brain was investigated by immunohistochemistry in both EA preconditioning and control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EA preconditioning reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared with the control rats (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of both NTI and CTOP attenuated the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction induced by EA preconditioning, presenting with larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume than that in the EA preconditioning rats (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But nor-BNI administration did not block the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume reduction induced by EA preconditioning, presenting with smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume than the control group rats (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of met-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity positive neurons in the EA preconditioning rats was more than that of the control rats (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Repeated EA preconditioning stimulates the release of enkephalins, which may bind delta- and micro-opioid receptors to induce the tolerance against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
