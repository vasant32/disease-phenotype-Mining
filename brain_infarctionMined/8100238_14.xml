<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CGP 40116 (5-40 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately following permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MK 801 (1 or 3 mg/kg i.v.), D-CPPene (20 mg/kg i.v.), and CGS 19755 (40 mg/kg i.v.) were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume was assessed using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, which in initial experiments with parallel histological determinations proved to be an accurate method for the measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and the determination of a cerebroprotective drug effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CGP 40116 dose-dependently reduced the volume of cortical infarction, with an ED50 of 11 mg/kg i.v. and a maximal effect equivalent to a 62% reduction in cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its cerebroprotective efficacy was thus comparable to that of MK 801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rank order of potency for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> was MK 801 &gt; CGP 40116 approximately D-CPPene &gt; CGS 19755 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection by CGP 40116 was still apparent when treatment was started 30 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CGP 40116 is an effective cerebroprotectant with potential clinical utility for amelioration of focal cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
