<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left middle cerebral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced for 90 min followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>JTP-2942 (0.03 or 0.003 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle) were administered for 4 weeks after 1 week <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and then the drug was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms and motor disturbance based on inclined plane test were measured once a week after 1 week <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>l-CBF and l-CGU were measured by quantitative autoradiographic technique after 6 weeks <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjacent sections subjected to l-CBF or l-CGU measurement were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-Eosin, and the infarction volume was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>JTP-2942 (0.03 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated neurological symptoms and motor disturbance at 5 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as compared with vehicle, and then after completion of drug administration, amelioration effect continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>JTP-2942 (0.03 mg/kg) also significantly ameliorated the reduced l-CBF and l-CGU in the peri-infarcted areas such as the frontal cortex, motor cortex and medial caudate-putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were noted in the infarction volume among <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates that activating reduced metabolic turnover associated with synaptic connection changes or the activation of compensation mechanisms may result in improvement of neurological symptoms and motor disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is therefore expected that JTP-2942 may be a possible therapeutic agent for motor disturbance during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
