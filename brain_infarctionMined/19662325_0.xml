<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a patient who developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, mostly involving her lower extremities, secondary to an ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> affecting the cerebellum, thalamus and midbrain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, pribedil, a dopaminergic receptor-stimulating agent, successfully improved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our case is interesting as published reports generally focus on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremors</z:hpo> limited to the upper extremities except for one reported case of Holmes' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> involving the lower extremities more severely (Walker et al. in Mov Disord 22(2):272–274, 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also demonstrates that dopaminergic receptor stimulating agents should be tested before considering invasive therapies </plain></SENT>
