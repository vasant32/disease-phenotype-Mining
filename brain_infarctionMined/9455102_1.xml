<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To prevent the atheroembolic complications such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> due to the manipulation of atherosclerotic ascending aorta during cardiac surgery, the ascending aorta of 55 patients including 6 emergencies (mean age: 67.7 +/- 6.9 years, valvular disease: n = 12, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> only or combined with valvular disease: n = 43) were evaluated with intraoperative echography as a routine, to enable a proper placement of the cannulae, clamp etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Irregular elevated lesions into the aortic lumen from the intima were identified in 7 patients (13%, mean age: 71.0 +/- 6.9 years) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, which included 2 emergent cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arch cannulation was employed in 3 patients with wide-spread lesions on the posterior wall and femoral cannulation was done in 1 patient with wide-spread lesions on the anterior wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients received CABG with in situ arterial conduits under <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, and the other 2 patients received CABG with aortic cross clamping at the lesion-free site during proximal anastomosis of vein grafts (single clamp technique) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with localized lesion were done CABG with partial aortic clamping and one of them had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recognized that manipulation of the ascending aorta has to be done with a meticulous care and well away from the diseased site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another patient with localized lesion, the arch cannulation and the single clamp technique were used 2 cm away from that lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain infarcted patient completely recovered without any sequelae and the others also had no atheroembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although calcified lesions on CT were correlated with atheromatous lesions on echogram (p = 0.004), these atheromatous plaques were not detected by enhanced CT, except in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For screening of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of ascending aorta, the CT examination was not so effective and the intraoperative echography was the most sensitive and could be easily accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in order to prevent the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149649" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atheroembolism</z:e> that might occur due to the improper manipulation of the diseased ascending aorta during usual procedures, surgical strategies have to be modified according to the position, extent and quality of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, diagnosed by intraoperative echoscanning of the aorta </plain></SENT>
