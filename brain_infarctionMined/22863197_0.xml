<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> is often detected in apparently healthy, elderly people and in different selected patient groups as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lately, several studies were carried out in order to identify the clinical conditions leading to silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A large number of clinical and paraclinical parameters were found to increase silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> prevalence, and the continuously growing list of risk factors revealed that the majority of them are similar to those related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, some consider silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> the preclinical stage of clinically overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This point of view emphasizes the early recognition and management of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>-related risk factors, and a great need for comparative studies, which could elicit the most sensitive indicators of the increased silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> risk, especially the ones that could be cost-effectively screened in the large populations as well </plain></SENT>
