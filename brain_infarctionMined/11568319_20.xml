<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the probability that regions of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> without persistent symptoms or T2 change and the settings in which these <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reversals occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging studies were selected at random from a database of 7,147 examinations to determine the probability of a pathologically decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases with decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, the clinical history was recorded and, if available, follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five cases of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reversal became known during the same period and were evaluated to determine the initial <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease, clinical outcome, and findings at follow-up imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings in 116 of 300 MR imaging studies revealed regions of decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 49 of 116 studies, follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations were performed at least 4 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms; <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> did not reverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five cases of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reversal were identified in the same period, giving an estimated 0.2%-0.4% probability of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical settings were venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (n = 3), hemiplegic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (n = 1), and hyperacute arterial infarction (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both white matter (n = 3) and gray matter (n = 3) regions were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reversal of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesions is rare, occurs in complicated clinical settings, and can involve white or gray matter </plain></SENT>
