<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to attempt an objective assessment of carotid plaque echogenicity by means of computer-aided technique and to determine the association between the echogenicity and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: 54 carotid plaques causing internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> within the range of 60 - 99% constituted the material for our studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The images of the plaques obtained by means of USG were transferred to and saved on the computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using image analysis software, a histogram of each plaque was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The grey scale median (GSM range 0 - 255) for each histogram, which was used as a measure of the plaque echogenicity, was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value of GSM was assessed in patients who suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> in the area of the stenosed artery and in patients without infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The grey scale median associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was nearly two times lower in comparison with GSM of plaques found in patients without infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 30 plaques with GSM &gt;35,only 5.5%were connected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> ,and 27.8%of the 24 plaques with GSM &lt;35 were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>.No correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was found for 50%of the plaques with GSM &gt;35 and 16.7%of the plaques with GSM &lt;35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of computer-aided method allows assessment of carotid plaque echogenicity and can be used for clinical studies aimed at evaluation of the correlation between carotid plaque type and a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
