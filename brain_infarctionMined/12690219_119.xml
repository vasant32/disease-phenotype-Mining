<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In healthy elderly people, silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions are common, but little is known about their relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with these lesions in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Rotterdam Scan Study is a population-based prospective cohort study among 1077 elderly people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions was scored on cerebral MRI scans obtained from 1995 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants were followed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for on average 4.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We estimated the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in relation to presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants (6%) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants with silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had a 5 times higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> &gt;3-fold, independently of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors (adjusted hazard ratio 3.9, 95% CI 2.3 to 6.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>People in the upper tertile of the white matter lesion distribution had an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk compared with those in the lowest tertile (adjusted hazard ratio for periventricular lesions 4.7, 95% CI 2.0 to 11.2 and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> 3.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 9.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and severe white matter lesions increased the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk independently of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly people with silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions are at a strongly increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which could not be explained by the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
