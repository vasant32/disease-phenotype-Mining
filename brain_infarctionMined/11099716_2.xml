<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the sequence of alterations in the thrombotic and fibrinolytic systems after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, we prospectively examined sequential changes in coagulatory markers in 38 patients suffering from cardioembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (CEI), 41 patients with atherothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (ATI), 58 patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LI), and 32 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma level of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrinopeptide A (FpA), D-dimer, fibrin degradation products-E (FDP-E), fibrinogen, alpha2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex (PIC), and percent activity of antithrombin III (AT-III) were measured within 48 h, at 1 week, and at 3 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly elevated levels of TAT and FpA, which are both markers of thrombin formation, were observed in CEI patients, and these elevated levels were associated with increasing D-dimer levels for 3 weeks (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>D-Dimer in CEI patients was significantly elevated compared to control, LI and ATI levels within 48 h (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percent activity of AT-III was significantly decreased in CEI patients for 3 weeks compared to this activity in controls, LI and ATI (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TAT and FpA also increased significantly within 48 h in ATI subjects and declined thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant elevation of FDP-E (P&lt;0.001) and D-dimer (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01) was detected in parallel with increasing fibrinogen for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of percent activity of AT-III in ATI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In LI subjects, no significant elevation of TAT, D-dimer or FDP-E were observed within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PIC increased significantly in three subtypes of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but did not differ significantly among the three subtypes for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An accurate assessment of sequential alterations in thrombotic and fibrinolytic markers in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> should contribute to the clinical diagnosis of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> subtype </plain></SENT>
