<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Environmental polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs) are frequently bound onto nanoparticles (NPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the toxicity and health effects of PCBs assembled onto nanoparticles are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to study the hypothesis that binding PCBs to <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> NPs potentiates PCB-induced cerebrovascular toxicity and brain damage in an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice (C57BL/6, males, 12-week-old) were exposed to PCB153 bound to NPs (PCB153-NPs), PCB153, or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCB153 was administered in the amount of 5 ng/g body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of treated animals was subjected to a 40 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, followed by a 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As compared to controls, a 24 h exposure to PCB153-NPs injected into cerebral vasculature resulted in significant elevation of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability, disruption of TJ protein expression, increased proinflammatory responses, and enhanced monocyte transmigration in mouse brain capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, exposure to PCB153-NPs increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and potentiated brain damage in mice subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A long-term (30 days) oral exposure to PCB153-NPs resulted in a higher PCB153 content in the abdominal adipose tissue and amplified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes to the brain endothelium as compared to treatment with PCB153 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first evidence that binding to NPs increases cerebrovascular toxicity of environmental toxicants, such as PCB153 </plain></SENT>
