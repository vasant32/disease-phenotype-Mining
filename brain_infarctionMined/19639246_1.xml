<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This ultimately led to the formation of a subgaleal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial operative closure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> was performed by attaching a galeal flap to the periostium surrounding the congenital defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the bony defect developed characteristics of a growing fracture later on, dural repair, transplantation of a split-bone flap and, finally, the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt became necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case affirms that stringent indication and cautious usage of vacuum-assisted delivery is strongly recommended, especially in view of the possibility that undetected congenital cranial, vascular and/or cerebral alterations may be present </plain></SENT>
