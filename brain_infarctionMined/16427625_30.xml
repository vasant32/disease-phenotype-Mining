<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to test the effects of postischemic EE on neocortical cell genesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A neocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was caused by distal ligation of the middle cerebral artery in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats, subsequently housed in standard environment or EE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered during the first postischemic week to label proliferating cells and BrdU incorporation was quantified 4 weeks later in the periinfarct, ipsilateral medial and contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to analyze co-localization of BrdU with neuronal (calbindin D28k, calretinin, parvalbumin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase), astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamine synthetase, vimentin, nestin), microglia/macrophage (CD11b/Ox-42, CD68/ED-1), oligodendrocyte progenitor/polydendrocyte (NG2, platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor) or mature oligodendrocyte (myelin basic protein) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BrdU positive cells were increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed cortical regions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> EE rats compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> standard environment rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Newly born cells in the periinfarct cortex were mostly reactive astroglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, BrdU positive cells in the periinfarct cortex that were negative for glial or microglia/macrophage markers co-expressed markers typical for interneurons but did not express appropriate functional markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of BrdU positive cells in intact cortical regions, ipsi- and contralaterally, were identified as NG2 positive polydendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perineuronally situated newly born cells and polydendrocytes were found to be brain-derived neurotrophic factor immunoreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, EE enhanced newborn glial scar astroglia and NG2+ polydendrocytes in the postischemic neocortex which might be beneficial for brain repair and poststroke plasticity </plain></SENT>
