<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The close relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) has been well-documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have focused on silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) in CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of SBI in different stages of CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 1312 participants aged 30 to 93 years who came from either a random sample of residents or from a group of physically examined subjects in the same community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basic information, clinical evaluations, laboratory tests, and MRI images were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into groups 1, 2, 3a, and 3b, corresponding to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels of ≥ 90.0, 60.0 to 89.9, 45.0 to 59.9, and 30.0 to 44.9 mL/min/1.73 m² </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The crude prevalence was 4.7%: 2.6% (20 of 759 subjects) in group 1; 6.3% (32 of 506) in group 2; 12.9% (4 of 31) in group 3a; and 37.5% (6 of 16) in group 3b (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, SBI also correlated with age, male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, moderate carotid plaque, higher blood pressures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects for SBI risk in each eGFR group versus group 1 did not increase except for group 3b (OR, 9.34; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A close association exists between SBI and eGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have found a significant increase in prevalence of SBI when eGFR is between 30.0 and 44.9 mL/min/1.73 m² </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adults with late stage 3 CKD are at high risk for prevalent SBI </plain></SENT>
