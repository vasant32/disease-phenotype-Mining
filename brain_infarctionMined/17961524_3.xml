<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which is mostly produced by the liver, has recently been shown to have the unexpected ability to modulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain function as well as brain response to injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serum IGF-I levels are modified in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether these modifications are related to the disease process remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now examined a potential relationship between serum IGF-I and ischemic brain injury after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and reperfusion in mice with either high or low serum IGF-I levels prior to insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> high serum IGF-I correlates with increased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size following MCAo, while low levels correlate with reduced lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analyses revealed that levels of phosphorylated (i.e., activated) MAPK, known to be associated with the severity of ischemic brain injury, were increased in IGF-I treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No overall effect of IGF-I treatment on IGF family <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the brain was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results indicate that serum IGF-I levels negatively correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, lowering serum IGF-I levels in aging mammals, including humans, may be beneficial against the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated to old age </plain></SENT>
