<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, cells that express the immature neuronal marker doublecortin have been found consistently in the perileisonal zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) would influence this perilesional proliferative response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Photothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were induced in the sensorimotor forelimb and hindlimb cortex of adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor or vehicle was continuously infused intraventricularly for 2 weeks after the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> using osmotic minipumps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cells were labeled by daily intraperitoneal injections of bromodeoxyuridine during the first 2 weeks and were quantified at days 14 and 42 using semiautomatic stereology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triple immunofluorescence with antibodies against immature and mature neuronal and glial markers was used to identify the proliferating cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 14 after intraventricular BNDF application, the numbers of doublecortin-positive cells were doubled in the perilesional zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 42, BDNF-treated animals had a small number of mature neurons in these areas, whereas vehicle-treated controls did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Behavioral analysis with a battery of sensorimotor tests revealed, however, that the alterations in the perilesional cellular response were not associated with an improved functional outcome </plain></SENT>
