<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An elevation in non-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> was noted in both the grey and white matter of the brain, whereas the white matter displayed a clear reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the major <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple cortical-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarctions</z:e> were found in the brain, most probably caused by compromised circulation due to endothelial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> encroachment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of cerebral blood vessels revealed major swelling of the endothelium due to prominent cytoplasmic vacuolisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles containing sparse granular or membranous matter were also seen in neurons and glial cells of the brain and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zebra bodies were found in the Purkinje cells, as well as in the spinal anterior horn cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prominent endothelial vacuolisation was noted in the liver and kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The renal vascular encroachment was probably the cause of the arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000848'>elevated plasma renin</z:hpo> activity in the present case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were innumerable fine vacuoles in the renal epithelium and in the Kupffer cell of the liver, whereas coarser vacuoles were observed in the hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neuronal ultrastructural findings in the present case bear some resemblance to the few reported cases of late-infantile and adult cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">galactosialidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prominent endothelial vacuolisation and focal cerebrovascular lesions, that have not previously been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268233" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">galactosialidosis</z:e>, may be features specific to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> early-infantile form </plain></SENT>
