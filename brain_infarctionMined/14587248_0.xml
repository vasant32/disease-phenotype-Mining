<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 103 patients, their mean age 58-66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 16 patients, of matching age and sex, with radicular lesions of discal origin, subjected to diagnostic radiculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentration of neuron-specific enolase was measured by a flouroimmunometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the concentration of neuron-specific enolase in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of patients with brain ischemic disease within first seven days significantly increased compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest increase of concentration was established in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, somewhat lower in reversible ischemic attack, and the lowest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal concentration was established on the 3rd-4th day upon the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuron-specific enolase concentration in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma may be an indicator of pathophysiological processes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and is significant in early diagnostics and therapy of the disease </plain></SENT>
