<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) was used to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain content of N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52392">2-arachidonoylglycerol</z:chebi> were determined during MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole brain AEA content was significantly increased after 30, 60 and 120 min MCAo compared with sham-operated brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in AEA was localized to the ischemic hemisphere after 30 min MCAo, but at 60 and 120 min, was also increased in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52392">2-Arachidonoylglycerol</z:chebi> content was unaffected by MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second set of studies, injury was assessed 24 h after 2 h MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats administered a single dose (3 mg/kg) of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SR141716 prior to MCAo exhibited a 50% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and a 40% improvement in neurological function compared with vehicle control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second CB1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, LY320135 (6 mg/kg), also significantly improved neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CB1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, WIN 55212-2 (0.1-1 mg/kg) did not affect either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or neurological score </plain></SENT>
