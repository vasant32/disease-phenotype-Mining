<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transport of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) across the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) is negligible in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, BDNF might pass through the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> when <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> is disrupted by a pathological condition such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This migration of BDNF through the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> might be important during post-ischemic phase since BDNF can exert a protective action in the site of lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate plasma levels of BDNF in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial venous blood samples were taken in ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the admission to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit and on the following 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the same samples we also evaluated the plasma levels of S100beta protein, a marker of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in BDNF plasma levels in our patients, even in the presence of a pronounced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> dysfunction, as demonstrated by a significant increase of S100beta protein concentrations at days 2 and 3 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data, though indirectly, suggest that there is no significant increase in endogenous extracellular BDNF after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
