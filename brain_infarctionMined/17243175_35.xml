<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic processes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, can enhance neurogenesis, as can growth factors and other physiologic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic and neuroprotective growth factor that can promote neurogenesis, but it is unknown whether VEGF can enhance migration of newborn neurons toward sites of ischemic injury, where they might be able to replace neurons that undergo ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we produced permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed with bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) labeling and immunostaining for cell type-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In VEGF-Tg mice, brains examined 7-28 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> showed markedly increased subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis, chains of neuroblasts extending from the SVZ to the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex, and an increase in the number of newly generated cortical neurons at 14-28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In concert with these effects, VEGF overexpression reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved postischemic motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence that VEGF increases SVZ neurogenesis and neuromigration, consistent with a possible role in repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that in addition to its neuroprotective effects, which are associated with improved outcome in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, VEGF enhances postischemic neurogenesis, which could provide a therapeutic target for more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> brain repair </plain></SENT>
