<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MetS was diagnosed using criteria proposed by the Japanese study group for the definition of MetS in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MetS in patients studied was higher in males (45.9%) than females (28.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MetS was 53.0% in males and 35.4% in females in patients with duration of less than 10 years, and decreased with an increase in duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon comparing patients groups complicated with and without MetS, we determined the MetS group had significantly higher levels of fasting serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and a significantly lower level of serum adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> was not significantly different between these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> in the group with MetS was significantly higher than in that without MetS, and became significantly higher along with an increase in duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study clarifies the prevalence of MetS in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, and suggests that MetS is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e> in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
