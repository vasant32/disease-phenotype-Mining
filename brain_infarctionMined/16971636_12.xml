<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) are reversible or correspond to permanent tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 103 consecutive patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 36 (34.9%) had abnormalities on initial DWI (delay from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> = 30 +/- 33 hours [mean +/- SD]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (59 DWI lesions) had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging follow-up (delay from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> = 10.6 +/- 5 months) including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T2, DWI, and 3D T1-weighted sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each lesion, we recorded the quantitative parameters on initial DWI (volume, apparent diffusion coefficient [<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>]) and performed a comparison between reversible and irreversible lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging failed to detect any permanent injury in 7 patients and identified subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in regions corresponding to the original DWI abnormalities in 26 patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 59 lesions initially identified on DWI, 45 (76.3%) were associated with permanent injury on follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DWI volume was significantly larger (0.91 +/- 1.7 versus 0.21 +/- 0.21 cm(3), P = .003) and the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio values lower (79 +/- 15% versus 91 +/- 9%, P = .001) in lesions with subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> than in those that were fully reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By showing that most patients with DWI-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> share the same imaging outcome as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, our data provide additional support for the redefinition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, which considers that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of transient deficit with characteristic neuroimaging abnormalities should be diagnosed as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
