<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method was applied to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-2-fluoro-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> (FDG) studies, and images of local blood volume, kinetic rate constants, precursor pool volume and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noise reduction and contrast preservation was demonstrated in a simulated pie phantom and a study of a patient with a recent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considerably improvement in quantitative accuracy of pixel parameter values was observed in the phantom study in comparison with unprocessed or conventionally smoothed images </plain></SENT>
