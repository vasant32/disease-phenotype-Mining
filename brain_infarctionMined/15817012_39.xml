<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis, average follow-up time: 4.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: CHS participants with modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) score of 80 or greater, no self-reported disability, no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and at least one assessment of mobility (n=2,450, mean age=74.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Brain MRI abnormalities (ventricular enlargement, white matter hyperintensities, subcortical and basal ganglia <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>), self-reported physical impairment (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty walking</z:hpo> half a mile or with one or more activities of daily living), and motor performance (gait speed, timed chair stand) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and diseases, risk of incident self-reported physical impairment was 35% greater for those with severe ventricular enlargement than for those with minimal ventricular enlargement, 22% greater for those with moderate white matter hyperintensities than for those with minimal white matter hyperintensities, and 26% greater for participants with at least one brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> than for those with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with moderate to severe brain abnormalities experienced faster gait speed decline (0.02 m/s per year) than those with no MRI abnormalities (0.01 m/s per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 3MS score did not substantially attenuate hazard ratios for incident self-reported physical impairment or coefficients for decline in gait speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subclinical structural brain abnormalities in high-functioning older adults can increase the risk of developing physical disabilities and declining in motor performance </plain></SENT>
