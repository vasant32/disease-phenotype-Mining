<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several inflammatory biomarkers, and particularly high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), have been identified as likely predictors of the risk of a future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In clinical settings, it has been consistently observed that higher concentrations of CRP are associated with larger brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, neurologic disability, and future vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there is still controversy over the degree of risk conferred by elevated CRP concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some studies reported that the predictive value of CRP is moderate compared with classical risk factors and is only weakly related to cardiovascular damage after adjustment for traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRP like many other hemostatic factors is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase protein and, therefore, it is not always clear whether its association with cerebrovascular disease reflects its contribution to atherothrombosis, its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase condition, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the value of single measurements of CRP in patients with concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or other inflammatory conditions has not been established and reported data should be interpreted cautiously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several drugs, especially hydroxymethylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>), have been demonstrated to reduce hsCRP levels independently of their effects on plasma cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently, emerging therapies have been aimed at the control of blood pressure and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether a reduction of hsCRP levels could be beneficial to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients remains to be clarified, and it is also unclear whether other drugs may be useful to lower hsCRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed before hsCRP becomes a routine part of the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This should also prompt the search for new agents directly blocking CRP actions </plain></SENT>
