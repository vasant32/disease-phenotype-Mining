<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined changes in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to see if there might be a correlation between these and the patient's clinical state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured plasma levels of 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol in 32 control subjects and in 50 patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and 57 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> who were admitted to the hospital within 72 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we estimated 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and eight control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> values for plasma 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol in the patients with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were 7.3 +/- 0.5 and 6.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both values were significantly higher than that obtained in the 32 control subjects (4.6 +/- 0.3 ng/ml, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol correlated well with state of consciousness and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> level of 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol in the cerebrospinal fluid of the 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (10.9 +/- 0.6 ng/ml) was also significantly higher than that in the eight control patients (7.9 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed increase in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of 3-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-4-hydroxyphenylglycol implies that the activity of the central noradrenergic neurons may be enhanced at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and these levels may be related to some extent to the clinical state and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
