<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (AIS), a severe cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis may remain and increase the risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not well known whether CEA can be performed safely after thrombolysis, and, if so, when </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a prospective study of CEA for residual high-grade cervical ICA stenosis performed within 15 days after IVT for AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One day after IVT in neurovascular unit, computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed to assess the brain and the patency of cervical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CEA was performed on neurologically stable patients after full cerebral artery re-canalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was controlled with particular caution before and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 2005 and January 2008, we operated consecutively on 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was 12 (range: 5-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined intracranial (ICA)-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion was present in 58.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms until CEA was 8 days (range: 1-16 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 30 days was 8.3% (one nonfatal haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 90 days, nine patients had a Rankin score of 0-1, one had a score of 2 and two had a score of 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with residual cervical ICA stenosis after IVT, we achieved full patency of the occluded artery and good functional prognosis at 3 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We advocate for an extremely close monitoring of the blood pressure in the pre-, peri- and post-operative course and a close collaboration between neurologist and surgeon to determine the best timing for CEA </plain></SENT>
