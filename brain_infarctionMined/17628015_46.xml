<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), originally identified as an architectural nuclear protein, exhibits an inflammatory cytokine-like activity in the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that treatment with neutralizing anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 200 microg, twice) remarkably ameliorated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> induced by 2-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats, even when the mAb was administered after the start of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the 90% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, the accompanying neurological deficits in locomotor function were significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-HMGB1 mAb inhibited the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, the activation of microglia, the expression of TNF-alpha and iNOS, and suppressed the activity of MMP-9, whereas it had little effect on blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injection of HMGB1 increased the severity of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study revealed that HMGB1 immunoreactivity in the cell nuclei decreased or disappeared in the affected areas, suggesting the release of HMGB1 into the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that HMGB1 plays a critical role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> through the amplification of plural <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> in the ischemic region and could be an outstandingly suitable target for the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAb provides a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
