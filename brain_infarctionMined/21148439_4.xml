<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: regaining functional independence is an important goal for people who have experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that introducing earlier and more intensive out-of-bed activity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> would reduce time to unassisted walking and improve independence in activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: a Very Early Rehabilitation Trial (AVERT) was a phase II randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>) admitted &lt;24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and who met physiological safety criteria were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients randomized to the very early and intensive mobilization group were mobilized within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and at regular intervals thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control patients received standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome for this analysis was the number of days required to return to walking 50 m unassisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were the Barthel Index and Rivermead Motor Assessment at 3 and 12 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: seventy-one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a mean age of 74.7 years were recruited from 2 hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjusted Cox regression indicated that very early and intensive mobilization group patients returned to walking significantly faster than did standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit care controls (P=0.032; median 3.5 vs 7.0 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression revealed that exposure to very early and intensive mobilization was independently associated with good functional outcome on the Barthel Index at 3 months (P=0.008) and on the Rivermead Motor Assessment at 3 (P=0.050) and 12 (P=0.024) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: earlier and more intensive mobilization after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may fast-track return to unassisted walking and improve functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical Trial Registration- This trial was not registered because enrollment began before July 2005 </plain></SENT>
