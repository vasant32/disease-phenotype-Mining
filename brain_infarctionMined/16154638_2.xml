<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We showed previously that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in ovo impairs memory consolidation in the chick tested 2 days after hatching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our present aim was to investigate whether we could detect any morphological effects of the same prenatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> was induced by half-wrapping the egg with an impermeable membrane from either days 10-18 (W10-18 chicks) or days 14-18 (W14-18 chicks) of incubation (hatching approximately 21 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurement of blood gases showed that reducing the surface area of the egg for gas exchange resulted in reduced pO2 and increased pCO2 2 days after wrapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was sufficient to impair cognitive processing in the postnatal chick, our data suggest that it did not produce overt structural alterations or changes in the number of neurons, glutamine synthetase-immunoreactive cells or immunoreactivity to synaptophysin in the presynaptic vesicles in the multimodal integration (cortical) area compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, we found no differences in the astrocyte to neuron ratio, synaptic density and/or vesicle number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the ontogeny of astrocytes during the prenatal period of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> showed them to be present at embryonic day 12, but not at the earlier ages examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although we found <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in chicks from embryos made hypoxic during incubation, our regimen of prenatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> did not alter any of the parameters measured in the brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This does not preclude the possibility that changes have occurred at the cellular or molecular levels or in specific neurotransmitter systems </plain></SENT>
