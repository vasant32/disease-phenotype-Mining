<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (SBI) are common findings in advanced age, but their relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate whether SBI predict the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after first clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We blindly studied admission CT scans of 175 consecutive nondemented patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> that clinically was their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SBI were defined as CT evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> not compatible with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were subsequently followed for their mental state for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis, wherein <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was the end point, was performed on the total sample population and conducted separately on those with and without SBI at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> developed in 56 patients (32%), including 22 of the 63 (35%) with SBI and 34 of the 112 (30%) without SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was not related to SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SBI do not predict the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
