<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fast FLAIR and fast SE images were obtained in 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infarctions close to the sulci were difficult to differentiate from the real sulci on fast SE images, but were clearly depicted on FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear foci along with cortex were especially well demonstrated on FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, foci that showed high signal intensity on fast SE images were sometimes appeared as having low or iso signal intensity on FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These foci, suspected of being cystic lesions, were sometimes difficult to identify on fast FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the above reasons, we concluded that fast FLAIR and fast SE each have advantages and disadvantages in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
