<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 50% of silent infarction and in 53.3% of symptomatic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was more frequent in symptomatic infarction than silent infarction (28.3% vs 16.7%) and the control of the blood pressure was very poor even if the patients with symptomatic infarction was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
