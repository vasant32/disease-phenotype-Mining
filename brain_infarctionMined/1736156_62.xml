<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the influence of time of recanalization or degree of initial leptomeningeal collateral blood flow in cardioembolic or arterio-arterial middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and clinical outcome in a series of 34 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with main stem (N = 31) or major branch (N = 3) occlusions using CT, initial cerebral arteriography (N = 21), repetitive close-meshed transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and a neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated 15 patients with tissue plasminogen activator intravenously within the first 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The type and size of infarction depended on the location of the occluding lesions within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion always led to infarction involving the striatum and internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent of patients showed recanalization of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization, hyperperfusion was present in 38 to 44% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a marginally significant relation between size of infarction on CT and recanalization time within the first 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The more rapidly recanalization occurred, the smaller the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When recanalization time was greater than 8 hours, the lesions always extended to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An additional good leptomeningeal collateral blood flow significantly reduced the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and improved clinical outcome after 17 days and after 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization of embolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions within up to 8 hours, in conjunction with good transcortical collateralization, has a favorable impact on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and outcome and may constitute the therapeutic window of opportunity </plain></SENT>
