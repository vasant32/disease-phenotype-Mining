<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were exposed to 10 min <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and normoxia until severe damage developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As indices of damage, whole striatal tissue impedance (reflecting cellular water uptake), <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> contents (due to exchange with blood) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evans Blue staining (blood-brain barrier [<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>] integrity) and silver staining (increased in irreversibly damaged neurons) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A substantial decrease in blood pressure was observed during the hypoxic periods possibly producing severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Irreversibly increased impedance, massive changes in silver staining, accumulation of whole tissue Na and loss of K occurred only after a minimum of two periods of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, but there was no disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of tissue sections revealed that cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was selective with reversible impedance changes, but became massive and non-specific after irreversible increase of the impedance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> could, however, not be predicted from measurements of physiological parameters in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> during repetitive periods of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> may serve as a model for the development of brain damage in a variety of clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the present model allows the screening of potential therapeutic measuring of the prevention and treatment of both infarction and selective cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
