<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aged male Fischer rats (18 months old) had an intracaudate injection of 100 Î¼L autologous blood and were treated with DFX or vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were euthanized at day 56 and brains were perfused for histology and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining was used to examine <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> cavity presence and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed to measure the number of cells positive for ferritin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and OX-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In aged rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, a cavity formed in the caudate in 7 out of 12 vehicle-treated rats and 1 out of 9 DFX-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DFX treatment significantly reduced the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>-induced cavity (p&lt;0.05) as well as neurological deficits (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DFX also reduced the number of ferritin (p&lt;0.05) and HO-1 (p&lt;0.01) positive cells in the ipsilateral basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, DFX had no effect on brain GFAP and OX-6 immunoreactivity 2 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>.In conclusion, DFX reduces cavity size, neurological deficits, and immunoreactivity for ferritin and HO-1 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in aged rats, supporting the suggestion that DFX may reduce brain injury in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
