<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to study if the connectivity of fetal neocortical tissue blocks placed in ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of adult rats would be enhanced in rats housed in an enriched environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether the enriched housing conditions could enhance the postischemic and postgrafting functional outcome, in terms of motor behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This part of the study has been published recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was ligated on the right side in 37 inbred, adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were placed at random either in an enriched environment (groups A and B) or in standard laboratory cages (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, blocks of fetal sensorimotor cortex (embryonic day 17) were transplanted into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cavity of rats from groups B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 9 weeks <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transplanted rats received an injection, into the graft, of a mixture containing the two tracers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53251">Fluoro-Gold</z:chebi> and biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transplants revealed a structured <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with whorls and bands of cells reminiscent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tracing of efferent transplant to host fibers with biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> showed pronounced intrinsic transplant projections, as well as fibers, although significantly fewer, to the host ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, striatum, and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Host to transplant projections were revealed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53251">Fluoro-Gold</z:chebi>-labeled cells found in the ipsilateral host sensorimotor cortex, the basal nucleus of Meynert, the thalamic ventrobasal, ventrolateral and posterior nuclei, and in the dorsal raphe nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that fetal frontal neocortical block grafts placed in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of adult rats develop a <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> reminiscent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neocortex and that both afferent and efferent neural connections, although sparse, are established with the host brain, whether the rats are reared under enriched housing conditions or not </plain></SENT>
