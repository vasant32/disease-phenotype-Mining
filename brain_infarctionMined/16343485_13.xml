<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adrenomedullin (AM) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> widely distributed in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous study showed that AM gene delivery immediately after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) protected against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury by promoting glial cell survival and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of delayed AM <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> infusion on ischemic brain injury at 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AM infusion significantly reduced neurological deficit scores at days 2, 4, and 8 after cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AM reduced cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 8 and 15 days after surgery as determined by quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double staining showed that AM infusion reduced TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in both neurons and glial cells, as well as reduced caspase-3 activity in the ischemic area of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, AM treatment increased capillary density in the ischemic region at 15 days after I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parallel studies revealed that AM treatment enhanced the proliferation of cultured endothelial cells as measured by both (3)H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation and in situ BrdU labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro and in vivo AM effects were blocked by calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (8-37), an AM receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, AM's effects were associated with increased cerebral nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) levels, as well as decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase activities and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a continuous supply of exogenous AM <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> protects against I/R injury by improving the survival of neuronal and glial cells, and promoting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> through elevated NO formation and suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
