<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a young female with cervicalgia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> with fatal posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> after CSMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serious complications are infrequent, with a reported incidence between one per 100,000 to one in 2 million manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent injuries involve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> or spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> as a complication of cervical manipulation and dissection of the vertebral arteries (VAD) is a rare but well recognized problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neck pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> are typical symptoms of VAD, but this vascular injury also can be asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common risk factors are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, oral contraceptive pills and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> following CSMT is more common than the literature reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best values derive from retrospective surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lack of identifiable risk factors place those who undergo CSMT at risk of neurologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accurate patient information and early recognition of the symptoms are important to avoid catastrophic consequences </plain></SENT>
