<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that surgical obliteration of the cerebral veins with additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009592" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain compression</z:e> by retractors is dangerous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the mechanism, we studied the change in cerebral microcirculation and parenchymal damage following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009592" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain compression</z:e> with venous circulatory impairment using a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into the following four groups (each n = 5) (1) a sham-operated control; (2) group A, one cortical vein occlusion; (3) group B, a 30 mmHg compression pressure; and (4) group C, one cortical vein occlusion with 30 mmHg compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cortical vein was occluded photochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow (l-CBF) in the compressed area was measured by stationary laser-Doppler (LD) flowmetry and regional CBF (r-CBF) in the surrounding area was also measured by LD scanning technique for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>l-CBF in the compressed area decreased significantly in groups B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A gradual and significant increase in group B and decrease in group C in r-CBF of the surrounding area were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, more extensive damage was observed in group C than in group A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of hypoperfusion of the affected brain correlated well with the subsequent brain damage in the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that, compared with vein occlusion or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009592" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain compression</z:e> alone, the accumulated episode caused severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, then increased the vulnerability of the rat brain to tissue damage </plain></SENT>
