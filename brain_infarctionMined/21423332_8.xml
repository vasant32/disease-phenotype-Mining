<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each series described below, SD rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In series 1, DHA or saline was administered i.v. at 3, 4, 5, or 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In series 2, MRI was conducted on days 1, 3 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In series 3, DHA or saline was administered at 3 h, and lipidomic analysis was conducted on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with DHA significantly improved behavior and reduced total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by a mean of 40% when administered at 3 h, by 66% at 4 h, and by 59% at 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total lesion volumes computed from T2-weighted images were reduced in the DHA group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lipidomic analysis showed that DHA treatment potentiates neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) synthesis in the penumbra 3 days after MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DHA administration provides neurobehavioral recovery, reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and activates NPD1 synthesis in the penumbra when administered up to 5 h after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
