<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were collected at autopsy from human brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain tumours</z:e>, removed during surgical procedure (Neurological and Neurosurgical Clinic, Cracow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel, unexpected finding were VCAM-1-positive fibrous astrocytes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> tissue, and astrocyte-like cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No staining was obtained either in the contralateral hemisphere or outside of ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, no positive staining of cells was seen outside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The above findings, taken together, strongly support the concept that astrocytes take part in the immune defense during various pathological processes in the human brain </plain></SENT>
