<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)δ in the cerebral vasculature following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report a novel finding that selective PPARδ genetic deletion in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) resulted in increased cerebrovascular permeability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in mice after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, we revealed for the first time that PPARδ expression is reduced, but matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity is increased in cultured VSMCs after oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and also in the cerebral cortex of mice following MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, gain- and loss of PPARδ function in VSMCs significantly reduces and increases oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced MMP-9 activity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have further identified that MMP-9 is a direct target of PPARδ-mediated transrepression by chromatin immunoprecipitation and PPARδ transcriptional activity assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inhibition of MMP-9 activity by lentiviral MMP-9 short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> effectively improves cerebrovascular permeability and reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in VSMC-selective PPARδ conditional knockout mice after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that PPARδ in VSMCs can prevent ischemic brain injury by inhibition of MMP-9 activation and attenuation of postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pharmacological activation of PPARδ may provide a new therapeutic strategy to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced vascular and neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
