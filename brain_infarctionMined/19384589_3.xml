<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although some of the COX-2 metabolites and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> have been implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and excitotoxicity, the role of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F(2alpha) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2alpha)) and its FP receptor have not been elucidated in the pathogenesis of ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the FP receptor's contribution in a unilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) and FP knockout (FP(-/-)) C57BL/6 male mice was transiently occluded with a monofilament for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 96 h of reperfusion, the FP(-/-) mice had 25.3% less neurological deficit (P &lt; 0.05) and 34.4% smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (P &lt; 0.05) than those of the WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a separate cohort, physiological parameters were monitored before, during, and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and the results revealed no differences between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because excitotoxicity is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mediator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome, the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity was also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after unilateral intrastriatal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> injection, excitotoxic brain damage was 20.8% less extensive in the FP(-/-) mice (P &lt; 0.05) than in the WT counterparts, further supporting the toxic contribution of the FP receptor in I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we investigated the effect of post-treatment with the FP <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi> in mice subjected to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion; such treatment resulted in an increase in neurological deficit and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in WT mice (P &lt; 0.05), though no effects were observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi>-treated FP(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, the results suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>(2alpha) FP receptor significantly enhances cerebral ischemic and excitotoxic brain injury and that these results are of importance when planning for potential development of therapeutic drugs to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and/or long term consequences </plain></SENT>
