<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It remains unknown whether the prevalence of silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> increases as renal function declines or what factors known as atherosclerotic risk factors are related to the development of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 80 patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The existence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was evaluated on brain magnetic resonance imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by means of intima-media thickness of 1.0 mm or greater height in bilateral carotid arteries and by affecting factors, including plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lacunae prevalence was 25% in patients with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (Ccr) greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2, 85% in patients with a Ccr less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 29% in patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with lacunae had significantly lower hematocrits associated with increased fibrinogen and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) levels compared with those without lacunae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and insulin levels at 2 hours after a 75-g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test correlated significantly with lacunae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic heart changes shown by electrocardiogram and thickened carotid intima-media thickness were significantly more frequent in patients with lacunae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, logistic regression analysis showed that the most strongly contributing factor for lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was decline in Ccr (confidence interval, 0.933 to 0.995; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>Decreased renal function</z:hpo>, even without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, is a risk factor for silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
