<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 480 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases, 330 (69%) were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In univariate analysis, low scores on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) and on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test as well as declines in scores over time prior to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high ventricular grade on the MRI (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>) as well as high white matter grade, a number of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on the MRI were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E epsilon4 (Apo(E-4)) was also a powerful predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model controlling for race, gender and grade, the hazard ratios for age (1.1), 3MSE score (0.9), ventricular size (1.4), white matter grade (1.8), presence of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> &gt;3 mm (1.3) and Apo(E-4) (2.1) were significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of an Apo(E-4) genotype, 3MSE score &lt;90, &gt; or =5 ventricular grade, &gt; or =3 white matter grade at the time of the MRI were associated with a 17-fold increased risk (95% CI: 8.6-34.9) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as compared to individuals with none of the above attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measures of cognition, Apo(E-4) and MRI of the brain are strong predictors of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and of AD </plain></SENT>
