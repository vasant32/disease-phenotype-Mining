<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) exhibits inflammatory cytokine-like activity in the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that intravenous injection of anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) remarkably ameliorated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we focused on the protective effects of the mAb on the marked translocation of HMGB1 in the brain, the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), and the resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the rat was used as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated with anti-HMGB1 mAb or control IgG intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability was measured by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructure of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> unit was observed by transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> system was used to study the direct effects of HMGB1 in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HMGB1 was time-dependently translocated and released from neurons in the ischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mAb reduced the edematous area on T2-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that the mAb strongly inhibited astrocyte end feet swelling, the end feet detachment from the basement membrane, and the opening of the tight junction between endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro reconstituted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> system, recombinant HMGB1 increased the permeability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> with morphological changes in endothelial cells and pericytes, which were inhibited by the mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the anti-HMGB1 mAb facilitated the clearance of serum HMGB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the anti-HMGB1 mAb could be an effective therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> by inhibiting the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> through the protection of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and the efficient clearance of circulating HMGB1 </plain></SENT>
