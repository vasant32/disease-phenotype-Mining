<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The female hormone <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> has been shown to promote synaptogenesis; the purpose of this study was to attempt to harness these mechanisms to promote repair and recovery in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were ovariectomized, tested for sensorimotor function, and the middle cerebral artery permanently occluded (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were calculated using MRI, and damage was equivalent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals prior to implantation of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> or placebo pellets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were tested for functional recovery for 28 days and tissue processed for synaptic marker syntaxin immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced a significant behavioral deficit, which persisted out to 28 days, and was not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> and placebo treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in syntaxin immunostaining between groups in either the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cortex or in the dendritic CA1 reference region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> treatment, delivered poststroke, did not influence recovery of function or synaptogenesis </plain></SENT>
