<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NIRS can detect ischemic changes during CEA; however, possible watershed-type perfusion defects may not be detected by single-channel NIRS occurring at some distance from the light source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present case, we tested the usefulness of optical topography (ie, multichannel NIRS, OT) for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient (64-year-old man) exhibited nonsymptomatic 80% stenosis of the right ICA with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CEA was performed to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used single-channel NIRS and OT for monitoring of perfusion changes during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optodes of OT were placed on the skull to cover the frontal and parietal lobes on the right side, whereas the sensor of the single-channel NIRS was placed on the right forehead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The single-channel NIRS detected no significant perfusion changes during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the OT revealed occurrence of watershed-type perfusion defects in the border region between the right middle and posterior cerebral artery supply areas during cross-clamping of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative MRI showed an ischemic region which corresponded to the area associated with the perfusion defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: OT could detect watershed-type posterior perfusion defects which the single-channel NIRS failed to detect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OT may represent a useful tool for intraoperative monitoring during CEA </plain></SENT>
