<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Chinese herbal formula composed of Poria cocos (Chinese name: Fu Ling), Atractylodes macrocephala (Chinese name: Bai Zhu) and Angelica sinensis (Chinese names: Danggui, Dong quai, Donggui; Korean name: Danggwi) (FBD), has been proved to be beneficial in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R).This study was carried out to evaluate the protective effect of FBD against neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat I/R were established by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 1 h, followed by 24 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO led to significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and rise in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LPO) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were also significantly elevated by MCAO as compared with sham-operated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and damage were significantly attenuated by 7 days pretreatment with the aqueous extract of FBD (250 mg kg(-1), p.o.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid sampled from FBD-pretreated rats protected PC12 cells against oxidative insult induced by 0.2 mM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, in a concentration and time-dependent manner (IC(50) 10.6%, ET(50) 1.2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, aqueous extract of FBD just slightly scavenged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18421">superoxide anion radical</z:chebi> generated in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase system (IC(50) 2.4 mg ml(-1)) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> generated in Fenton reaction system (IC(50) 3.6 mg ml(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, FBD was a distinct <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> phytotherapy to rescue neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, through blocking LPO, restoring endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system, but not scavenging free radicals </plain></SENT>
