<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE AND METHODS: One-hundred-and-nine consecutive patients admitted during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of a CT-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Putative adverse influence of demographic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, previous medical history, clinical presentation, initial and follow-up neurological examination, initial general evaluation, laboratory findings, chest X-ray and electrocardiographic findings, treatment, and topography and etiology of the ischemic insult was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The end-point for assessment was early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (within 30 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with univariate analysis and multiple regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main adverse factors related to an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk during the first 30 days were, in decreasing order of importance: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> 48-72 hours after admission; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring in already hospitalized patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo> on admission; minor degrees of impairment of consciousness 48-72 hours after admission; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> related to large artery atherothrombosis and to embolism; a history of early impairment of consciousness; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 53 lucid patients on admission, only a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) was associated with a <z:mp ids='MP_0008770'>reduced survival rate</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 56 patients with impaired consciousness, the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo> increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk, but the main factor predicting a high case-fatality rate was the persistence of consciousness disturbances after 48-72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of impairment of consciousness, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, 2-3 days after disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> greatly increase the early case fatality rate in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BI presenting with or without consciousness disturbances at admission, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of a prognostic algorythm considering these few variables seems to predict the approximate 30-day fatality rates </plain></SENT>
