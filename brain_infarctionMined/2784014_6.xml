<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the central and peripheral areas described earlier in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> period were already differentiated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peripheral area showed both a slight regional cerebral blood flow decrease and an early <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> uptake decrease similar to those previously found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
