<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the infiltration of T cells into the brain, as well as the cytokines interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-17, have pivotal roles in the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and accompanying neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blockade of T cell infiltration into the brain by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> FTY720 reduced I/R-induced brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-23, which was derived mostly from infiltrated macrophages, increased on day 1 after I/R, whereas IL-17 levels were elevated after day 3, and this induction of IL-17 was dependent on IL-23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data, together with analysis of mice genetically disrupted for IL-17 and IL-23, suggest that IL-23 functions in the immediate stage of I/R brain injury, whereas IL-17 has an important role in the delayed phase of I/R injury during which apoptotic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurs in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular cytokine staining revealed that gammadeltaT lymphocytes, but not CD4(+) helper T cells, were a major source of IL-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of gammadeltaT lymphocytes ameliorated the I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that T lymphocytes, including gammadeltaT lymphocytes, could be a therapeutic target for mitigating the inflammatory events that amplify the initial damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
