<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging, there were T2-hyperintense and T1-hypointense, noncontrast enhancing lesions in the cerebellum, and brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), the lesions were characterized initially by restricted water diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presumptive diagnosis on each occasion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> leading to infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This allowed us to characterize the changes in appearance of infarcted neural tissue on the standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sequences over time, and to confirm that the DWI could be successfully used in low-field imaging.
