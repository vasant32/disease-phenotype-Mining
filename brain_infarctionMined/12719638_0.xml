<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 79-year-old female with visual <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the left posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She could recognize objects used in daily life rather well by touch (the number of objects correctly identified was 16 out of 20 presented objects), but she could not recognize them as well by vision (6 out of 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case, it was expected that she would recognize them well when permitted to use touch and vision simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patient, however, performed poorly, producing 5 correct answers out of 20 in the Vision-and-Touch condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It would be natural to think that visual capture functions when vision and touch provide contradictory information on concrete positions and shapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the present case, it functioned in spite of the visual deficit in recognizing objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This should be called radical visual capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By presenting detailed descriptions of her symptoms and neuropsychological and neuroradiological data, we clarify the characteristics of this type of capture </plain></SENT>
