<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) is still used as a covering term to indicate the relationship between cerebrovascular disease and the progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of white matter changes (WMCs), seen with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> had not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">Cobalt</z:chebi>-55 (55Co) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) allows us to distinguish between recent and old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purpose: The present study investigates whether 55Co PET can detect the lesions responsible for the progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorder</z:e> in VaD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 consecutive patients with a previous history of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurring more than 6 months before and with multiple cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, lacunes and WMCs on CT and 5 age-matched controls were investigated with 55Co PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were divided in two groups: 8 with and 12 without VaD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average 55Co counts in cerebral cortex, deep gray nuclei and white matter were compared to the value in the cerebellum used as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group, the 55Co uptake was identical in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum, but lower in the deep gray nuclei and the cerebral white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When comparing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups with the control, the 55Co uptake was similar for the cerebral cortex and deep gray nuclei, but significantly increased in the cerebral white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 55Co uptake was also more increased in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group with VaD compared to the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 55Co PET shows that the WMCs are due to the ongoing damage of probably ischaemic origin which is more prominent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>progressive cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
