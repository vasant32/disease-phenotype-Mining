<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For time-window assessment, male Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with 0.2 mg/kg VELCADE at 1, 2, or 3 h after the induction of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) using the suture occlusion method (experiment 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate effects in a different model, male Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.2 mg/kg VELCADE after embolic MCAO (experiment 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated based on TTC-staining 24 h postischemia and whole blood proteasome activity was fluorometrically determined in both experiments at baseline, 1 and 24 h post-MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, a dose of 0.2 mg/kg inhibited proteasome activity by 77% and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was reduced to 175.7+/-59.9 mm3 and 205.9+/-83.9 mm3 (1 and 2 h group, respectively; p&lt;0.05) compared to 306.5+/-48.5 mm3 (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment at 3 h was not neuroprotective (293.0+/-40.1 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After embolic MCAO, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 167.5+/-90.7 mm3 (treatment group) and 398.9+/-141.3 mm3 (control; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, VELCADE treatment inhibited whole blood proteasome activity and achieved significant neuroprotection in two rat models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> at various time points poststroke </plain></SENT>
