<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An individual with a positive family history of a disease may be at increased risk for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine whether parental history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is associated with subclinical or clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, and whether any observed association is independent of established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Parental history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was determined by home interview at the baseline examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI was performed on individuals from 2 ARIC field centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subclinical cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cases (n=202) were defined by the presence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> &gt;3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The comparison group for the subclinical cases included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals participating in the MRI examination who were not identified as a subclinical case (n=1533) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was determined by following the ARIC cohort for potential cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two hundred sixty-one validated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were identified; 13 775 individuals from the ARIC cohort did not experience an ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Parental history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was significantly associated with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after adjusting for age, gender, and race (OR 1.67, 95% CI1.23 to 2.26) and after further adjustment for multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors (OR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>64, 95% CI1.20 to 2.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parental history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not a significant predictor of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in either adjustment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed increased risk of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among individuals with a parental history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is consistent with the expression of genetic susceptibility, a shared environment, or both in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This effect did not appear to be mediated by established <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Parental history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> does not confer an increased risk of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this sample of middle-aged Americans </plain></SENT>
