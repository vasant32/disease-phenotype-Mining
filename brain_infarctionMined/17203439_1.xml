<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Delineation of brain tissue that is at risk but not yet infarcted (penumbra) continues to be a major challenge for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolic characterization of the penumbra might be able to be achieved using blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed MRI data from 20 patients within the first 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and after 5-8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among other sequences, the MRI protocol consisted of diffusion-weighted (DWI/<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> = apparent diffusion coefficient) and quantitative T2 and T2* imaging (qT2, qT2*) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BOLD images (T2') were calculated using 1/T2' = 1/qT2* - 1/qT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BOLD lesions were rated by two blinded observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the primary blinded reading of the BOLD images, the lesion side was rated correctly by observers 1 and 2 in 80/50 % of the cases, incorrectly in 5/40 % of the cases, and rated as not visible in 15/10 % of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After unblinding the observers, the visibility was rated in 45/45 % of the cases as good, in 35/40 % of the cases as reasonable, and in 20/15 % of the cases as insufficient for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth was 0.88 (95 % confidence interval, CI 0.47 to 0.99), the specificity was 0.33 (95 % CI 0.07 to 0.70), the positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) was 0.54 (95 % CI 0.25 to 0.81), and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.75 (95 % CI 0.19 to 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth was 3.5 (95 % CI 0.20 to 115.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypo-intense lesions in BOLD imaging were visible and exceeded the lesion in diffusion-weighted imaging in most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The encouraging results justify further testing of the hypothesis that BOLD lesions, when larger than DWI lesions, are associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth from initial DWI to final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
