<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of mitoKATP channels in the penumbra area has not been studied thoroughly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a model of venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, widespread penumbra-like low flow areas are created, which are susceptible to cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we studied effects of mitoKATP channels on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to two-vein occlusion by photochemical <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of two adjacent cortical veins combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were assigned to four experimental groups pretreated intraventricularly 15 minutes before two-vein occlusion with 1) vehicle, 2) the mitoKATP channel opener <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> (2 mmol/L), 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> (2 mmol/L) plus the selective mitoKATP channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>; 100 mmol/L), or 4) 5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> alone (100 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (laser Doppler scanning) and brain cell swelling (impedance) were monitored acutely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 6.2 +/- 0.7 mm3 to 3.8 +/- 0.4 mm3, whereas regional cerebral blood flow in the vicinity of the two veins was comparable in both groups 70 minutes after two-vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> were abolished by 5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, whereas 5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> alone even increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the opening of mitoKATP channels plays a major role in brain protection under penumbra-like conditions, as shown in this venous occlusion model </plain></SENT>
