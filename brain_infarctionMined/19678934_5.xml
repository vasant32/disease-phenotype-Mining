<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In animal models, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion (IR) injury triggers membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> degradation and accumulation of lipoxidative exacerbations in neurovascular unit, leading to blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) damage and neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether impeding membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> breakdown by inhibiting secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity reduces <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage, leading to neuroprotection and functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal cerebral IR injury was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in adult male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A sPLA2 inhibitor, 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA), was administered following IR injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DEDA-treated animals were compared with vehicle-treated in terms of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> degradation and the expression/activity of sPLA2 were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of one of the sPLA2 products, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA), on the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the differentiated neuronal cell PC12 was examined by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with DEDA after IR injury not only reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> leakage but also decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurologic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment attenuated both the activity of sPLA2 and the levels of sPLA2-derived oxidized products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The metabolites of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> oxidation/peroxidation, including the protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi>, were reduced as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The treatment also restored the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, indicating attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vitro treatment of PC12 cells with DEDA did not restore the AA-mediated inhibition of neurite formation and the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, indicating that effect of DEDA is up stream to AA release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: sPLA2-derived oxidative products contribute to significant neurovascular damage, and treatment with sPLA2 inhibitor DEDA ameliorates secondary injury by reducing exacerbations from lipoxidative stress </plain></SENT>
