<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling could protect neurons against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> by increasing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>Glioma</z:hpo>-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) and patched-1 (Ptch1) are both components and transcriptional targets of the Shh pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we designed this study to determine the effect of inhibition of Shh pathway on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cyclopamine (0.18mg/kg), the classical inhibitor of Shh signaling, was stereotactic injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle immediately after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24h neurological deficit was evaluated using a modified six point scale; brain water content was measured; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was analyzed with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western Blotting and activity assay were used to analyze the expression of Gli1, Ptch1 and SOD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with Vehicle group, cyclopamine down-regulated Gli1, Ptch1 and SOD1 in pMCAO-affected brain tissue (P&lt;0.05), and increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P&lt;0.05), brain water content (P&lt;0.05) and behavioral deficits (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the present results suggest that inhibition of Shh signaling pathway exacerbated rat ischemic damage caused by pMCAO, which may be correlated with down-regulated expression of Gli1, Ptch1 and SOD1 </plain></SENT>
