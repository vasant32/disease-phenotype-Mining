<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> has been widely employed, although there is controversy as to whether calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> can be administered safely to patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion, we evaluated the effect of the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, nicardipine, on intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by an intraluminal thread method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICP was monitored continuously employing an intraparenchymal catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was reduced by infusing nicardipine intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following 6 hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, MABP was decreased by about 10 or 20% as compared to the baseline MABP with low-dose or high-dose nicardipine administration, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICP was significantly increased following reperfusion, although it did not increase further with nicardipine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Under conditions where ICP was high following reperfusion, nicardipine <z:mp ids='MP_0002843'>reduced blood pressure</z:mp> safely without increasing ICP in rats </plain></SENT>
