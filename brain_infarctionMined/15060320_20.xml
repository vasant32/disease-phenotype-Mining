<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical development of novel neuroprotection therapies for the treatment of brain injury has been unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One critical limitation is the lack of a viable therapeutic treatment window (TW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotection TW for the proteosome inhibitor MLN519 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion brain injury in rats as related to its antiinflammatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), followed by 70 hours of reperfusion and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MLN519 was administered after injury (starting 6 to 12 hours after MCAo) to evaluate the full TW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp>, neurological recovery, <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp>, and inflammatory gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Core <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in vehicle-treated rats (216+/-25 mm3) was reduced with delayed MLN519 treatments of 6, 8, or 10 hours after injury (45+/-13, 86+/-28, and 150+/-27 mm3, respectively, P&lt;0.05) and was associated with reductions in neuronal and <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MLN519-treated rats had reduced brain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of TNF-alpha (46%, P&lt;0.05), ICAM-1 (58%, P&lt;0.05), IL-6 (58%, P&lt;0.05), and E-selectin (72%, P&lt;0.05) at 24 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MLN519 treatment reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> by 32% to 80% (P&lt;0.05) in ischemic brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuroprotection treatment with MLN519 provides an extended TW of up to 10 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion brain injury, in part by attenuating the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As such, the delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001847'>brain inflammation</z:mp> after an ischemic injury offers a prime target for extending the neuroprotective TW with compounds such as MLN519, used either alone or possibly as an adjunctive therapy with thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
