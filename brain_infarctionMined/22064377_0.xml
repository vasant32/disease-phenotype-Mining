<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether genetically determined African ancestry is associated with neuropathological changes commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, we analyzed a population-based brain bank in the highly admixed city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>African ancestry was estimated through the use of previously described ancestry-informative markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk of presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, small vessel disease, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> in subjects with significant African ancestry versus those without was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were adjusted for multiple environmental risk factors, demographic variables and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>African ancestry was inversely correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with significant African ancestry (n=112, 55.4%) showed lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> in the univariate analysis (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.95, P=0.01) and when adjusted for age, sex, APOE genotype and environmental risk factors (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.89, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences for the presence of other neuropathological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show for the first time, using genetically determined ancestry, that African ancestry may be highly protective of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> neuropathology, functioning through either genetic variants or unknown environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies correlating African-American race/ethnicity with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> rates should not be interpreted as surrogates of genetic ancestry or considered to represent African-derived populations from the developing nations such as Brazil </plain></SENT>
