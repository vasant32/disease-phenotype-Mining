<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This population-based study determined the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during hospitalization and within 3 months after discharge, as well as the rates of mortality and readmission during the 3 months after discharge in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 36-month period (starting November 2007), 2200 consecutive patients (mean age, 70.6 ± 12.8 years; 49% women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> from 15 hospitals in the Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein (1 of the 16 states in Germany) were prospectively evaluated during hospitalization and a follow-up time of 3 months after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during hospitalization and 3 months after discharge, as well as readmission and mortality at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by the adjusted logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2200 patients (median time of admission, 6 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>), 24 patients (1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7%-1.5%) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during hospitalization (mean, 6 days), and of 1335 patients, 38 (2.8%; 95% CI, 2.1%-3.8%) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the 3 months after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> during hospitalization was independently correlated with male sex (OR, 3.5) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> detected by brain imaging (OR, 2.6), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 3 months correlated with age greater than 65 years (OR, 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The readmission rate (11.1%; 95% CI, 9.3%-12.7%) was increased in patients who had had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 1.7) but decreased in patients who were discharged with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> medication (OR, 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3-month mortality (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.9%-1.9%) was independently correlated with unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (OR, 2.6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) (OR, 2.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings may help clinicians to estimate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> prognosis in patients who were hospitalized early with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
