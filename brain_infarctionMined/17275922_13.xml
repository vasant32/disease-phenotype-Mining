<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the selective EP3 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> ONO-AE-248 significantly and dose-dependently increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment, pretreatment with ONO-AE-248 exacerbated the lesion caused by N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-aspartic acid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, genetic deletion of EP3 provided protection against N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-aspartic acid-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2), by stimulating EP3 receptors, can contribute to the toxicity associated with cyclooxygenase and that antagonizing this receptor could be used therapeutically to protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>- and excitotoxicity-induced brain damage </plain></SENT>
