<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is some evidence for a therapeutic effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the effect of active or sham rTMS applied to the motor area of both hemispheres in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lateral medullary infarction (LMI) or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had severe bulbar manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>11 patients had LMI, and 11 had another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were randomly allocated to receive active (n=11) or sham (n=11) rTMS of the oesophageal motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient received 300 rTMS pulses at 3 Hz and an intensity of 130% resting motor threshold to each hemisphere for five consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical ratings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and motor disability were assessed before and immediately after the last session, and then again after 1 and 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline clinical assessment of swallowing between active and sham groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Active rTMS improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> compared with sham rTMS in both groups of patients, (p=0.001 for both); the LMI group also improved the scores in the Barthel Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> improvements were maintained over 2 months of follow-up (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that rTMS could be a useful adjuvant strategy in neurorehabilitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> due to LMI or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>, although further assessment is necessary in multicentre clinical trials </plain></SENT>
