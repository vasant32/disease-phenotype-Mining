<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Framingham <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk score (FSRS) and Framingham cardiovascular risk score (FCRS) estimate the individual absolute cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and carotid plaques (CPs) are markers of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and help in the early identification of presymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to correlate Framingham risk score (FRS) with CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and CPs and evaluate their respective contribution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 510 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 510 matched controls, we calculated the FSRS and FCRS for each individual and performed carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was measured off-line at a central core laboratory, and presence of CPs was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FRS progressively increased according to tertiles of CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P for trend &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The part of the variances of FSRS and FCRS explained by CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was respectively 11% and 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationships between CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and FRS were significantly different between patients with or without CPs (P for interaction &lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With increasing CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, the 10-year FRS gradually increased between 10% and 20% in the presence of CPs and between 5% and 20% in the absence of CPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple conditional logistic regression for matched sets showed that CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, FCRS, and CPs were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, with an odds ratio of 1.68 (1.25 to 2.26; P=0.0006), 2.16 (1.57 to 2.98; P&lt;0.0001), and 2.73 (1.68 to 4.44; P&lt;0.0001), respectively, meaning that each of them may be important for evaluation of the individual cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, CPs, and FRSs correlated well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> value may help discriminate between subjects at low or high 10-year risk </plain></SENT>
