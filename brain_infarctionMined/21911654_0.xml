<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Imaging is used as a surrogate for clinical outcome in early-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth earlier than the standard 90 days used for clinical end points may be equally accurate and more practical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare assessment of the effect of reperfusion therapies using 24-hour vs day 90 magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at baseline and 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images at day 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DWI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesions were manually outlined by 2 independent raters, and the volumes were averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interrater consistency was assessed using the median difference in lesion volume between raters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients  Imaging data were available for 83 patients; 77 of these patients received thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume at 24 hours and 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 24-hour DWI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume had a strong linear correlation with day 90 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = 0.98, 95% confidence interval, 0.97-0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recanalization had a significant effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> evolution between baseline and 24 hours but not between 24 hours and day 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> growth from baseline was significantly reduced by recanalization, whether assessed at 24 hours or day 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume at either time point predicted functional outcome independent of age and baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interrater agreement was better for DWI than fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (1.4 mL [8%] vs 1.8 mL [17%]; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume using DWI at 24 hours captures the effect of reperfusion therapies on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth and predicts functional outcome similarly to imaging at day 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This has the potential to reduce loss to follow-up in trials and may add early prognostic information in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
