<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied features, coexisting causes, and recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 140 consecutive patients (mean age 44 +/- 14 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> admitted to a population-based primary-care center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected the patients from 340 patients (41%) aged &lt; or = 60 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial event was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in 118 patients (84%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 22 (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial embolic occlusions were present on angiography or transcranial Doppler in most patients admitted within 12 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, whereas a venous source was clinically apparent in only six patients (5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, Valsalva maneuver at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> were rare, but one-fourth of the patients had an interatrial septum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (ISA) that coexisted with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An alternative cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was present in only 22 patients (16%), usually cardiac (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, akinetic left ventricular segment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 3 years, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.4% per year, but only eight patients had a recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (1.9% per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This low rate of recurrence contrasted with the severity of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which left disabling sequelae in one-half the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that interatrial communication, a history of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, posterior cerebral artery territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and a coexisting cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were associated with recurrence, whereas ISA and treatment type (coagulant or antiaggregant therapy, surgical closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, given the low number of events, these findings must be taken with caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> with or without ISA is not commonly due to a coexisting cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is usually embolic, although a definite source cannot often be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is often severe, but recurrence is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of factors associated with a higher risk of recurrence in subgroups of patients is critical for the long-term management of these patients </plain></SENT>
