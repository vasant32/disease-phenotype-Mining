<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> is associated with accelerated cerebrovascular disease and an increased risk for clinically apparent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, few studies have examined the relationship between renal function and SBI, and these may have been limited by the inaccuracy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> as a renal function marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was performed among older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study to examine associations between SBI and two serum markers of renal function: Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (SCr) and cystatin C (CysC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had cranial magnetic resonance imaging and renal markers measured in 1992 to 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between renal function (estimated by 1/SCr and 1/CysC) and SBI, controlling for potential confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SBI were present in 789 (28.7%) of 2784 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A linear association with SBI was observed for 1/CysC (per 1-SD decrement; odds ratio [OR] 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 1.32; P &lt; 0.001) but not for 1/SCr (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; P = 0.14), for which a quadratic U-shaped association was suggested (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a model with both markers, 1/CysC was linearly associated with SBI (OR 1.26; P &lt; 0.001), whereas 1/SCr was not (OR 1.06; P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SBI was directly associated with quintile of CysC, whereas the association between SCr and SBI was U-shaped, with greater prevalence at high and low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, CysC, a novel marker of renal function, has a stronger and more direct association with SBI in the elderly </plain></SENT>
