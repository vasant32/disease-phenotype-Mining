<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from large vessel atherothromboembolism has a common pathogenesis, its topographic presentation is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the impact of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and location on incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> magnitude and subsequent prognosis, we evaluated the determinants of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> topography among patients with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data on 148 consecutive patients admitted over a 4-year period to a university medical center with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution on DWI, presumed due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the DWI data, we divided the patients into three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotypes: large cortical, small (&lt; 1 cm in diameter) cortical, and deep pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent factors for each <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotype were evaluated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, premorbid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.40-6.65) and older age (OR, 1.05 per 1 year increase; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08) were independently associated with the small cortical phenotypic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, younger age (OR, 0.95 per 1 year increase; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98), premorbid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> non-use (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.99), and higher levels of fasting s-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (OR, 1.01 per 1 mg/dl increase; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02) and admission peripheral WBC counts (OR, 1.13 per 1 x 10(9) cells/L; 95% CI, 1.00-1.27) were independently associated with the large cortical pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no relation between DWI patterns and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age, premorbid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use, s-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and WBC count predict atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies should examine whether modifying some of these factors may result in more favorable phenotypic patterns </plain></SENT>
