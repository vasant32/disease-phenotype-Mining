<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, EPO's effect has been assessed in several experimental models of brain and spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to validate whether treatment with recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) would limit the extent of injury following experimental TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental TBI was induced in rats by a cryogenic injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rHuEPO or placebo was injected intraperitoneally immediately after the injury and then every 8 h until 2 or 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after injury brain water content, an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, was measured with the wet-dry method and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown was evaluated by assay of Evans blue extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, extent of cerebral damage was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of rHuEPO markedly improved recovery from motor dysfunction compared with placebo group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was significantly reduced in the cortex of the EPO-treated group relative to that in the placebo-treated group (80.6+/-0.3% versus 91.8%+/-0.8% respectively, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> breakdown was significantly lower in EPO-treated group than in the placebo-treated group (66.2+/-18.7 mug/g versus 181.3+/-21 mug/g, respectively, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EPO treatment reduced injury volume significantly compared with placebo group (17.4+/-5.4 mm3 versus 37.1+/-5.3 mm3, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EPO, administered in its recombinant form, affords significant neuroprotection in experimental TBI model and may hold promise for future clinical applications </plain></SENT>
