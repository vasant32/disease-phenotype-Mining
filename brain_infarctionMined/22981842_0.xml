<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bilateral changes in the hemispheric reorganisation have been observed chronically after unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypotheses were that activity dependent competition between the lesioned and non-lesioned corticospinal systems would result in persisting asymmetry and be associated with poor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven subjects (medium 6.5 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) were compared to 9 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The power spectral density (PSD) of the sensorimotor electroencephalogram (SM1-EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) and corticomuscular coherence (CMC) were studied during rest and isometric contraction of right or left opponens pollicis (OP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global recovery was assessed using NIH score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: There was bilateral loss of beta frequency activity in the SM1-EEGs and OP-EMGs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and controls in symmetry indices estimated between the two corticospinal systems for SM1-EEG, OP-EMG and CMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Performance correlated with preservation of beta frequency power in OP-EMG in both hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symmetry indices for the SM1-EEG, OP-EMG and CMC correlated with recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Significant changes occurred at both cortical and spinomuscular levels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but to the same degree and in the same direction in both the lesioned and non-lesioned corticospinal systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Global recovery correlated with the degree of symmetry between corticospinal systems at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three levels - cortical and spinomuscular levels and their connectivity (CMC), but not with the absolute degree of abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Re-establishing balance between the corticospinal systems may be important for overall motor function, even if it is achieved at the expense of the non-lesioned system </plain></SENT>
