<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several investigators have used murine models to investigate the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The focal ischemic model is a closer approximation to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which includes a necrotic core, penumbra, and undamaged tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of a unilateral artery, especially the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), is performed in this model, but collateral circulation often induces variation of ischemic lesions both qualitatively and quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the more proximal the artery which is unilaterally occluded is, the more inconsistent the outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the reproducibility of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion by distal or proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct occlusion of the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was performed and compared with unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAO) consistently induced ischemic lesions in cortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> model animals (n=14) survived 24 h after occlusion, and exhibited a maximum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (20.0 +/- 5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, permanent and transient unilateral CCAO models had mortality rates of 62.5 and 25.0%, and showed severe to absent lesions with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of 29.0 +/- 20.8 and 33.2 +/- 24.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, distal MCAO produces high reproducibility of ischemic insults and survivability compared to unilateral CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, distal MCAO is a useful method for the focal ischemic model </plain></SENT>
