<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation may exacerbate H-I injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resident microglia release proinflammatory cytokines and proteases in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular, activate cytokines and degrade basement membrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These actions ultimately permit entry of peripheral leukocytes into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> neuropil, enhancing neuroinflammation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently, the relative contributions of resident and peripheral immune cells to ischemic brain injury are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study employed an ex vivo model of H-I through oxygen <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) to identify the cellular localization of MMP-9 in organotypic hippocampal slices from rat, and to determine whether inhibiting gelatin-degrading MMPs affords neuroprotection in the absence of peripheral immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed ubiquitous neuronal MMP-9 expression in both normoxic and hypoxic slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased MMP-9 expression was detected in CD11b-positive microglia after 48 h exposure to OGD relative to normoxic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these data, in situ zymography showed increased gelatinolytic activity after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gelatin-cleaved fluorescence localized to astrocytic processes and somata of various cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with either the MMP inhibitor AG3340 (prinomastat) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> dampened OGD-induced gelatinolytic activity and neural injury, as measured by Fluoro-Jade staining, relative to vehicle controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results show that resident microglia, in the absence of peripheral immune cells, were sufficient to enhance neural injury after OGD in the organotypic hippocampal slice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these effects were associated with upregulation or secretion of MMP-9, and were blocked after treatment with either the gelatinase-selective compound AG3340 or the anti-inflammatory compound <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data, coupled with the effectiveness of these compounds previously shown in vivo, support the selective targeting of gelatin-degrading MMPs and activated microglia as potential therapeutic approaches to combat neonatal H-I injury </plain></SENT>
