<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With diffusion-tensor imaging (DTi) it is possible to estimate the structural characteristics of fiber bundles in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used DTi to infer damage to the corticospinal tract (CST) and relates this parameter to (a) the level of residual motor ability at least 1 year poststroke and (b) the outcome of intensive motor rehabilitation with constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of CST damage in recovery and CIMT efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with low-functioning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were scanned and tested at baseline, before and after CIMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion overlap with the CST was indexed as reduced anisotropy compared with a CST variability map derived from 26 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Residual motor ability was measured through the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and the Motor Activity Log (MAL) acquired at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CIMT benefit was assessed through the pre-post treatment comparison of WMFT and MAL performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesion overlap with the CST correlated with residual motor ability at baseline, with greater deficits observed in patients with more extended CST damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume showed no systematic association with residual motor ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CIMT led to significant improvements in motor function but outcome was not associated with the extent of CST damage or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study gives in vivo support for the proposition that structural CST damage, not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, is a major predictor for residual functional ability in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results provide initial evidence for positive effects of CIMT in patients with varying, including more severe, CST damage </plain></SENT>
