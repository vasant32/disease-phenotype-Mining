<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study sought to identify potential targets for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy that can be exploited pharmacologically beyond the current 4.5h time limit for clinical administration of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used PCR arrays to initially screen the temporal expression profiles of several chemokine-related genes in the brain at 4, 24 and 72h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified large increases (&gt;10-fold) in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at 24 or 72h for the neutrophil CXCR2 receptor, and for CXCL1 and CXCL2-two chemokine ligands expressed by monocytes and neutrophils with strong neutrophil chemoattractant activity via CXCR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then tested the efficacy of a CXCR2 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> as a therapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated with vehicle (1% DMSO) or SB225002 (2mg/kg per day, ip) commencing at reperfusion, and we evaluated chemokine gene expression, neutrophil infiltration and functional and histological endpoints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCR2 after 24h were markedly reduced to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in SB225002-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase-positive cell infiltration was significantly reduced in SB225002-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice, and was similar to levels in sham-operated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, although SB225002 evidently antagonised the interaction between CXCR2 and its chemokine ligands in the ischemic brain, mice treated with either SB225002 or vehicle had similar motor impairment and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 72h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the reduced expression of CXC chemokine subfamily genes and neutrophil-related infiltration following SB225002 administration did not improve outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CXCR2 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are therefore unlikely to be a potential therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
