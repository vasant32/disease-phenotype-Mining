<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exercise for 3 weeks has been shown to provide neuroprotection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion insults by decreasing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explores the expression of Toll-like receptor-4 in brain parenchyma during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> after exercise, in association with brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied in four groups (control, exercise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after exercise) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise consisted of 30 minutes of treadmill running daily for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an intraluminal filament, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by 2 hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining was used to determine brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain Toll-like receptor-4 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression and protein levels were determined by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exercise significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased Toll-like receptor-4 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, in association with significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group had significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased levels of Toll-like receptor-4 expression compared to the control, whereas the exercise/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group was significantly (p&lt;0.05) attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exercise reduced Toll-like receptor-4 expression within brain tissue in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first paper, to our knowledge, indicating the correlation between exercise, Toll-like receptor-4 expression and reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
