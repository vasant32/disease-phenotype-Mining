<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated N.M., a person with bilateral amygdala damage and a left thalamic lesion, who was impaired at recognizing fear from facial expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>N.M. showed an equivalent deficit affecting fear recognition from body postures and emotional sounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His deficit of fear recognition was not linked to evidence of any problem in recognizing anger (a common feature in other reports), but for his everyday experience of emotion N.M. reported reduced anger and fear compared with neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings show a specific deficit compromising the recognition of the emotion of fear from a wide range of social signals, and suggest a possible relationship of this type of impairment with alterations of emotional experience </plain></SENT>
