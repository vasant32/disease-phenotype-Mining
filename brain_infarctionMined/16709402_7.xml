<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has previously been reported to reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in 7-day-old rat pups with an in vivo cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model (Jensen et al., 1994) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether improvement is found in both behavioral measures of protection and by histological measures of infarcted tissue at 72 h after reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rMCAo) in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-hour rMCAo was induced in adult rats using the intraluminal suture technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18315">PQQ</z:chebi> (10, 3, and 1 mg/kg) was given once by intravenous injection at the initiation, or 3 h after the initiation, of 2 h rMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral deficits were evaluated daily for 3 days followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measurements by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18315">PQQ</z:chebi> at 10 mg/kg infused at the initiation, or 3 h after the initiation, of rMCAo was effective in reducing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes measured 72 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a dose of 3 mg/kg significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared to vehicle-treated animals, but 1 mg/kg was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral scores were also significantly better in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18315">PQQ</z:chebi>-treated group compared to the vehicle controls when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18315">PQQ</z:chebi> was given at 10 and 3 mg/kg, but not at 1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18315">PQQ</z:chebi> is neuroprotective when given as a single administration at least 3 h after initiation of rMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18315">PQQ</z:chebi> may be a useful neuroprotectant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
