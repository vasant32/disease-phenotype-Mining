<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine incidence of and risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Japanese diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTINGS: We conducted a prospective study at 59 hospitals throughout Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients included 940 men and 831 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (mean age, 58.2 yr) without a history of cardiovascular complications who were followed for a median of 7.86 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: This was an observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of CHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidences of CHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> per 1000 person-years were 9.59 and 7.45, respectively, whereas those of myocardial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> were 3.84 and 6.29, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the serum log-transformed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level was a potent and independent predictor of CHD [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-1.94 per 1 sd increase), comparable to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol (HR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.25-1.78 per 1 sd increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">Triglycerides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> linearly and continuously increased CHD risk, and subjects in the top third for both had markedly high risks of CHD, and their effects were possibly additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> worked independently of blood pressure levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was the only significant predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> except for age (HR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.04-1.65, per 1 sd increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level was a leading predictor of CHD, comparable to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level is not a leading predictor of CHD in diabetic subjects in Western countries, ethnic group-specific strategies for prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1504375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic macroangiopathy</z:e> may be indicated </plain></SENT>
