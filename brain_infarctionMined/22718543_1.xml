<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> is increasingly viewed as a new therapeutic target in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, apart from causing secondary damage, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> could equally promote beneficial lesion remodeling and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distinct subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages (MOs/MPs) may critically determine the outcome of lesion-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We addressed the role of bone marrow-derived MOs/MPs in 2 different mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> using a combined cell-specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, chemokine receptor knockout, bone marrow chimeric, and pharmacological approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Starting within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, immature Ly6c(hi) monocytes infiltrated into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone and differentiated into mature Ly6c(lo) phagocytes within the lesion compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MO/MP infiltration was CCR2-dependent, whereas we did not obtain evidence for additional recruitment via CX3CR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of circulating MOs/MPs or selective targeting of CCR2 in bone marrow-derived cells caused delayed clinical deterioration and hemorrhagic conversion of the infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> frequently occurred around thin-walled, dilated neovessels in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone and was accompanied by decreased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and collagen-4, along with diminished activation of Smad2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injection of TGF-β1 into the lesion border zone greatly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in MO/MP-depleted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Bone marrow-derived MOs/MPs recruited via CCR2 and acting via TGF-β1 are essential for maintaining integrity of the neurovascular unit following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future therapies should be aimed at enhancing physiological repair functions of CCR2(+) MOs/MPs rather than blocking their hematogenous recruitment </plain></SENT>
