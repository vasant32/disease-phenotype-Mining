<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated the clinical characteristics and cortical activation patterns of MMs in patients with <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata (CR) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, using functional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 31 consecutive hemiparetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with CR <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional MRI was performed to verify brain activation patterns during grasp-release movements of the affected hand, and MM of the unaffected hand was observed simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of MMs was 54.8% (17 out of 31 patients), and the intensity of MMs ranged from mild to moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of MM in the unaffected hand is closely related to the poor motor function of the affected upper extremity and to activations of the unaffected motor cortex and both supplementary motor areas (SMAs) during the movement of the affected hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the activations of unaffected motor cortex and both SMAs were closely related to poor motor function of the affected upper extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MMs, poor motor function, and the activations of ipsilateral motor cortex and both SMAs are closely interconnected in patients with CR <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
