<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether blood pressure (BP) variability is increased in hypertensive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD), we studied two samples of consecutive treated hypertensive patients: (1) 11 with BD (mean age 71.3 +/- 5.2 years); (2) 16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (mean age 65.2 +/- 8.3 years) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An averaged baseline office BP was obtained for 3 consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory BP monitoring was then carried out to obtain the averaged mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP, and BP variability was defined as the standard deviation of consecutive BP values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Diurnal SBP variability was significantly increased in the BD group (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, with the analysis of covariance for age and baseline office BP, the difference was no longer significant (p = 0.17 and p = 0.09, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased BP variability in BD patients is probably due to older age and increased baseline office BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased BP variability may be a risk factor for small-vessel disease, but not for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
