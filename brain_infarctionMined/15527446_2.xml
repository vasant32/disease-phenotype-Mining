<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LI) and ipsilateral large artery disease (LAD) greater than 50% must be classified according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) criteria as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the vascular risk factors, clinical symptoms, and outcome characteristics of LI associated with LAD with those patients with LI who fulfilled the TOAST criteria of small artery disease (SAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 1754 consecutive first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to our department, we analyzed age, gender, vascular risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, arterial peripheral disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use), clinical data (motor or sensitive deficit and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>), and outcome (hospitalization length, in-hospital medical complications rate, need of rehabilitation, treatment at discharge, in-hospital mortality, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge) of those patients classified as LI associated with LAD as compared with those with SAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a strict application of the TOAST criteria, we found 144 patients with LI associated with SAD and 73 patients with LI associated with LAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed statistical differences in gender (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.23-0.89; P = 0.014), past history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13-0.78; P = 0.004), and smoking (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.31-1.04; P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After logistic regression analysis only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78; P = 0.013), and gender (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.28-0.98; P = 0.05) showed statistical differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, six patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with LI associated with LAD) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrences (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.26-0.39; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1) There are no differences in clinical presentation and in-hospital outcome between patients with LI associated with SAD and patients with LI associated with LAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2) Risk factors are very similar in both groups, and the only differences observed (gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>) are related to the atherosclerotic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> recurrence seems to be more frequent in LI associated with LAD than in LI associated with SAD, but large follow-up studies are needed to be able to decide whether clinical recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> allows to differentiate both clinical entities </plain></SENT>
