<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SBI is increased in CT or magnetic resonance imaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), but its relation with rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> (MS), another major source of emboli, is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of SBI in patients with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients with MS (44 females and 9 males; range 25-52 years; mean age 38 +/- 7 years) diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004382'>Mitral valve calcification</z:hpo>, left atrium (LA) dimension, and the presence of associating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> on TTE were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic evaluation was done for rhythm analysis and neurologic examination was performed prior to cerebral CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery Doppler examination was carried out in patients with SBI to exclude carotid artery lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242510" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug usage</z:e>, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in LA, left ventricular segmental or systolic dysfunction, or other valve diseases were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of SBI was found to be 24.5% in patients with MS (47% cortical, 53% lacunar) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SBI was observed to be significantly high in patients with LA dimension &gt; 4 cm or in patients with AF (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SBI incidence was markedly higher if AF was found with enlarged LA when compared with patients having sinus rhythm and small LA (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was associated with MS, the SBI incidence was found to be lower (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although SBI was higher in patients with MVA &lt; 1.5 cm2, it was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between calcific and noncalcific valves for SBI (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that SBI may be expected in about 1/4 of patients with MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The presence of LA enlargement and AF increase the incidence of SBI in patients with MS, whereas the presence of moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> decreases the incidence of SBI </plain></SENT>
