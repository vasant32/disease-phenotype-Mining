<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The incidence of venous infarction after surgical resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> is low, but its occurrence can necessitate additional surgical procedures and long hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated variables associated with venous infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 825 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100009'>intracranial meningiomas</z:hpo> who underwent microsurgical resection between January 1993 and March 2011, 27 (3.3%) presented with neurological deterioration due to postoperative venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following factors were included in the statistical analysis to determine their association with venous infarction: sex, age, location, relation to venous sinus, peritumoural <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, size and degree of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of venous infarction was 6.8% with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> (size â‰¥ 4 cm), but with small (size &lt; 4 cm) was reduced to 1.2% (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>Meningiomas</z:hpo> with perilesional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> elicited venous infarction more frequently than those without (5.1% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Venous infarction was also determined to occur at 5.5% frequency in superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, such as parasagittal, falx and convexity, but only at 0.5% frequency in deep locations (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous infarction additionally occurred less often in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> at a distance from the midline venous sinus than in those nearby, such as parasagittal and falx (2.2% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To prevent venous infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> surgery, it is essential to maintain the intervening arachnoid plane as much as possible; this is especially important in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> larger than 4 cm, combined with peritumoural <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or positioned superficially around the midline venous sinus </plain></SENT>
