<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a major factor limiting the use of thrombolytic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animal model can help us to understand HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is to establish a HT model in rats to compare HT with uncomplicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in neurobehavioral deficit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, brain <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, and to investigate its pathology changes as well as the impact of, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi>, a ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel (K(ATP) channel) blocker, on the pathogenesis of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: hemorrhagic transformation (HT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi>+HT (GH) and a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To create HT model, right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was conducted with intraluminal thread technique; 30 min after MCAO, 50 microL arterial blood was injected into the caudate nucleus where the infarction occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit was evaluated by Longa test, Berderson test and Beam test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain water content, brain ATPase activity and SDH activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histology was examined using light microscope and transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference in neurobehavioral deficit and brain water content was observed between HT and CI groups in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain ATPase activity 12 h and 24 h after operation and brain SDH activity 24 h after the operation in HT group were both significantly increased compared with those in CI group (P&lt;0.05); the increase of brain ATPase and SDH activity in HT group could be prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>Neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in HT group, swollen neuropil and loosen intercellular substance in CI group were revealed by histology study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural changes including <z:mp ids='MP_0011632'>swollen mitochondria</z:mp> and interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were also observed in both HT and CI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that moderate hemorrhagic transformation does not significantly aggravate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and that K(ATP) channels have an important role in energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
