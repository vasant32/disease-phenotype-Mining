<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Single center retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed of AIR and NAION from Jan 2008 to Jan 2009 in Beijing Tongren hospital were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The demographical data, the results of blood tests, cardiac examinations, carotid vascular ultrasound and brain MRI were analyzed by Chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one AIR patients and 143 NAION patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the NAION patients (51.4 ± 8.9) was lower than that of the AIR group (55.4 ± 15.8) (t = 2.514, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the gender, smoking status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels between these two groups (χ(2) = 0.023, 2.727, 0.217, 0.012; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (total cholesterol &gt; 5.17 mmol/L) was 46.2% (66/143) in the NAION group and 26.4% (24/91) in the AIR group (χ(2) = 9.193, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> was 13.2% (12/91) in the AIR group and 4.9% (7/143) in the NAION group (χ(2) = 5.125, P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was present in 34.5% (30/87) patients in the AIR group, whereas none in the NAION group (χ(2) = 44.370, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 57 AIR patients and 127 NAION patients who finished brain MRI, the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was 47.4% (27/57) in the AIR group and 0.8% (1/127) in the NAION group (χ(2) = 66.210, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were present in 66.9% (85/127) of the NAION group and 36.8% (21/57) in the AIR group (χ(2) = 66.46, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mean age of NAION patients was lower than that of the AIR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which might indicate large-middle vessel disease, are common in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>WMH with small vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, possibly caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, is more common in the NAION group </plain></SENT>
