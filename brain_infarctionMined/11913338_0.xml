<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined working memory performance in six individuals with isolated thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and found evidence of impairment on a number of working memory span tasks, but not on a forward digit-span measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examination of additional aspects of working memory performance (e.g., spatial and object working memory), analysis of subjects with other sites of thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and functional neuroimaging suggest a role of the thalamus in working memory </plain></SENT>
