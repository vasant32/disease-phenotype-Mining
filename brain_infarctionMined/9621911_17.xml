<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements on a 4.7-T NMR imaging system were performed between the control phase and approximately 6 h postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the center of the ischemic lesion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) decreased rapidly to 84.4 +/- 4.2% (mean +/- SD) of the control values approximately 2 min postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 6 h postocclusion, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was reduced to 67.1 +/- 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, large differences between the animals were observed for the temporal increase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (Lac) in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum Lac signal was reached in four rats after 0.5-1.5 h, and in two rats was not reached even after 6 h postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six h postocclusion, SI spectra measured at a TE of 136 ms revealed a decrease in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi> signal of N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) to 67 +/- 13% of the control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences were observed between the spatial regions of decreased <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and increased Lac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the lesions, a T2 relaxation time of Lac of 292 +/- 40 ms, considering a J-coupling constant of 6.9 Hz, was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a prolongation of the T2 of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi> signal of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>/phosphocreatine (Cr/PCr) was observed in the lesion, from 163 +/- 22 ms during control to 211 +/- 41 ms approximately 6 h postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The experiments proved that DWI and proton SI are valuable tools to provide complementary information on processes associated with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
