<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tethering of neutrophils to brain endothelium is mediated by selectins, and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration by endothelial intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and neutrophil CD18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In experimental studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury, brain damage has been ameliorated by administration of antibodies to these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of P-selectin and ICAM-1 in sections of brain from patients who had experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and who died 3.5 h to 9 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelial immunopositivity for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules was maximal at about 2-3 days then declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 1 day and 3 days, P-selectin was also detected on platelets in blood vessels within infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but not sections of brain from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> patients, P-selectin and ICAM-1 were again detectable at 1 week, when hyperplastic endothelial cells were labelled in capillaries in and immediately adjacent to the infarcted tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding that P-selectin and ICAM-1 are upregulated within focally infarcted brain tissue supports the concept that blocking neutrophil <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> may be of benefit in treating atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in man </plain></SENT>
