<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We adopted <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference (RNAi) as a means of suppressing the expression of RGMa and observed the improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> and neurological function of rats after cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinant adenovirus rAd5-shRNA-RGMa was constructed and prepared for animal experimentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RGMa and neurofilament protein 200 (NF200) in the ischemic cortex and ipsilateral hippocampus were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic regions were examined by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and the newborn neurite branches by Biotinylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">Amine</z:chebi> (BDA) neuronal tracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavior tests were adopted to evaluate neurologic function recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed RGMa was down-regulated and axonal growth was improved in the RNAi treated group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of axonal sprouts of corticospinal tract from the uninjured side to the ischemic side in the RNAi treated group was increased (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Behavior test scores in the RNAi treated group were significantly better than other groups after 6 weeks (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RGMa in rat brains after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) can be down-regulated by RNAi successfully, which may lead to improved axonal growth and neural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> plasticity, as well as neuron functional recovery </plain></SENT>
