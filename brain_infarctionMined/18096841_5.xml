<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of a number of neurological signs in a large population of patients with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD) and to compare the relative frequency of specific neurological signs dependent on type of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven hundred six patients with VaD (NINDS-AIREN) were included from a large multicenter clinical trial (registration number NCT00099216) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline neurological examination, the presence of 16 neurological signs was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on MRI, patients were classified as having large vessel VaD (18%; large territorial or strategical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI), small vessel VaD (74%; white matter hyperintensities [WMH], multiple lacunes, bilateral thalamic lesions on MRI), or a combination of both (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A median number of 4.5 signs per patient was presented (maximum 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reflex asymmetry was the most prevalent symptom (49%), hemianopia was most seldom presented (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measures of small vessel disease were associated with an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, parkinsonian gait disorder, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002375'>hypokinesia</z:hpo> and as well to hemimotor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in the presence of a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, hemianopia, hemimotor dysfunction, hemisensory dysfunction, reflex asymmetry, and hemiplegic gait disorder were more often observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The specific neurological signs demonstrated by patients with VaD differ according to type of imaged cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even in people who meet restrictive VaD criteria, small vessel disease is often seen with more subtle signs, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo>, whereas large vessel disease is more often related to lateralized sensorimotor changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
