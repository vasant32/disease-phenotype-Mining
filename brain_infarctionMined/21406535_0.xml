<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, 168 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the thalamus were investigated by use of diffusion weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Involved thalamic territories were classified into four vascular territories: anterior (polar artery), posteromedial (thalamoperforating artery), ventrolateral (thalamogeniculate artery) and posterolateral (posterior choroidal artery) territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving specific vascular territories in association with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes and aetiologies were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant association between involvement of the ventrolateral thalamus and isolated thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (49 patients (73%), p&lt;0.01) or posterior cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (29 patients (76%), p=0.02), and between involvement of the posteromedial thalamus and top of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery syndrome</z:e> (17 patients (77%), p&lt;0.001) or extended posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (29 patients (71%), p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ventrolateral territory was most commonly affected in association with small vessel disease (43 patients (72%), p=0.03) and the posteromedial territory in association with large artery disease (19 patients (63%), p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the ventrolateral, posteromedial and posterolateral territories were equally affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate a specific association between the topographic patterns of thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndromes and aetiologies </plain></SENT>
