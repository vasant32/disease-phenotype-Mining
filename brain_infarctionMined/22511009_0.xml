<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Asiatic acid (AA) has been shown to attenuate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in a mouse model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and shows promise as a neuroprotective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate translation of these findings to clinical studies, we determined pharmacokinetics, a dose-response relationship, the therapeutic time window, and efficacy using multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also explored potential mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Escalating doses of intravenous AA were administered and serum concentrations were measured at multiple time points for the pharmacokinetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a dose-response relationship was determined followed by administration at different intervals after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to establish a therapeutic time window for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measurements included both histological and behavioral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> function and matrix metalloproteinase activity in controls and treated rats were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic studies showed that AA (75 mg/kg) has a half-life of 2.0 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AA significantly decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and improved neurological outcome even when administration was at time points up to 12 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was also significantly decreased in female rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AA attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows AA is effective against multiple models of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, has a long therapeutic time window, and is also effective in females and hypertensive animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AA may mediate neuroprotection by protecting mitochondria and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 induction and activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taken together these data suggest that AA is an excellent candidate for development as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
