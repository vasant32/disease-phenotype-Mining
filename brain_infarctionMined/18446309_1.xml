<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) appears on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as leukoaraiosis (LA), état criblé (EC), and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (MLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> is poorly understood, there is evidence of a genetic contribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to analyze the influence of the renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system (RAAS) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> in symptomatic patients from the Génétique de l'Infarctus Cérébral (GENIC) study, including RAAS polymorphisms and circulating angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Caucasian patients (n=510) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) were recruited and MRIs were evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, including LA, EC, and MLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We considered ACE levels and several polymorphisms, including ACE, angiotensinogen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> synthase CYP11B2, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the polymorphisms, there were marginal negative associations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> synthase CYP11B2 -344C against severe EC (adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.05) and severe LA (adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30-0.95), both considering -344C dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of -344C decreased with the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> abnormalities (p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma ACE was elevated in patients with MLI, but not with LA or EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of MLI increased gradually with increasing plasma ACE (adjusted OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study found no strong evidence for RAAS involvement in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The whole spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, including EC, MLI, and LA, can be considered as phenotypes for genetic studies </plain></SENT>
