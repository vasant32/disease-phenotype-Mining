<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioural tests are essential when recording performance throughout the time course of an experiment and the results bear predictive value in preclinical animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to establish a behavioural test procedure for a model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by injection of endothelin-1 (eMCAO) that results in relatively mild behavioural deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The test protocol used in the present study allows evaluation of quantitative and qualitative impairments in skilled motor performance and is sensitive to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> deficits at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> post-ischemic time intervals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methods 115 (2002) 169] is a motor test that assesses skilled walking and measures both forelimb and hindlimb placing, stepping and inter-limb co-ordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study we tested the effect of two different technical variants of endothelin-1 application on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and motor skills (1) application via pre-implanted guiding cannula in awake animals and (2) via direct injection under <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We showed that the ladder rung walking task is sensitive in the assessment of loss of fine motor function after induction of relatively small lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In animals with implanted cannulas we found a smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and an increase in placement errors prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> animals with eMCAO under anaesthesia showed a long lasting impairment of the contralateral forelimb up to 4 weeks post-eMCAO </plain></SENT>
