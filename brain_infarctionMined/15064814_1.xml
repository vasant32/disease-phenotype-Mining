<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats, the left medial cerebral artery was occluded for 1, 1.5 or 2 h by inserting a 4-0 nylon monofilament suture into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, the brains were processed for histochemical triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and quantitation of the schemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each TTC-stained brain section, the ischemic tissue was dissected with a scalpel and fixed in 10% formalin at 0 masculine C until its total mass could be estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mass (mg) of the ischemic tissue was weighed on an analytical balance and compared to its volume (mm(3)), estimated either by plethysmometry using <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> electrodes or by computer-assisted image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size as measured by the weighing method (mg), and reported as a percent (%) of the affected (left) hemisphere, correlated closely with volume (mm(3), also reported as %) estimated by computerized image analysis (r = 0.88; P &lt; 0.001; N = 10) or by plethysmography (r = 0.97-0.98; P &lt; 0.0001; N = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This degree of correlation was maintained between different experimenters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method was also sensitive for detecting the effect of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> durations on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (P &lt; 0.005; N = 23), and the effect of drug treatments in reducing the extent of brain damage (P &lt; 0.005; N = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that, in addition to being simple and low cost, the weighing method is a reliable alternative for quantifying brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
