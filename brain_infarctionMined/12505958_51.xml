<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 1, 40 rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control animals received 100% oxygen 1 h/d for 5 days, whereas the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (Iso)1, Iso2, and Iso3 groups received 0.75%, 1.5%, or 2.25% Iso in oxygen 1 h/d for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, 36 rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: controls received 100% oxygen 1 h/d for 5 days; animals in the Iso and I+G (Iso+<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>) groups received 2% Iso in oxygen 1 h/d for 5 days, and the I+G group received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> (GLB) (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) before each Iso pretreatment </plain></SENT>
