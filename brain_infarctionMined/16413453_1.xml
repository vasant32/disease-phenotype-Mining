<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There have been only five reported cases with cerebellar hemorrhagic infarction after spinal surgery, and the underlying pathomechanism remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe a case with multiple cerebellar hemorrhagic infarctions after surgery for a huge atlantoaxial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>neurinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Case report METHODS: A 36-year-old man underwent uneventful surgery for a huge atlantoaxial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>neurinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the patient was lethargic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001350'>slurred speech</z:hpo> and subsequently developed cerebellar symptoms, although preoperative myelopathic symptoms did not worsen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical and radiological findings are presented, and possible causes of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain after surgery showed multiple cerebellar hemorrhagic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, magnetic resonance angiography revealed no occlusion or stenosis in the vertebrobasilar system, and a duplex scan of the neck vessels confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow in the vertebral arteries after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In response to the conservative treatment, the patient exhibited neurological recovery with disappearance of cerebellar symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present case with multiple cerebellar hemorrhagic infarctions, venous infarction appears more likely to be the cause of cerebellar hemorrhagic infarction than arterial infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most likely underlying pathomechanism is a cerebellar venous disturbance precipitated by loss of a large amount of cerebrospinal fluid, although the exact etiology remains elusive </plain></SENT>
