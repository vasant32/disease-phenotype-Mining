<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 32 patients with ischaemic infarction of the occipital lobe were studied prospectively, using a Humphrey Visual Field Analyser II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The visual field of each eye was divided into central, paracentral and peripheral zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean visual sensitivity of each zone was calculated and used for the statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the initial examination, performed within 2 weeks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were compared with the results of the sixth-month control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions were assigned to the localisations, optic radiation, striate cortex, occipital pole and occipital convexity, by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement was noted, especially for the lower quadrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions of the occipital pole and convexity were not significantly associated with visual-field recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, involvement of the striate cortex and extensive lesions involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the areas studied was significantly associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual-field defects</z:hpo> in our patients improved within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Restoration of the lower quadrants and especially the peripheral zones was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incomplete damage to the striate cortex, which has a varying pattern of vascular supply, could explain this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Magnification factor theory, which is the increment of the receptive-field size of striate cortex cells with visual-field eccentricity, may explain the more significant improvement in the peripheral zones </plain></SENT>
