<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Different strategies have been employed to recanalize acutely occluded middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries (ICA) in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> including intravenous and intra-arterial tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, pharmaceutical thrombolysis alone, may not be effective in patients with a large amount of clot volume (complete M1, terminal internal carotid artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our initial experience with endovascular clot disruption using a soft <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloon in addition to intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective review of nine patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from clot in the middle cerebral or internal carotid territories who were treated with intracranial balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> less than six hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom computed tomography (CT) angiography confirmed the presence of large vessel clot (terminal ICA, M1 or proximal M2) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A CT perfusion was performed providing maps of cerebral blood volume, flow and mean transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the patient presented less than three hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was also administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial tPA was delivered into the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the volume of clot was judged to be significant by the treating neurointerventionist, then a limited trial of tPA was administered intra-arterially followed by balloon angioplasty of persistant clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The time from imaging to vessel recanalization was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale and Barthel Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnostic CT perfusion studies were performed in 7 (78%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which showed a significant amount of salvageable tissue as judged by the treating neurointerventionist and neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recanalization (TIMI 2 or 3) was possible in 8 (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and 2 (22%) asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The average time from performance of the initial emergency CT to vessel recanalization was 2.1 hours with mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to vessel recanalization of 4.1 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Five (56%) patients had good outcomes, 1 (11%) had mild and 3 (33%) had moderate to severe disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clot angioplasty can potentially shorten recanalization times in well-selected patients and can be an effective complimentary procedure in patients with tPA resistant clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty can be performed with a very low complication rate using the technique described and may be associated with good outcomes </plain></SENT>
