<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Object of this study is to describe venous structures related to SSS with silicon injected cadaveric models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: This study was on 6 silicon injected cadaveric heads at <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Anatomy</z:mp> Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duramater was removed and veins on parasagittal area were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, veins draining into SSS, their size, number and distance were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean vein number draining into SSS is 2.9±1.5 at anterior to coronal suture (CS), between CS and vertex is 3.2±0.8, between vertex and lambdoid suture (LS) is 2.3±0.9, between LS and confluens sinuum 0.3±0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statically difference between right and left sides (p=0.140, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diameter of veins was 2.4±1.0 mm at anterior to CS, 3.0±1.2 mm at between CS and vertex, 2.4±0.7 mm at between vertex and LS, and 2.2±0.5 mm at between LS and confluens sinuum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Knowing details of anatomic structures of SSS and venous structures draining into it may protect the patients from many surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SSS and related structures with surgical landmarks are valuable for neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
