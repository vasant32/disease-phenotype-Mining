<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial enteral nutrition therapy via naso-gastric tube, was continued via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> from the 24th pregnancy week, the <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> was changed into a <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> with jejunal position of the tube (JET-<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
