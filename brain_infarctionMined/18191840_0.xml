<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Urotensin-II (U-II) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23449">cyclic peptide</z:chebi> identified recently in many mammalian species including man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>U-II and its receptor are expressed in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, in the cardiovascular system and in other peripheral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> has been reported initially to be a potent vasoconstrictor, increasing evidence shows that its vascular actions strongly depend on species and vascular beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed the effects of U-II administration on cerebral blood flow (CBF) under physiological conditions and following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although intravenous injection of U-II had minimal effects on CBF as measured by the technique of laser Doppler flowmetry, its administration (10 nmol) into the lateral cerebral ventricle induced gradual and long lasting increase in CBF (+61% at 1 h post-injection, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These U-II-mediated CBF increases were not related to the transient systemic pressor actions of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and were reduced by nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibition (61 vs 17%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular administration of U-II following the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, failed to alter residual CBF in the affected cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, following reperfusion (90 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), U-II-treated animals displayed a remarkable hyperperfusion compared to vehicle-treated rats (+168%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volume of infarction was significantly increased in U-II-treated rats (+40%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first evidence that U-II increases cerebral blood flow when administered into the cerebral ventricle and exacerbates brain damage following an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
