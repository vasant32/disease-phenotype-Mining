<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there were differences in neuroradiological features, including white-matter lesions and gray-matter volumes, between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> with and without mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of the vascular type (MCI-V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> were studied within 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCI-V was found in 22 patients, who in comparison with patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were significantly older and had fewer years of formal education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI subcortical hyperintensities especially in the basal ganglia (putamen and thalamus) were significantly more frequent in the MCI-V group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the voxel-based morphometric study, patients with MCI-V showed more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> bilaterally in the middle temporal gyrus, right and left frontal and posterior bilateral occipitoparietal regions including the posterior cingulate as well as in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A region of interest analysis restricted to the parahippocampi and hippocampi showed further reduced bilateral parahippocampal gyrus and right hippocampus volume reductions in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the amount of white-matter lesions among MCI-V showed negative correlations with gray-matter volume in frontal and temporal areas as well as with the thalamus and mesencephalon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide support for an anatomical substrate of the MCI entity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both gray- and white-matter changes seem to contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> of such patients </plain></SENT>
