<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that dietary ethyl docosahexaenoate (Et-DHA) intake decreases the level of membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (AA), which reduces the generation of AA metabolites in ischemic gerbil brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As an extended study, we further investigated the influence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of Et-DHA on free AA levels after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, Na,K-ATPase activity, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> content, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and brain damage were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weanling male gerbils were orally pretreated with either Et-DHA (200 mg/kg) or vehicle, once a day for 10 weeks, and subjected to transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by bilateral common carotid occlusion for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time-course analyses revealed that pretreatment with Et-DHA, compared with pretreatment with the vehicle, significantly decreased the brain's free AA levels during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (5, 15 and 30 min) and after reperfusion (5, 10, 15 and 30 min), and attenuated the decline of Na,K-ATPase activity at examined time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with Et-DHA significantly prevented an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> concentration and a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> concentration after 24 h of reperfusion, which resulted in lower cerebral water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and low animal mortality were also observed in Et-DHA-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced AA liberation and accumulation by Et-DHA pretreatment may be attributable to (a) protection against the decline of Na,K-ATPase activity, (b) postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and brain damage and (c) animal mortality </plain></SENT>
