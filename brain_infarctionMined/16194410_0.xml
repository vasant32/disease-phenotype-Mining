<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the change in the protein content and procoagulant activity of platelet-associated tissue factor (TF) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Platelets were isolated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 2B gel column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ELISA was employed to detect the TF protein content in the lysates of washed platelets, procoagulant activity of platelet-associated TF was measured with one stage clotting time assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A certain amount of TF antigen (16.37 +/- 6.39) ng/L was detected in resting platelets in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procoagulant activity of resting platelets and platelets activated by collagen were (0.89 +/- 0.26), (2.27 +/- 0.24) U/ml respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While specific TF McAb was added, the procoagulant activity of activated platelets can be markedly inhibited (1.39 +/- 0.28) U/ml (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is thus proved that the procoagulant activity of activated platelets mainly comes from TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TF protein content of the lysates of washed platelets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> group was (20.71 +/- 8.78), (23.83 +/- 8.03), (22.12 +/- 8.24) ng/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procoagulant activity of platelets without collagen treatment in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> was (1.71 +/- 0.24), (1.69 +/- 0.25), (1.75 +/- 0.31) U/ml respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When specific TF McAb was added specific TF McAb, the procoagulant activity was (1.43 +/- 0.25), (1.39 +/- 0.25), (1.40 +/- 0.29) U/ml respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TF protein content of lysates of washed platelets and the procoagulant activity of platelets without collagen treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> were significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This procoagulant activity can be inhibited by TF McAb (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The change in platelet-associated TF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> may contribute to the maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
