<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is argued that Charley Toorop suffered multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> with subsequent partial visuo-spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo> which prevented her from either recognizing and/or restoring the alleged imperfections in the painting "The Three Generations" </plain></SENT>
