<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the brain damage after CABG using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to correlate the results with neurological and neuropsychological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a neurological and neuropsychological examination before and after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance protocol was applied before and after (mean, 3 days) surgery and included a diffusion-weighted sequence and single-voxel MRS measurements in the frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the patients revealed a new focal neurological deficit after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated new ischemic lesions in 9 (26%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of an ischemic lesion was not related to impaired postoperative test performance (P&gt;.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The apparent diffusion coefficient values in the cerebellum and the centrum semiovale exhibited an increase after surgery (P&lt;.01), consistent with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following surgery, MRS revealed a significant decrease in the metabolite ratio of N-acetylaspartate-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (mean +/- SD, 1.69 +/- 0.20 vs 1.52 +/- 0.19; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extent of deterioration in neuropsychological test performance after surgery was closely related to the degree of the N-acetylaspartate-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratio decrease (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A follow-up MRS scan revealed a normalization of the N-acetylaspartate-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratio, which accompanied the recovery in psychological test performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative impairment in neuropsychological test performance is associated with a transient metabolic neuronal disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Focal ischemic lesions after CABG are more frequent than the apparent neurological complication rate; however, they are not related to the diffuse postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
