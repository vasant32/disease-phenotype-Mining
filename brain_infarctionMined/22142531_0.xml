<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(S)-ZJM-289 is a novel NO-releasing derivative of 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) with enhanced anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to investigate the neuroprotective effects and related mechanisms of (S)-ZJM-289 on ischemic neuronal injury in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary cortical neuronal cultures were exposured to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation followed by recovery (OGD/R), a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-like injury, and treated with (S)-ZJM-289 before OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro results showed that (S)-ZJM-289 attenuated OGD/R-induced neuronal injury, which was associated with the maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity and function by alleviating intracellular calcium overload and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane depolarization and preserving respiratory chain complexes activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, (S)-ZJM-289 treatment suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c) and nuclear translocation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor (AIF), thereby blocking mitochondria-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which may be partially mediated by up-regulation of Hsp70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection by (S)-ZJM-289 was also studied using a model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of (S)-ZJM-289 at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion for 3d significantly reduced the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, improved neurological deficit and prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In current study, (S)-ZJM-289 appears to be more potent in ischemic neuroprotection than NBP, in particular at the lower doses, which may be due to the synergistic action of NBP and NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings point to that (S)-ZJM-289 could be an attractive alternative to NBP in preventing the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
