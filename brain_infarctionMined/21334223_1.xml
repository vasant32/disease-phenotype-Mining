<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the effects of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> therapy on cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) in patients with controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prospectively enrolled 36 patients with controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol concentration &gt;100 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> 80 mg was given daily for 6 months and then discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VMR was assessed by hypercapnic and hypocapnic transcranial Doppler challenge in both the right and left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-five days after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> cessation, a repeat VMR was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VMR impairment was defined as ≤70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, liver function, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase level were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 60 years, 16 were men, and 13 had a previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level before treatment was 154 ± 30 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> lowered <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> by 53% at 3 months and by 46% at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline VMR was 71% ± 21% in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and 70% ± 19% in the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> on VMR was seen at 3 months and 6 months in the study population as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with baseline VMR impairment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> therapy was associated with significantly improved VMR at both 3 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This effect persisted for at least 45 days after discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> therapy can significantly improve impaired cerebral VMR, and that the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> on VMR persist for 1.5 months after discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We found no benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> therapy in patients with preserved baseline vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
