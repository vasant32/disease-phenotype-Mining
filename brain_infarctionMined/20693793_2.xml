<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with paramedian pons <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging including diffusion tensor imaging at admission and got 1-3 MR scans up to 6 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical scores and transcranial magnetic stimulation were acquired in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and 3-6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pyramidal tracts were manually segmented in fractional anisotropy (FA) color maps after coregistration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> datasets of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FA as well as axial and radial diffusivity were measured in the volume of lesioned and contralateral pyramidal tracts distally to the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 11 patients studied, 7 developed Wallerian degeneration detected as statistically significant decrease in FA over time in the distal pyramidal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wallerian degeneration could be detected at the earliest between the first and the third days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A continuous decrease in FA and an increase in axial and radial diffusivity in degenerating pyramidal tracts over time were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between NIHSS score on admission and the slope of relative axial diffusivity and a significant correlation between motor-evoked potential amplitudes of the arm on admission and the outcome relative FA was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image cannot predict the following Wallerian degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the severity of motor disturbance and the motor-evoked potential of the arm on admission could be possible parameters to predict Wallerian degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For estimation of Wallerian degeneration over time, at least 2 diffusion tensor imaging measurements have to be done at different time points </plain></SENT>
