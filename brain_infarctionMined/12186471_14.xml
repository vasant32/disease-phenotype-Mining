<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) remains to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors determined whether ischemic depolarizations (IDs) or cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> (CSDs) occur after SAH, and how these relate to the extent of tissue injury measured on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, they assessed whether administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> reduces depolarization time and lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By means of the endovascular suture model, experimental SAH was induced in 52 rats, of which 37 were appropriate for analysis, including four animals that underwent sham operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before induction of SAH, serum Mg++ levels were measured and 90 mg/kg intravascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32599">MgSO4</z:chebi> or saline was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extracellular direct current potentials were continuously recorded from six Ag/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30341">AgCl</z:chebi> electrodes, before and up to 90 minutes following SAH, after which serum Mg++ levels were again measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Next, animals were transferred to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging magnet for diffusion-weighted (DW) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Depolarization times per electrode were averaged to determine a mean depolarization time per animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No depolarizations occurred in sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ischemic depolarizations occurred at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electrodes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only two animals displayed a single spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of the ID time was 41 +/- 25 minutes in the saline-treated controls and 31 +/- 30 minutes in the Mg++-treated animals (difference 10 minutes: p = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps of tissue <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>, obtained using DW images approximately 2.5 hours after SAH induction, demonstrated hypointensities in both hemispheres, but predominantly in the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> abnormalities were found in sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mean lesion volume, as defined on the basis of a significant <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reduction, was 0.32 +/- 0.42 ml in saline-treated controls and 0.11 +/- 0.06 ml in Mg++-treated animals (difference 0.21 ml; p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Serum Mg++ levels were significantly elevated in the Mg++-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of their data, the authors suggest that CSDs play a minor role, if any, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pathophysiology of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Administration of Mg++ reduces the cerebral lesion volume that is present during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective value of Mg++ after SAH may, in part, be explained by a reduction in the duration of the ID of brain cells </plain></SENT>
