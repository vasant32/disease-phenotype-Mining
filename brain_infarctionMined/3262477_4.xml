<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A patient with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> underwent bone imaging which revealed a focal area of uptake that appeared to be localized in the right posterior calvarium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial interpretation was possible solitary metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> to the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skull radiographs and head computed tomography (CT) were suggested for follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The skull series was performed immediately after bone imaging and was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further clinical information revealed that the patient recently had undergone total right internal carotid artery ligation for treatment of a large, surgically inaccessible right cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPECT imaging of the head localized the region of abnormal uptake adjacent to the calvarium, which suggested the uptake was due to a recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A CT scan performed 4 days later demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002283'>generalized cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, but was otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, ruling out metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes the importance of SPECT imaging when a solitary skull lesion is found on bone imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SPECT can localize the lesion to be within the brain and/or skull and can aid in further investigative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A lesion located at the periphery of the brain may be due to an occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding is of particular consideration in the elderly in whom there is a relatively high incidence of coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
