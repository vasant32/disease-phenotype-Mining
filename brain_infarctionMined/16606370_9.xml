<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To provide insights into the effects of temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on the function of neurons and astrocytes in vivo, we measured the incorporation of radiolabel from [U-14C]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> into both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glutamine in brain subregions at 1 h of reperfusion following occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 2 or 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under the experimental conditions used, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> is mainly produced in neurons whereas <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-glutamine is generated in astrocytes from <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> of both neuronal and astrocytic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiolabel incorporation into both amino acids was greatly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The change in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> accumulation provides strong evidence for substantial reductions in neuronal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting decrease in delivery of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> from the neurons to astrocytes was probably also the major contributor to the change in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-glutamine content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These alterations probably result in part from a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of glycolytic activity in the neurons, as suggested by previous studies assessing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alterations in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were not restricted to tissue that would subsequently become infarcted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, these changes did not inevitably lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the affected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ATP : <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> ratio and phosphocreatine content were essentially preserved during recirculation following 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and showed at most only moderate losses in some subregions following 3 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This retention of energy reserves despite the decreases in <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in neurons suggests that energy needs were substantially reduced in the post-ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Marked increases in tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulation during recirculation, particularly following 3 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, provided evidence that impaired <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> oxidation probably also contributed to the altered <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the presence of complex changes in energy metabolism that are likely to greatly influence the responses of neurons and astrocytes to temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
