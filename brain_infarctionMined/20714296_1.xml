<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are not yet very clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated whether pre-ischemic treadmill training could induce brain ischemic tolerance (<z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi>) by inhibiting the excessive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and event-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation observed in rats exposed to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 12/group): sham surgery without prior exercise, MCAO without prior exercise and MCAO following three weeks of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-MCAO exercise significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (103.1 +/- 6.7 mm3) relative to MCAO without prior exercise (175.9 +/- 13.5 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, pre-MCAO exercise significantly reduced neurological defects (1.83 +/- 0.75) relative to MCAO without exercise (3.00 +/- 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, MCAO increased levels of phospho-ERK1/2 (69 +/- 5%) relative to sham surgery (40 +/- 5%), and phospho-ERK1/2 levels were normalized in rats exposed to pre-ischemic treadmill training (52 +/- 6%) relative to MCAO without exercise (69% +/- 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parallel effects were observed on striatal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> overflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that pre-ischemic treadmill training might induce neuroprotection by inhibiting the phospho-ERK1/2 over-activation and reducing excessive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
