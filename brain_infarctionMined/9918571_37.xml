<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug effects on brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes evoked by transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and by permanent MCAO were determined in vivo by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and post mortem by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining and histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drugs binding to FKBP12 and inhibiting calcineurin, such as FK506 and SDZ ASM 981, dose dependently reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, determined 48 h after MCAO by both magnetic resonance imaging and triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining but only in the transient MCAO model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo potencies to reduce brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> paralleled the in vitro potencies to inhibit calcineurin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological staining after 6 days of survival showed that the neuroprotective effects were permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi>, known to bind with similar affinity to FKBP12 but not to inhibit calcineurin, was not neuroprotective but abolished the neuroprotective effects of FK506 when coadministered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the permanent MCAO models, FK506 showed no effect when injected before and little effect when injected after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurements of core temperatures after MCAO in controls and drug-treated rats do not support <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> being the mechanism responsible for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that drugs inhibiting calcineurin activity are neuroprotective in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion but not in permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models, possibly by preventing reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
