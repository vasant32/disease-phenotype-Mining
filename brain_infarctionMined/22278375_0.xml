<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Elderly patients with multiple infarctions revealed a high prevalence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, postoperative neurological complications and characteristics of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) have not been evaluated in elderly patients undergoing CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred forty-nine patients (â‰¥60 years old) scheduled for CABG underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography preoperatively to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> and carotid and intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta was assessed by epiaortic ultrasound during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were sorted by their history of cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) and the presence of infarction by MRI: SBI (infarction without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), BI (symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and infarction), and controls (no findings of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or infarction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SBI was found in 35.5% of the 449 patients and increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of pre-existing multiple infarctions was less frequent in SBI than in BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> was 1.3% and 4.9% in controls (n = 225), 5.7% and 15.2% in SBI (n = 158), and 9.1% and 18.2% in BI (n = 66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with SBI were older and had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta, and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> were associated significantly with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with SBI were ranked at moderate risk of neurological complications after CABG between control and BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> appeared to be strongly associated with SBI </plain></SENT>
