<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is a major risk factor and also common amongst the people who suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the neuroprotective potential of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> 4-phenylbutyrate (SPB; 30-300mg/kg), a chemical chaperone by targeting ER stress in a rat model of transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> associated with comorbid type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal treatment with SPB (100 and 300mg/kg) significantly ameliorated brain I/R damage as evidenced by reduction in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also significantly improved the functional recovery of various neurobehavioral impairments (neurological deficit score, grip strength and rota rod) evoked by I/R compared with vehicle-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, SPB (100mg/kg) significantly reduced the DNA fragmentation as shown by prominent reduction in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was observed concomitantly with significant attenuation in upregulation of 78kDa <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> regulated protein (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153) and activation of caspase-12, specific markers of ER stress/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotection observed with SPB was independent of its effect on cerebral blood flow and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of SPB owing to amelioration of ER stress and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also suggest that targeting ER stress might offer a promising therapeutic approach and benefits against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> associated with comorbid type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
