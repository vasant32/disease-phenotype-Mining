<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to determine the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the influence of vascular risk factors and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in a representative sample of Spanish patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A consecutive sample of 100 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> or both were included in the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a potential source of emboli from the heart were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As main baseline variables, we considered vascular risk factors; complete cardiological study, including coronary angiography; brain computed tomography (CT) to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; echo-Doppler of supra-aortic vessels to detect stenosis; and carotid angiography, when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the outcome variable, we observed the incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after an 18 month mean follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in 30 patients (93% were of lacunar type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the vascular risk factors was related to brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> either in univariate or multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was the only significant predictor in a model of logistic regression (P &lt; 0.0005), although the lesions were bilateral in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed a very low incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after a mean follow-up of 18 months </plain></SENT>
