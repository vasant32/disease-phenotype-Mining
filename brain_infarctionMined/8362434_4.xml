<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Possible effects of changes in blood pressure on the cerebral circulation were studied in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and age-matched nonstroke control subjects at 28 +/- 10 months (mean +/- SD) (range, 18 to 54 months) and 27 +/- 6 months (range, 19 to 44 months), respectively, after the first measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral blood flow was measured by the 133Xe inhalation method in 55 patients (mean +/- SD age, 62 +/- 11 years; 39 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 16 with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>) and 10 control subjects (mean +/- SD age, 61 +/- 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlations between changes in cerebral blood flow and blood pressure were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e>, average cerebral blood flow did not change from the first study; however, changes in cerebral blood flow in each individual were closely related to changes in systolic and mean arterial blood pressures (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, in 10 patients with cerebral blood flow decreased more than 15% from the initial levels, systolic and mean arterial blood pressures decreased by 25 +/- 32 mm Hg and 16 +/- 14 mm Hg (P &lt; .05 and P &lt; .005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in 29 patients with unchanged or increased cerebral blood flow, changes in systolic (0 +/- 19 or -2 +/- 12 mm Hg, respectively) and mean arterial blood pressures (3 +/- 22 or -1 +/- 11 mm Hg, respectively) were not significant, and their systolic blood pressure levels were maintained above 110 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure importantly correlates with cerebral circulatory changes among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early detection of cerebral hemodynamic changes should be useful for determining the most favorable levels of blood pressure and for selecting appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
