<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most of the data rely exclusively on the assessment of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, which is only a partial predictor of the neurological outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have validated the model using a multimodal approach for the assessment of neuroprotection, which includes (i) determination of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining; (ii) an in-depth behavioral analysis of the neurological deficit; and (iii) an EEG analysis of electrophysiological abnormalities in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> somatosensory forelimb cortical area, S1FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The non-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801 (3 mg/kg, injected i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>20 min after ET1 infusion in conscious rats) could reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, reverse the EEG changes occurring at early times post-ET1, and markedly improve the neurological deficit in ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter effect, however, was visible at day 3 post-ET1, because the drug itself produced substantial behavioral abnormalities at earlier times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a multimodal approach can be applied to the ET1 model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and that MK-801 can be used as a reference compound to which the activity of safer neuroprotective drugs should be compared </plain></SENT>
