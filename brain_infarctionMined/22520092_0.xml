<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KDR genes are associated with increased risk of SBI in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 383 patients with SBI and 387 controls were genotyped for the KDR -604T&gt;C, 1192G&gt;A, and 1719A&gt;T SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We separately analyzed this association according to the age (ageâ‰¥65 and age&lt;65) and the gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared haplotype frequencies between SBI patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotype frequencies for three SNPs did not differ significantly between SBI patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, haplotype analysis for three SNPs did not show a difference between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of genotype of KDR -604T&gt;C was significantly associated with an increased risk of SBI in the age&lt;65 years old group (AOR=1.515, 95% CI, 1.003 to 2.289, p=0.048) and in male group (AOR=1.596, 95% CI, 1.018 to 2.503, p=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KDR -604T&gt;C SNP may serve as genetic markers for the increased risk of SBI among the younger (&lt;65 years) or male only Korean subpopulations </plain></SENT>
