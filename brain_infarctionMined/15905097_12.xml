<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the molecular basis of this mechanism of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we explored the expression and localization of Smac/DIABLO, a newly identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> apoptogenic molecule, and XAF1, a recently identified <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of XIAP anti-caspase activity in the rat brain following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced for 90 min in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed changes in the expression of Smac, XAF1, and XIAP during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression level of Smac/DIABLO was negligible under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions and was moderately increased by 6-24 h reperfusion on both immunohistochemical and Western blotting levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In opposition to the orthodox method of Western blotting employing electrophoretic analysis and homogenization, the immunohistochemical investigations of XIAP provided spatial information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the subcellular localization of XIAP became more extensive within cells during reperfusion, as compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, XIAP was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post-reperfusion, XIAP exhibited a diffuse distribution, including nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of XAF1 exhibited significant changes during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>XAF1 expression was increased and there was a cellular redistribution with a nuclear localization in the post-ischemic phase by 6-24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>XAF1 expression apparently enhances neuronal susceptibility to degeneration either by suppressing the ability of XIAP to complex with caspases or by sequestering XIAP in nuclear inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These finding indicate that Smac/DIABLO, XAF1, and XIAP are implicated in the pathophysiological mechanisms of reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
