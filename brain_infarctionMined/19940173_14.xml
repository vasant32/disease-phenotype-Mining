<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many approaches have been tested for preventing production of ROSs by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase in ischemic brain injury, the regulatory mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a critical modulator of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase and elucidated the role of CK2 as a neuroprotectant after oxidative insults to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the protein levels of the catalytic subunits CK2alpha and CK2alpha', as well as the total activity of CK2, are significantly reduced after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tFCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found this deactivation of CK2 caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion increases expression of Nox2 and translocation of p67(phox) and Rac1 to the membrane after tFCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that the inactive status of Rac1 was captured by the catalytic subunit CK2alpha under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, binding between CK2alpha and Rac1 was immediately diminished after tFCI, and Rac1 activity was markedly increased after CK2 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that deactivation of CK2 in the mouse brain enhances production of ROSs and neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume caused by CK2 inhibition was restored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that CK2 can be a direct molecular target for modulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity after ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
