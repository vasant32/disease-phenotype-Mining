<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with large vessel occlusion but no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> performed a simple motor task with the hand contralateral to the occluded vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Statistical parametric maps of regional activity were generated to compare the distribution of motor-related activity among patients with that of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal cerebral hemodynamics on the basis of intracerebral vasomotor reactivity using transcranial Doppler and carbon dioxide inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls and patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vasomotor reactivity showed typical motor activity in contralateral motor areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the 9 patients with abnormal vasomotor reactivity were compared with the 14 control subjects in a single analysis, unique motor activation was identified in ipsilateral motor regions in the nonhypoperfused hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a confirmatory analysis, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity was averaged in prespecified motor regions of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant group by hemisphere interaction was identified, driven by higher ipsilateral and lower contralateral hemisphere BOLD signal in patients with abnormal vasomotor reactivity compared with controls (F=12.40, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average ipsilateral motor region signal intensity was also significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with abnormal vasoreactivity and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> compared with controls (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that hemodynamic impairment in one hemisphere, even in the absence of any focal lesion or any symptoms can be associated with a functional reorganization to the opposite hemisphere </plain></SENT>
