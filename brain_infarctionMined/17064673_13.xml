<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) has been reported to protect against ischemic injury in the brains of young adult rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about whether FGF-2 retains this capability in the aged ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in human is much more common in older people than among younger adults, to address this question is clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, aged (24-month-old) rats were treated with intracerebroventricular infusion of FGF-2 or vehicle for 3 days, beginning 48 h before (pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), 24 h after (early post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), or 96 h after (late post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) 60 min of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and were killed 10 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aged rats given FGF-2 pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> showed better symmetry of movement and forepaw outstretching, and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes, compared to rats treated with vehicle, but no significant improvement was found in aged rats given FGF-2 after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, young adult (3-month-old) rats treated with FGF-2 for 3 days beginning 24 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> showed significant neurobehavioral improvement and better histological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also found that newborn neurons in the rostral subventricular zone (SVZ) were increased in aged rats treated with FGF-2 prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, unlike in young adult ischemic rats, only a few of newly generated cells migrated into the damaged region in aged brain after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings point to differences in the response of aged versus young adult rats to FGF-2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and suggest that such differences need to be considered in the development of neuroprotective agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
