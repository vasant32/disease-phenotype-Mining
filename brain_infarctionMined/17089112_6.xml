<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Our purpose was to study the association between the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcifications</z:hpo> observed on head CT and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> demonstrated by MRI in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study which included 65 consecutive patients presenting acutely who had both head CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>Arterial calcifications</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar system and the intracranial cavernous carotid arteries (intracranial carotid artery calcification, ICAC) were assigned a number (1 to 4) in the bone window images from CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These four groups were then combined into high calcium (grades 3 and 4) and low calcium (grades 1 and 2) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI was independently evaluated to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> large-vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LVI) and small-vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between ICAC and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was evaluated before and after adjusting for demographics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistical analysis could not be performed for the vertebrobasilar system due to an insufficient number of patients in the high calcium group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 65 patients, 46 (71%) had a high ICAC grade on head CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were older and had a higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> SVI (P = 0.006), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> SVI (P = 0.006) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> LVI (P = 0.04) were associated with a high ICAC grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and other risk factors, only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SVI was associated with a high ICAC grade (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although age emerged as the most important determinant of ischemic cerebral changes, there were rather complex interactions among multiple risk factors with different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A high ICAC grade demonstrated a correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SVI in our patients independent of these risk factors </plain></SENT>
