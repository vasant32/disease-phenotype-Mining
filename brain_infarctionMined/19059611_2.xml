<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between light to moderate alcohol intake and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI), white matter lesions (WMLs), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cranial MRI was performed on subjects&gt;or=40 years residing in a rural community in Japan (n=385; mean age, 67.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alcohol intake and type was determined using a detailed questionnaire; subjects were categorized into three groups: non-drinkers, light drinkers (&lt;7 drinks per week), and moderate drinkers (&gt;or=7 drinks per week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Former drinkers were considered non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Periventricular WMLs, deep WMLs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> were measured quantitatively using a computer-assisted processing system (%PVWML, %DWML, and %Brain, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with non-drinkers, the prevalence odds ratios for SBI were significantly higher in light and moderate drinkers, after multivariate adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, and other related factors, the geometric mean %PVWML volumes in light and moderate drinkers were 1.27% and 1.52%, respectively, significantly larger than those for non-drinkers (0.95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The geometric mean %DWML volume in light drinkers was 0.10%, which was larger than the value for non-drinkers (0.06%); the value for moderate drinkers (0.13%) was significantly larger than that for non-drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The geometric mean %Brain values for non-, light, and moderate drinkers were 92.1, 91.9 and 90.8%, respectively; a statistically significant difference was found between non-drinkers and moderate drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that regular drinking, including even low levels of consumption, may be a risk factor for subclinical findings detected on MRI in community-dwelling Japanese people </plain></SENT>
