<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, we explored the effects of leptin on neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neural stem cells (NSC) were grown as neurospheres in culture and treated with vehicle or leptin and neurosphere size and terminal differentiation were then determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then explored the effects of leptin on endogenous repair mechanisms in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sabra mice underwent photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were given vehicle or leptin and newborn cells were labeled with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">Bromo</z:chebi>-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">Uridine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was studied with the neurological severity score for 90 days post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the brains were then evaluated with immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subset of animals the brains were also evaluated for changes in the expression of leptin receptor and AMPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, leptin led to a 2-fold increase in neurosphere size but did not change the differentiation of newborn cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, exogenous leptin led to a 4-fold increase in the number of NSC in the cortex abutting the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a 1.5-fold increase in the number of newborn neurons and glia in leptin treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Leptin also significantly increased the number of blood vessels in the peri-lesioned cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Leptin treated mice had increased expression of leptin receptor and increased phosphorylated AMPK concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with leptin also had significantly better functional states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, leptin induces neurogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and leads to increased leptin receptor and pAMPK concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This may explain at least in part the better functional outcome observed in leptin treated animals after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
