<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only very little information is available on their quantitative relevance for the pathophysiology and final outcome of diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of oxygen radicals in the pathogenesis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose a rat model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of three vitamin E deficient groups were repleted with different dosages of DL-alpha-tocopherylacetate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100513'>vitamin E deficiency</z:hpo> could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> during repletion was increased in the vitamin E repleted groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was created by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for two hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 24 hours the measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of the group with the highest repletion dosage was significantly reduced by 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was also expressed in a higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbances</z:hpo> after MCAO of the deficient animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The control of vitamin E status exhibited a similar repletion-dependent level in plasma and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results strongly support the hypothesis that the generation of oxygen radicals occurring during reperfusion is an important aspect of the pathophysiological mechanism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
