<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to increase reproducibility and decrease SAH using a modification of the Koizumi suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared a Koizumi 5/0 Ethilon poly-l-lysine-coated suture (s-2, group B) to an identical, uncoated one (s-1, group A) and the Belayev's 3/0 suture (s-3, group C), in the 2-h MCAO model in Wistar rats of varying weight (310-527 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessment included successful infarction rates, the modified neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (mNSS), a modified Bederson's scale (mBS), the grid-walking test (GWT), infarction volume (with rostrocaudal subanalysis and analysis of cortical/striatal involvement) and hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The s-2 suture increased the successful MCAO from 61.1% and 66.6% (groups A and C) to 97.5% in group B and induced a more severe clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) irrespective of animal's weight, with no incidence of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume and ipsilateral hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased and well correlated with the mNSS (P&lt;or=0.005), the mBS (P&lt;or=0.01) and GWT outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the new modified suture induces a more reproducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in Wistar rats for temporary-MCAO experiments, overcoming the variability of weight and the risk of SAH </plain></SENT>
