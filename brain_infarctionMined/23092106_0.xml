<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the necessity for an air vent from the vein graft and explain its use in our two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Case 1, we searched for a great saphenous vein around its junction with a femoral vein during the harvest of vein graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An accessory branch of that great saphenous vein was also found around the junctional region with a femoral vein, and was temporarily ligated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At first, anastomosis was completed on both the distal and proximal sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the proximal side of a vein graft was opened and the ligation of the branch was loosened, an air vent could be made through the branch of the vein graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple air bubbles and a large quantity of white microemboli were discharged through this branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Case 2, the air vent was omitted to shorten <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the opening of the vein graft, the migrated air was observed to move to the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography scan demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> occurred postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The air vent of the vein graft is essential in extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery, because the air bubbles or microthrombi are easily trapped around the valve and cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An air vent can be easily made if the branch of a vein graft exists in the outflow pathway, because intraluminal air or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> can be washed out through the branch at the final stage of surgery </plain></SENT>
