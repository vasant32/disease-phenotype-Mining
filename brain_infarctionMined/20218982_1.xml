<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coated-platelets, representing a subset of platelets with procoagulant potential, are elevated in patients with non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and decreased in patients with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, within the non-lacunar patient population there are individuals with lower levels of coated-platelets, which raises the possibility that these individuals would be susceptible to early hemorrhagic transformation (HT) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because extremes in coated-platelet potential may be associated with either thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, we undertook a pilot study to investigate whether there is an association between coated-platelet production and the presence of early HT in patients with non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Coated-platelet levels were determined in 115 consecutive eligible patients with a diagnosis of non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early HT was determined on CT scan examination and confirmed by MRI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of coated-platelet levels was summarized using the median and interquartile range (25th-75th percentiles) and compared statistically between patients with and without early HT using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median coated-platelet level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was 38.0% (interquartile range 30.5-48.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early HT was detected in 11 patients (9.6%), and these patients had significantly lower coated-platelet levels compared with those without early HT [median 25.1% (interquartile range 20.4-35.5%) vs. 39.2% (31.6-49.5%), P = 0.003] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of coated-platelets are associated with the presence of early HT in patients with non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
