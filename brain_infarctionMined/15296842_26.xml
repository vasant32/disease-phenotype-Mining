<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> on ischemic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-like insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary cortical neuronal cultures were subjected to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-like injury, and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> before or at the start of OGD, or upon reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was reduced when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> was present during OGD, and this protection was associated with a reduction of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS), but not inducible NOS (iNOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protection by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> was also studied at the in vivo level using a model of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to 2 h MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">Agmatine</z:chebi> was administered either 30 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, at the start of MCAO, at the start of reperfusion, or 2 or 5 h into reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">Agmatine</z:chebi> markedly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups except when treatment was delayed 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of nNOS immunopositive cells was correlated with neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, immunoreactivity for iNOS was reduced only when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> was administered before and at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17431">agmatine</z:chebi> may be a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce cerebral ischemic injury, and may act by inhibiting the detrimental effects of nNOS </plain></SENT>
