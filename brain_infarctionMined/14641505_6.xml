<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a cohort of 435 consecutive prevalent cases of BI (including both recurrent and first-ever BI) we collected medical and socio-economic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Handicap was measured with the Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only the direct medical costs were considered over an 18-month period from a societal perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared first-ever to recurrent BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 435 patients 20.5% had a recurrent BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The length of the initial hospitalization and the distribution of the patients into the three classes of handicap (Rankin 0-2, 3, and 4-5) were similar in the first-ever and recurrent BI groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average total cost of a first-ever BI was euro 19 725 (95% CI, 17 950-21 501) and euro 18 560 (95% CI, 15 798-21 322) for a recurrent BI (P = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the two groups when the costs were compared by handicap levels (P = 0.17) or when the costs were compared for each type of expenditure (initial hospitalization, rehabilitation, ambulatory services) except for long-term care, because of the small number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the costs of recurrent BI are roughly similar to the costs of first-ever BI, which may be helpful when studying the cost-effectiveness of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention trials </plain></SENT>
