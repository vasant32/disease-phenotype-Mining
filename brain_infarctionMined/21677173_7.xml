<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although caspase-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is thought to play a prominent role in neuronal injury, direct evidence of active initiator caspases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the functional relevance of this activity have not previously been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an unbiased caspase-trapping technique in vivo, we isolated active caspase-9 from ischemic rat brain within 1 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic relevance of active caspase-9 was shown by intranasal delivery of a novel cell membrane-penetrating highly specific inhibitor for active caspase-9 at 4 h postreperfusion (hpr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caspase-9 inhibition provided neurofunctional protection and established caspase-6 as its downstream target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The temporal and spatial pattern of expression demonstrates that neuronal caspase-9 activity induces caspase-6 activation, mediating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003447'>axonal loss</z:hpo> by 12 hpr followed by neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 24 hpr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results support selective inhibition of these specific caspases as an effective therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
