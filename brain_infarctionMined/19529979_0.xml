<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: For diagnosing patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, non-invasive count-based method with (15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> and H (2) (15) O <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (PET) data is widely used to measure asymmetric increases in oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For shortening study time, we have proposed dual-tracer autoradiographic (DARG) protocol in which (15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> gas and C(15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> gas are sequentially administrated within short period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we evaluated feasibility of the non-invasive count-based method with the DARG protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients [67.8 +/- 9.9 (mean +/- SD) years] with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were examined by the use of measurements of asymmetric OEF elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As DARG protocol, (15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> and C(15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> gases were inhaled with 5-min interval and dynamic PET data were acquired for 8 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative OEF (qOEF) image was computed with PET data and arterial input function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ratio image of (15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> and C(15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> phases of PET data was computed as count-based OEF (cbOEF) image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The asymmetric indices (AI) of qOEF (qOEF-AI) and cbOEF (cbOEF-AI) were obtained from regions of interest symmetric placed on left and right sides of cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To optimize the summation time of PET data for the cbOEF image, qOEF and cbOEF images with various summation times were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Image quality of cbOEF image was better than that of qOEF image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best correlation coefficient of 0.94 was obtained when the cbOEF image was calculated from 0 to 180 s of (15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> summed image and 340 to 440 s of C(15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> summed image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using the appropriate summation time, we obtained the cbOEF image with good correlation with qOEF image, which suggests non-invasive cbOEF image can be used for evaluating the degree of misery perfusion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The count-based method with DARG protocol has a potential to dramatically reduce the examination time of (15)O PET study </plain></SENT>
