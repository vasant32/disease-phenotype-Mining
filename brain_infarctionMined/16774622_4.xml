<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The present study investigated the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, validated the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in lacunar patients, and identified predictors of such deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> performed a comprehensive cognitive screening between day 2 and day 7 of their stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The test battery included Trail Making Test A, Verbal Fluency, Object Learning Test, Ullev√•l <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>Aphasia</z:hpo> Screening, and Assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and other Brain Damage regarding motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo>, rational <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> and visuospatial ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exactly 57.7% scored outside cutoff in at least one of the cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a rigorous cutoff for MMSE (28/29 points) and the test battery as comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of MMSE were 0.69 and 0.67, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only male sex was significantly related to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> (pathologic score on at least one of the tests--odds ratio 4.41, 95% confidence interval 1.45-13.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Many lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients suffer cognitive problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male patients are at particular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MMSE failed to identify 30% of the patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, and we suggest that lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients be offered a comprehensive cognitive screening, even when MMSE is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
