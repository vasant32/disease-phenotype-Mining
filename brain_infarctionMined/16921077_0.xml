<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with one of five classic lacunar syndromes underwent DWI as primary imaging modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DWI findings were classified into groups: (a) having a lesion with high signal intensity, (b) having a lesion with mixed signal intensity, and (c) unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final clinical diagnoses were extracted from the patients' medical records, and used as a reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 151 DWI images, 120 (79%) were interpreted as high signal lesions, 21 (14%) as mixed signal lesions, and 10 (7%) as unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with high signal lesions or unremarkable findings were diagnosed with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with mixed signal lesions were diagnosed with haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with an exception of one ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary DWI is a feasible and useful neuroimaging tool for patients with lacunar syndrome in the ED </plain></SENT>
