<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a strong risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it is still unclear whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, severity, and prognosis are different in diabetic and nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> features, prognosis, and functional outcome in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a European Union Concerted Action involving 7 countries and 4537 patients hospitalized for a first-in-a-lifetime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, defined according to the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project criteria, we collected data on demographics, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and outcome at 3 months (disability, handicap, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>), controlling for risk factors, clinical presentation, and demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was present in 937 patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diabetic patients, compared with those without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001), and lacunar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, the case fatality rates were not higher in the diabetic groups (P=0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Handicap (Rankin Scale) and disability (Barthel Index) were significantly higher in diabetic patients (P=0.005 and P=0.016, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in diabetic patients has a specific clinical pattern and a poor prognosis in terms of motor function, which emphasizes the need for early diagnosis and treatment of every case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
