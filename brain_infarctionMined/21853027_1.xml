<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The excitotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> are a major contributor to the pathogenesis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine if overexpression of a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter (GLT-1) reduces ischemic brain injury in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated an adeno-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> (AAV) vector expressing the rat GLT-1 cDNA (AAV-GLT1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional expression of AAV-GLT1 was confirmed by increased <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> clearance rate in non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat brain as measured by in vivo amperometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AAV-GLT1 was injected into future cortical region of infarction 3 weeks prior to 60 min middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue damage was assessed at one and two days after MCAo using TUNEL and TTC staining, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral testing was performed at 2, 8 and 14 days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animals receiving AAV-GLT1, compared to AAV-GFP, showed significant decreases in the duration and magnitude of extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, measured by microdialysis, during the 60 minute MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and DNA fragmentation was observed in the region of AAV-GLT1 injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals that received AAV-GLT1 showed significant improvement in behavioral recovery following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared to the AAV-GFP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that focal overexpression of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter, GLT-1, significantly reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> overflow, decreases cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and improves behavioral recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data further support the role of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of ischemic damage in brain and demonstrate that targeted gene delivery to decrease the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> overflow reduces the cellular and behavioral deficits caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
