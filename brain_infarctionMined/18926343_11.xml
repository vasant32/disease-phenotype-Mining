<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-modified albumin (IMA) is a useful marker for the diagnosis of ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was also recently demonstrated that IMA levels increase in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet the data regarding IMA levels in various types of cerebrovascular events are insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate IMA levels in various types of cerebrovascular events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This case-controlled study consisted of 106 consecutive patients, 43 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI), 11 with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), 52 with SAH, and a 43-member control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether there was a statistical correlation between these 3 groups and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relations among the 3 groups were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparisons among groups were done with analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum IMA levels were 0.280 +/- 0.045 absorbance units (ABSU) for BI patients, 0.259 +/- 0.053 ABSU for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients, 0.243 +/- 0.061 ABSU for SAH patients, and 0.172 +/- 0.045 ABSU for the control group.There was a statistically significant difference between the mean IMA levels of BI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, and SAH patients and the mean control patient IMA levels (P b .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-modified albumin levels are high in cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-modified albumin measurement can also be used to distinguish SAH from BI during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of cerebrovascular event in the emergency department </plain></SENT>
