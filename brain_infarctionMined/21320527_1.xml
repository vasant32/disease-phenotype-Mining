<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) rat model that involves a unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery followed by a 60 min period of 8% oxygen <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is often used to test proposed treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this HI protocol produces inconsistent infarction volumes due to the variability of individual rats to compensate for the ligated artery and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this HI model is problematic for experiments that prevent measurement of infarction volume, such as those that require analysis of homogenised brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore aimed to find a simple and non-invasive predictor of infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Observations made prior, during and following HI in p26 rats showed that weight change 24 h following surgery was a strong predictor of infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of a tonic clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was highly correlated with success of inducing an infarction, and for this reason we assessed whether ceasing the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> for each rat following a tonic clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> would produce a more consistent infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using this procedure, infarction volumes measured at 3 and 15 days after surgery were significantly less variable, resulting in considerable improvements in statistical power compared with the original model </plain></SENT>
