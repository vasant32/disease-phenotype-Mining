<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunctioning (CDF) is an important issue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, interfering with recovery and social dysfunctioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the clinical and imaging correlates of CDF in patients with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated CDF 15 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a prospective cohort of consecutive patients with a Mini Mental State Examination score &gt; or =23 using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CDF was ranked into 3 categories according to Z scores calculated for each test and adjusted for age and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CDF was analyzed in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging was assessed using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An ordinal regression procedure was used to determine the clinical correlates of CDF and to compute probabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cognitive evaluation was achieved in 177 consecutive patients (age 50.0 +/- 16.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In bivariate analysis, CDF was associated with age, low level of education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, neurological deficit at day 15, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, arterial territory and leukoaraiosis but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume or location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predictors of CDF were NIHSS score at day 15 (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.05-1.73), middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (OR = 2.96; 95% CI = 1.30-6.73), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> interacting with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> side (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03-1.15), and female gender interacting with high level of education (OR = 0.209; 95% CI = 0.085-0.514) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> features correlate with CDF in nondemented patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These simple criteria may help to predict CDF at bedside in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to recommend a neuropsychological evaluation for patients' management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Modeling CDF soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using simple neurological criteria may be a useful tool for designing clinical trials </plain></SENT>
