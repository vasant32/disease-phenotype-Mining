<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Computed tomography examinations, including non-contrast enhanced CT, CT perfusion and CT angiography, were performed on 24 patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in less than 9 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was analysed on arterial and venous phase CT perfusion source images and then compared with the ASPECTS on follow-up imaging for an efficacy assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ASPECTS on arterial phase CT perfusion source images was significantly different from venous phase CT perfusion source images (z=-2.812, p=0.005); linear regression analysis revealed that there was a statistically significant relationship between venous phase CT perfusion source images and the follow-up imaging (beta=0.715, p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The limited data suggested that CT perfusion source images of both arterial and venous phases may have the potential of being used as an assessment for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and penumbra in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
