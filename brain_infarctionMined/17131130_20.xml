<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Old age is associated with a deficient recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the cellular mechanisms underlying such phenomena are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by reversible occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in 3- and 20-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aged rats showed a delayed and suboptimal functional recovery in the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using BrdU-labeling, quantitative immunohistochemistry and 3-D reconstruction of confocal images, we found that aged rats are predisposed to rapidly develop an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> within the first few days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The emergence of the necrotic zone is associated with a high rate of cellular degeneration, premature accumulation of proliferating BrdU-positive cells that appear to emanate from capillaries in the infarcted area, and a large number of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With double labeling techniques, we were able to identify, for the first time, over 60% of BrdU-positive cells either as reactive microglia (45%), oligodendrocyte progenitors (17%), astrocytes (23%), CD8+ lymphocytes (4%), or apoptotic cells (&lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, despite a robust reactive phenotype of microglia and astrocytes in aged rats, at 1-week post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the number of proliferating microglia and astrocytes was lower in aged rats than in young rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that aging is associated with rapid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> development and a poor prognosis for full recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that is correlated with premature cellular proliferation and increased cellular degeneration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the infarcted area </plain></SENT>
