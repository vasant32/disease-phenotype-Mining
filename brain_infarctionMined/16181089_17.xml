<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if exercise could induce expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 1 and 2, in association with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>; and if angiogenic changes correlated with reduced brain injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (3 month old, n=44) were exercised on a treadmill 30 minutes each day for 1, 3 or 6 weeks, or housed as non-exercised controls for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some 3 week-exercised rats were then housed for an additional 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exercise significantly (p&lt;0.01) increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) expression of angiopoietin 1 and 2 as early as 1 week, with further increases occurring at 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mild increase after 1 week and a robust increase after 3 weeks of exercise in four isoforms (120, 144, 164, 188) of VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly (p&lt;0.01) observed, with VEGF(144) being more markedly up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> decreased upon withdrawal of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase (p&lt;0.01) in the density of microvessels (determined by laminin-immunocytochemistry) was found at 3 weeks of exercise and this continued after exercise was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In exercising rats subjected to 2-h <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion followed by 48-h reperfusion, neurological deficits and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection continued after 3 weeks of rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that pre-ischemic exercise reduces brain injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduced damage is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, possibly induced by angiogenic factors following exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physical exercise up-regulates <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of the angiopoietin family and VEGF </plain></SENT>
