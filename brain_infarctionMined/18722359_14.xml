<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the comparative therapeutic benefits of multiple injections of hMSCs at different time points after cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats using intra-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, and infused hMSCs intravenously at a single 6 h time point (low and high cell doses) and various multiple time points after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From MRI analyses lesion volume was reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hMSC cell injection groups as compared to serum alone injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the greatest therapeutic benefit was achieved following a single high cell dose injection at 6 h post-MCAO, rather than multiple lower cell infusions over multiple time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional analysis of capillary vessels in the lesion indicated that the capillary volume was equally increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cell-injected groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, differences in functional outcome in the hMSC transplantation subgroups are not likely the result of differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, but rather from differences in neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
