<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, there was a mean difference in survival in the control versus the alcoholic gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas 76% of controls survived the operation, only 55% of alcoholic gerbils survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the alcoholic gerbils died earlier, usually in the initial 3 postoperation days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was identical (52%) in both control and alcohol-treated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a difference in the extent (size) of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and tolerance to them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The alcoholic gerbils tended to develop either large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> which were usually lethal, or smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but with decreased tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the controls tended to be smaller with better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> alcohol consumption contributes significantly to the risk of mortality associated with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> reported in human alcoholics, and indicate that the alcoholic gerbil is a good experimental model to study the pathophysiology of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
