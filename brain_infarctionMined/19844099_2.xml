<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous data are conflicting as to whether imbalance between hemostatic factors is associated with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between hemostatic factor levels and subclinical lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in a nested sample from a subset of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 196 cases without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by MRI, and 214 controls without radiographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were frequency-matched by age group and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association between levels of hemostatic markers and case status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In age-, race- and sex-adjusted models, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) and D-dimer were positively associated with case status, with odds ratios for the highest vs. lowest tertile of 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.6) for vWF and 1.76 (95% CI 1.02-3.0) for D-dimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen had nonsignificant inverse associations with presence of silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: vWF and D-dimer were positively associated, and plasminogen was nonsignificantly inversely associated with subclinical radiographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the role of these hemostatic factors in the development of silent lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may help elucidate the mechanisms behind this injury and may even point to potential targets for future intervention </plain></SENT>
