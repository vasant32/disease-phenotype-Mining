<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the role of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been controversial, with some studies suggesting that preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> accounts for most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased IL-6 could signal the involvement of antiinflammatory activity, since IL-6 stimulates the production of endogenous antiinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1RA) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-1RA and IL-6 were both significantly correlated with levels of CRP, p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively, but not with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-6 and IL-1RA, together with fibrinogen and CRP were higher in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of greater than 3 cm and lowest in patients with lacunar syndromes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
