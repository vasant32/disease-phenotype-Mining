<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rare incidence and various surgical techniques applied have limited the clinical research on MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the surgical outcome of 410 pediatric MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated in a relatively uniform scheme at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures consisted of bilateral encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis augmented by bifrontal encephalogaleo-/periosteal synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were applied to reveal the prognostic factors for surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall clinical outcome was excellent in 66%, good in 15%, fair in 15%, and poor in 4% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 81% of the patients had a favorable clinical outcome (excellent and good) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses revealed that infarction on presentation was associated with unfavorable clinical outcome (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-5.46; p &lt; 0.01) and decreased vascular reserve only on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.52; p &lt; 0.01), with favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that an early diagnosis and active intervention before establishment of irreversible hemodynamic change are essential to achieve a favorable clinical outcome in children with MMD </plain></SENT>
