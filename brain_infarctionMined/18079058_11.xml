<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found elevation of extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentration associated with concomitant downregulation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters following rat microsphere embolism (ME) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A marked increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in the rat striatum was observed by microdialysis immediately after ME induction, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> remained elevated at least 12h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, impairment of high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> (146 mM)-induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release was observed in the striatum 12h after ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the persistent increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, expression of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters EAAC1 and GLT-1 significantly decreased 6h after insult without a change in GLAST levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GLT-1 expression was restored to basal levels within 48 h, whereas EAAC1 expression remained decreased up to at least 72 h after ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restoration of GLT-1 was associated with increased expression of the astroglial marker GFAP, whereas markedly reduced EACC1 levels were correlated with reduced levels of the neuronal marker MAP2, likely due to loss of vulnerable neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, downregulation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters after ME is associated with dysregulation of basal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release in the brain </plain></SENT>
