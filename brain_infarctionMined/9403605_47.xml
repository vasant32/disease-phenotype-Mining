<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch has been found to be associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that atherosclerotic plaques &gt; or = 4 mm in thickness in the ascending aorta and proximal arch detected by transesophageal echocardiography are a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact, if any, of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (ulceration, hypoechoic plaques or calcification) on the risk of subsequent vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed for a period of 2 to 4 years, a cohort of 334 patients 60 years or older who were consecutively admitted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and who had transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of vascular events in patients with plaques in the aortic arch according to the presence of surface ulceration, calcifications, and sessile or mobile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was estimated during a total of 788 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypoechoic plaques, calcifications, and ulceration were more frequently found in patients with plaques &gt; or = 4 mm as compared with those with plaques &lt; 4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of ulceration did not increase the relative risk of vascular events in patients with plaque &gt; or = 4 mm (the relative risk was 4.3 [P&lt;.001] in those with ulceration and 5.7 [P&lt;.001]) in those without ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lack of calcification did increase the risk of vascular events in patients with plaque &gt; or = 4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest relative risk of events was found among the patients with noncalcified plaques (relative risk, 10.3; 95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 25.2; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of events was systematically higher in patients without calcifications than in patients with calcifications regardless of what other morphological features were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, the risk associated with aortic plaque thickness (&gt; or = 4 mm) is markedly increased by the absence of plaque calcifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings are important for the design of therapeutic trials in such patients </plain></SENT>
