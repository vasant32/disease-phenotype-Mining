<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence and risk factors associated with MRI-demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in elderly subjects with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study, aged 65 years or more and without prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were studied with brain MRI (n=3456) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (&gt;/=3 mm) on MRI was determined in subjects with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (n=100) had a higher prevalence of MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (46% versus 28%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted odds ratio for having MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> was 2.20 (95% CI, 1.47 to 3.30) and remained significantly elevated after adjustments for risk factors and cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, diastolic blood pressure (P=0.01) and internal carotid artery intima-media thickness (P=0.01) were the only factors predictive of the presence of MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by stepwise logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are imaging manifestations of clinically important cerebrovascular disease in subjects with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, given their increased prevalence and positive association with increased diastolic blood pressure and internal carotid artery intima-media thickness </plain></SENT>
