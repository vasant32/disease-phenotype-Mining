<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) may be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition rather than a uniform disease entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop reliable tools that aid in identifying patients at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> populations with MCI to maximize the benefits of emerging therapies for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A 2-year prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Clinical follow-up in an outpatient memory clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy-two consecutive older patients with memory complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid tau levels, severity of periventricular and deep white matter lesions, silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on magnetic resonance imaging, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype, and other vascular risk factors were assessed at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were diagnosed as having amnestic MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients with (AD-converted MCI group) or without (progressive MCI group) conversion to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD progressed over time, whereas the other 16 patients remained cognitively stable (stable MCI group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stable MCI group was characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal fluid tau levels and a high grade of periventricular white matter lesions (PWMLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The progressive MCI and AD-converted MCI groups had increased cerebrospinal fluid tau levels and low grades of PWMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model showed that age was significantly associated with developing PWMLs (P =.03; odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tau-related AD pathologic conditions and possibly ischemic PWMLs represent 2 major etiologies in the development of MCI, reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the clinical progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the progressive type of MCI may be a primary target of clinical trials that aim at secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, these patients should be identified by appropriate biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques </plain></SENT>
