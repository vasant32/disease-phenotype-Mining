<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From 2001 to 2006, 40 patients underwent operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Right brachial artery perfusion was performed in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From May 2005, transesophageal echocardiography and cerebral oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy were continuously monitored during operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 3 in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 3 brain infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Switching of blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass occurred in 3 patients; 2 patients suffered from diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> while. in the other patient, switching of perfusion was detected at once by multi-monitoring and resolved by induction of right brachial artery perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Close monitoring of cerebral oxygenation by near infrared spectroscopy, transesophageal echocardiography and right brachial artery perfusion are effective in operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
