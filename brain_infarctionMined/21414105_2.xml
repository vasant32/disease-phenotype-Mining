<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous case series using the International Classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Disorders (ICHD) included &lt;10 cases which make conclusions less valid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to describe characteristics and outcome of MI in a larger sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed demographic data, risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> medication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> localization, symptoms, and outcome in a sample of 33 patients with MI according to second edition of the ICHD criteria collected from seven Nordic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst 33 patients with MI, there were 20 (61%) women and 13 (39%) men with the median age for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of 39 (range 19-76) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Traditional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were rare compared with Scandinavian young <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 12 (36%) patients used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4826">ergotamines</z:chebi> or triptans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was located in the posterior circulation in 27 (82%) patients and cerebellum was involved in 7 (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e>, the outcome was favorable with total recovery or limited residual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of traditional risk factors was low and the infarctions were predominantly located in posterior circulation territory, supporting theories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> specific mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome was in general favorable </plain></SENT>
