<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of stenosis and calcification was satisfactory, however that of ulceration was not sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stenotic lesions frequently existed in bilateral carotid arteries and the intima was easy to become thick even after the endoarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ultrasonogram was thought to be the essential study for the carotid artery lesions </plain></SENT>
