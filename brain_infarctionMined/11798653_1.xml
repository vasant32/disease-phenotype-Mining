<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24-hour dynamic electrocardiogram recordings was measured were performed in 74 patients with hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and in 39 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>Supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were significantly increased in groups of right insular infarction as compared with groups of lesions in other regions and with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased rate of ST segment abnormality was found in groups of left insular infarction as compared with groups of lesions in other regions and with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effect of hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on heart function are mainly correlated with destruction of insular or regions adjacent to the insular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> is associated with right insular infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While increased rate of ST segment abnormality is associated with left insular infarction </plain></SENT>
