<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the significance of vascular lesions as a cause of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>, we analyzed the symptomatic characteristics, the width of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) on MRI and the responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi> in 227 parkinsonian cases, excluding those with drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e> (IPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were classified into those without a significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia (n = 144), those with status lacunaris in the putamen (SLP; n = 66) and those with confluent white matter hyperintensity signals (CWMH; n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 4- to 6-Hz <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002396'>cogwheel rigidity</z:hpo> were significantly more frequent in cases without significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (69%) than those with SLP (50%) and those with CWMH (12%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among cases with 4- to 6-Hz <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002396'>cogwheel rigidity</z:hpo>, the frequency of patients with a reduced SNpc width and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi> responders did not significantly differ between those with SLP (73 and 83%, respectively) and those without significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (83 and 86%, respectively), suggesting that the diagnosis for most of these cases would be probable IPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among cases without 4- to 6-Hz <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002396'>cogwheel rigidity</z:hpo>, those with a reduced SNpc width or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-dopa</z:chebi> responders were significantly less frequent among cases with SLP (25 and 38%, respectively) than among those without significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (75 and 71%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with neither 4- to 6-Hz <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002396'>cogwheel rigidity</z:hpo> nor reduction in the SNpc width, for whom the probable diagnosis was vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> (VP), were significantly more frequent in cases with SLP (26%) and with CWMH (40%) than those without significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (8%), accounting for 10.6% of the total parkinsonian cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that parkinsonian cases with SLP or CWMH consist of not only cases with vascular-lesion-related VP but also IPD in which vascular lesions are not directly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absence of 4- to 6-Hz <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002396'>cogwheel rigidity</z:hpo> and the reduction in the SNpc width could be indicators for differentiating VP from IPD </plain></SENT>
