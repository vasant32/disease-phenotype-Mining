<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to seek development and progression of LA and associated risk factors in patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Presence and extent of LA were determined on entry and follow-up CT scans from 685 patients in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 596 patients without LA at entry, 107 (18.0%) developed restricted LA and 18 (3.0%) developed widespread LA during a mean follow-up of 6.1 years (range, 3.0 to 9.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Older age was associated significantly with LA development (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> had weak associations with LA development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 36.0% of patients who developed LA had 1 or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, particularly of the lacunar type, in comparison to 23.5% of patients who did not develop LA (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients who developed LA, the percentage with small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (diameter &lt; or =1.5 cm) increased from 34.4% on entry to 45.6% on follow-up CT scans compared with no increase (20.4% and 20.4%, respectively) in patients who did not develop LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 89 patients who had restricted LA at entry, 28 (31.5%) progressed to widespread LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression was associated with occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LA is common in elderly patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its development and progression are associated with higher occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, mainly of the lacunar type </plain></SENT>
