<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new unsupervised method has been developed, which is a multistage procedure, involving image preprocessing, calculation of tensor field and measurement of diffusion anisotropy, segmentation of infarction volume based on adaptive multiscale statistical classification (MSSC), and partial volume voxel reclassification (PVVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method accounts for random noise, intensity overlapping, partial volume effect (PVE), and intensity shading artifacts, which always appear in DT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proposed method was applied to 20 patients with clinically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by DT-MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accuracy and reproducibility in terms of identifying the infarction lesion have been confirmed by clinical experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This automatic segmentation method is promising not only in detecting the location and the size of infarction lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient but also in quantitatively analyzing diffusion anisotropy of lesion to guide clinical diagnoses and therapy </plain></SENT>
