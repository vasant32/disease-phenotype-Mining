<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-related diseases such as cerebrovascular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of VEGF -2578C&gt;A, -1154G&gt;A, -634G&gt;C, and 936C&gt;T polymorphisms on the susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA, VEGF polymorphisms were analyzed in 615 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 376 patients with silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and 494 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AA and CC+CA (C allele bearing) genotype frequencies of the -2578C&gt;A polymorphism and the CT+TT (T allele-bearing) genotype frequency of the 936C&gt;T polymorphism were significantly different between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and control groups (false discovery rate-adjusted probability values of 0.016, 0.044, and 0.044, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When stratified by the size of the occluded vessel, the VEGF polymorphisms were associated with patients with multiple small-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several haplotypes of the VEGF polymorphisms were significantly different between the control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With respect to silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, the difference in the frequency of the -634G&gt;C polymorphism between the GC+CC (C allele-bearing) genotype and the controls was marginally significant (false discovery rate-adjusted probability value of 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the -634G&gt;C and 936C&gt;T polymorphisms were associated with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels of patients with multiple or single small-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VEGF polymorphisms and haplotypes are possible genetic determinants for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, particularly in patients with multiple small-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, VEGF polymorphisms had only a weak association with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
