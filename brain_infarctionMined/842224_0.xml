<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose in 46 of the studied cases human albumin serum, labeled readioactive I131 was used and in 6 cases-Tc 99m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive scannograms were received only in 16 patients with infarctions in the system of the middle brain arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture in both groups of patients with positive and negative scannograms did not differ significantly from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This may indicate the fact that the process of accumulating radioactive isotopes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> depends upon manifold reasons: the state of collateral circulations, the traits of angioarchitectonics in the affected area, the level of metabolism in the focus of lesions, disturbed permeability of the menatoencephalic barrier, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In doubtful cases for the differential diagnosis between brain infactions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> the most valid criteria in scanning is the dynamics of the focus of accuumulation of radioactive isotopes </plain></SENT>
