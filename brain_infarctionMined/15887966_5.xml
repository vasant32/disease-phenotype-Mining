<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these derivatives, compounds 1 and 2 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against factor Xa (FXa) and good selectivity with respect to other serine proteases (thrombin, plasmin, and trypsin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, compound 2 exhibited potent anti-FXa activity after intravenous and oral administration to cynomolgus monkeys, showed a dose-dependent antithrombotic effect at 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and significantly reduced the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model at a dose of 0.1 mg kg(-1) h(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that compound 2 (JTV-803) is likely to be useful as both a venous and arterial antithrombotic agent </plain></SENT>
