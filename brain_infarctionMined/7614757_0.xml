<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present here an assumption that <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085084" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neuron disease</z:e> (MND) in part, because of very high incidence of HBV antibody in patients with MND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study HBV antibodies were determined in 34 patients with MND (15 with ALS, 7 with SPMA, 8 with PBP and 4 with PBP+SPMA), and it was revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen (enzyme immunoassay: EIA) was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antibody (HBs-Ab) (EIA) was positive in 25 patients (73.5%) (9 with ALS, 6 with SPMA, 7 with PBP and 3 with PBP+SPMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HBs-Ab was positive only in 2 out of 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (7.1%), and in 1 out of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002503'>spinocerebellar degeneration</z:hpo> (6.3%), both of which were used as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 22 patients with indefinite complaints, none was positive for HBs-Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the number of HBs-Ab positive individuals was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) greater in patients with MND than that in the patients having other disorders of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the above result, we conclude that MND may be partially ascribed to HBV </plain></SENT>
