<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An increase in intracranial pressure has been shown to threaten the outcome of patients with ischemic or traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its impact on the outcome of pigs undergoing hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> has been evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Fifty-six pigs underwent a 75-min period of hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> at 20 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure, cerebral microdialysis, hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were monitored throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were allowed to survive until the 7th postoperative day and, then, electively killed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 7-day survival rate was 60.7%, and among survivors, 20 of them (58.8%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in intracranial pressure as compared with the baseline level was observed since the end of cooling (p = 0.047) and the difference became larger during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the postoperative intervals (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals that died postoperatively tended to have higher intracranial pressure levels during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the postoperative intervals, but such a difference reached significance only at the 4-h postoperative interval (p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same tendency was observed among animals that survived until the 7th postoperative day and that developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or not, but the difference between these two groups did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The animals that died or developed postoperatively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> had higher intracranial pressure values postoperatively as compared with those that survived without developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and such a difference reached significance at the 2-h (p = 0.015) and 4-h postoperative intervals (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The peak intracranial pressure was 17.2 mmHg (IQR, 13.7-20.8) in animals that died or developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 14.1 mmHg (IQR, 11.8-16.4) in those that survived 7 days without developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracranial pressure increases</z:e> significantly after 75 min of experimental hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> and such an increase is associated with a high risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
