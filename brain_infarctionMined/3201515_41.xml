<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Water-suppressed image-guided localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in a 59-year-old woman with two major brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spectra were measured in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, in an area between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and in the healthy hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The volumes of interest were selected on the basis of a fast T2-weighted image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 1331-2662 Hahn spin-echo sequence was used to suppress the water in the 8-cm3 volume that was selected by means of spatially resolved spectroscopy or stimulated echoes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spectra were obtained in 5 minutes' accumulation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spectral editing was applied to separate the resonance of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> from that of other substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show no increase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after 6 months; however, a resonance was observed at 1.6 ppm, which is assigned to fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak intensities of brain-specific compounds were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical symptoms (at the time of bypass surgery), a fivefold increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values was observed in the area between the two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four months after bypass surgery, the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentration in this area had decreased to only twice <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We speculate that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> is a marker of reversible or impending brain damage </plain></SENT>
