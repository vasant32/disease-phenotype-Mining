<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was found preoperatively in three of the 16 hemispheres corresponding to symptomatic lesions (19%), in 18 of 109 hemispheres corresponding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (16.5%), and in one of four hemispheres corresponding to lesions responsible for a fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e> (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two surgical procedures (1.5%) were complicated by early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> as detected on postoperative computed tomographic scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These complications resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one case, and left the patient with major sequelae in the other </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was unchanged after 124 (94.6%) procedures, whereas four of these procedures were complicated by silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> as visualized on postoperative computed tomographic scans (3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that existing pre- and postoperative neurologic classifications are far from perfect and that surgery is rarely responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
