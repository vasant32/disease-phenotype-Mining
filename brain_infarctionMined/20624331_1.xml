<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This exceptional initial rightward bias is also seen in some right hemisphere (RH) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who do not meet the criteria of VN in conventional tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study compared RH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients' (examined on average 4 days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and healthy controls' starting points (SPs) in three cancellation tasks of the Behavioural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Inattention</z:e> Test (<z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, task-specific guideline values were defined for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SP to differentiate the performance of healthy subjects from that of patients with subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional tests indicated that 15 of the 70 RH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients had VN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group comprised 44 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each task, the VN group started the cancellations mainly from the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The non-neglect and healthy groups initiated most cancellations from the left, more so in the healthy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Starting more than one <z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi> task outside the guideline value indicated pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e>, as this was typical among the VN patients, but exceptional among the healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-third of the non-neglect patients showed pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">inattention</z:e> by starting more than one task outside the guideline value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical assessment of VN should, therefore, include an evaluation of the SPs to detect this subtle form of neglect </plain></SENT>
