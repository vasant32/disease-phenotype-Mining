<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Predicting motor recovery in the arm of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is generally based on clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, neurophysiologic measures may also have a predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the value of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in predicting motor recovery of the upper limb and to determine whether any of the SSEPs components can predict the severity of the deficit so that it can document the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (lacunar or large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 22 patients who had had a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and presented with obvious motor deficit of the arm were examined in terms of 3 clinical variables (motor performance, muscle tone, and overall disability) and for SSEPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical (Medical Research Council [MRC] scale and Barthel index scores) and neurophysiologic examinations were done at entry to the study (first week poststroke) and 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly low mean MRC scale score was found at first week versus after 3 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in patients with large-vessel as compared with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> both at first week and after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean Barthel index score was significantly higher after 3 months than at first week, whereas it was significantly lower in large-vessel as compared with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> both at first week and after 3 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly prolonged N(20) latency, low peak-to-peak amplitude (PPA), and low amplitude ratio were found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the neurophysiologic parameters were different in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between first week and third month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MRC score and PPA were correlated well with the outcome MRC and Barthel index scores after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>N(20) latency correlates with the outcome MRC score but not with the outcome Barthel index score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the N(20) latency was significantly different in lacunar from large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The muscle power (MRC score) is the main outcome predictor in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PPA is the main SSEPs component with high prognostic value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The SSEPs N(20) latency can predict (even roughly) the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (whether lacunar or large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
