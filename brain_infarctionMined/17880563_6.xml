<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the relationship between the C242T polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited 1055 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 1055 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A chi-squared test revealed that the T-allele frequency was lower in patients with cardioembolic infarction (5.6%) than in control subjects (11.0%, P &lt; 0.001); however, allele frequencies in patients with lacunar and atherothrombotic infarction (11.2%) were not significantly different from those in control subjects (11.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariate-adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis also revealed no association between CT + TT genotype, and lacunar and atherothrombotic infarction (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the functional effects of the C242T polymorphism, we examined <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production in COS-7 cells cotransfected with Nox4 and p22phox of each genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-producing activity in those cells expressing p22phox with the T allele was not significantly different from that in cells expressing p22phox with the C allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the p22phox C242T polymorphism may have a protective effect against cardioembolic infarction, but is not related to lacunar and atherothrombotic infarction in Japan </plain></SENT>
