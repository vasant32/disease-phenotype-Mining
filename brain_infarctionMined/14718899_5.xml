<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a sensitive method for demonstrating even small ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, clinical significance and course of ischemic lesions after CEA using serial DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DWI was performed within 1 day before and after CEA in 88 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative lesions were analyzed by their quantity, volume and distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To differentiate temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> from definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (blood brain barrier disruption) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a positive postoperative DWI were reexamined with contrast-enhanced T1-MRI 7-10 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by a neurologist within 2 days before and after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients showed a postoperative neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative DWI revealed ipsilateral ischemic lesions in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In seven of these patients a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was diagnosed on the T1-MRI during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between the number of DWI lesions (p=0.031) as well as the volume of DWI lesions (p=0.023) and definite infarction was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients preoperatively showed significantly more DWI lesions (p=0.036) and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DWI is a sensitive method of demonstrating ischemic events after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number and volume of DWI lesions after CEA are highly predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
