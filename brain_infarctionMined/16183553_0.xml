<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 52 year old male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brachiofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> and a hyperintense lesion with mass effect and ring-enhancement in basal ganglia suspiciously to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurosurgeons recommend stereotactical brain biopsy for diagnosis, but the patient recovered in following time gradually and in repeated computer tomographic images contrast enhancement disappeared and a hypodense zone in the basal ganglia remains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our case demonstrates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> can mimick <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> in taking cystic appearance and contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stereotactic biopsy would have been a precipitated invasive procedure in this case </plain></SENT>
