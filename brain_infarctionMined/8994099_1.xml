<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the surgery the rats were subjected to repeated behavioural tests during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen weeks after surgery the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and the slow-twitch soleus muscle of both sides were removed and examined with regard to muscle fibre characteristics obtained by histochemical and morphometrical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Limb placement and the ability to traverse a beam or a rotating pole were repeatedly tested 2-13 weeks after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of permanent sensorimotor deficits in limb placement and when traversing a rotating pole or beam, no increase in pathological changes was noted in either EDL or soleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number and proportion of fibre types remained unchanged in both muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in muscle fibre size in either EDL or soleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the rat, although causing marked impairment of contralateral motor function, does not have a major influence on the muscle-fibre <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> or fibre-type composition, irrespective of muscle type </plain></SENT>
