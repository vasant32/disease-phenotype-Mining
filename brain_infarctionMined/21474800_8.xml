<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cerebrovascular contribution to ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) has been scarcely explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we investigated the involvement of the blood-brain barrier and the role of its cellular components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven-minute occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, used as in vivo <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> stimulus 4 days before permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (8.45±0.7 versus 13.61±0.08 mm3 measured 7 days after injury) and preserved blood-brain barrier function (Evans blue leakage, 0.54±0.1 versus 0.89±0.1 ng/mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessment of neuronal, endothelial, and glial gene expression revealed that <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> specifically increased glial fibrillary acidic protein <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, thus showing selective astrocyte activation in <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>-protected mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blood-brain barrier was modeled by coculturing murine primary brain microvessel endothelial and astroglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-hour oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD), delivered 24 hours before a 5-hour OGD, acted as an <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> stimulus, significantly attenuating the reduction in transendothelial electric resistance (199.17±11.7 versus 97.72±3.4 Ωcm2) and the increase in permeability coefficients for <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> (0.98±0.11×10(-3) versus 1.8±0.36×10(-3) cm/min) and albumin (0.12±0.01×10(-3) versus 0.29±0.07×10(-3) cm/min) induced by severe OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> also prevented the 5-hour OGD-induced disorganization of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> on glial (but not endothelial) cells alone preserved transendothelial electric resistance, permeability coefficients, and ZO-1 localization after 5 hours of OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte metabolic inhibition by fluorocitrate abolished <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> protection, confirming the critical role of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> significantly increased glial fibrillary acidic protein, interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor-a, and ciliary neurotrophic factor gene expression after OGD in glial cells, indicating that multiple pathways mediate the glial contribution to <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the blood-brain barrier can be directly preconditioned and that astrocytes are major mediators of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> protection </plain></SENT>
