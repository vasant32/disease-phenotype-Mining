<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective (10-13 years) cohort trial of prognostic significance of subclinical forms of cerebral pathology in EH in relation to ADCC development covered 111 men aged 45-55 years who had undergone a unified neurological and cardiological examination in 1992-1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Such factors as disordered circulation along major arteries of the head (a relative risk 3.1 [1.2; 10.3]), thick intima-media complex of the common carotid artery (a relative risk: 5.2 [2.1; 14.3]), the presence of asymptomatic lacunar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (a relative risk: 6.6 [2.3; 13.5]) were revealed to be of unfavourable prognostic significance in respect to development of ADCC in EH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Some subclinical risk factors may have prognostic value in relation to development of ADCC in EH </plain></SENT>
