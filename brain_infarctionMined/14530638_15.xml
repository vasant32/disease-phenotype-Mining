<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to determine whether the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm and the overall clinical outcome differ between patients treated with surgical clipping compared with endovascular obliteration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, 98 patients with aneurysmal SAH were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients underwent surgery and clipping and 26 had coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, permanent neurologic deficit due to vasospasm and clinical outcome were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with better clinical and radiological grades (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades I-III and Fisher grades I-III) were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 22% of the patients; 25% in the surgical group and 15% in the endovascular group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine percent of the patients in the surgical group and 7% in the endovascular group suffered ischemic infarction with permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients with better clinical and radiological grades, no significant difference was found for the rate of symptomatic vasospasm; 23% in the surgical and 12% in the endovascular group (p = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall clinical outcome was comparable in both groups, with no difference in the likelihood of a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 3 or less (15% in the surgical and 16% in the endovascular group; p = 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same results for outcome were obtained for the subgroup of patients with better clinical grades on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic vasospasm and ischemic infarction rate seem comparable in both groups, even for patients with better clinical and radiological admission grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is no significant difference in the overall clinical outcome at the long-term follow-up between both groups </plain></SENT>
