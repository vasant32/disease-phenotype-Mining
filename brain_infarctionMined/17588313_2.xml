<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of microplasmin on behavioral performance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some experiments support that microplasmin may have neuroprotective and thrombolytic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty rats underwent surgery and were embolized in the right carotid territory with a fibrin-rich <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and randomly assigned into three groups: 5 mg/kg microplasmin, 10 mg/kg microplasmin or saline (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups treated with microplasmin received 50% bolus injection 10 minutes after embolization and 50% continuous infusion during the following hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were trained to obtain high baseline scores in Montoya's staircase test before embolization and were retested during 7-14 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When pre-maturely dead animals were excluded, no differences were observed among groups regarding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mortality was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (p&lt;0.05) and when performances were evaluated 7-14 days after surgery, Group 1 was significantly better than Group 2 concerning fine motor performance (p&lt;0.05) and also achieved more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bodyweight (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Among surviving animals, 5 mg/kg microplasmin treatment had no effect compared to saline-treated control animals; 5 mg/kg microplasmin reduced mortality and improved both behavioral rehabilitation and bodyweight compared to 10 mg/kg microplasmin treatment, while saline-treated animals did not differ from animals treated with 10 mg/kg microplasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results indicate a potential beneficial effect of 5 mg/kg microplasmin treatment, while 10 mg/kg may worsen outcomes </plain></SENT>
