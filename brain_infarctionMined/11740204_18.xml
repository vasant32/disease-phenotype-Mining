<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors previously reported that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1 alpha), a member of the CC chemokines, was expressed in glial cells after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the function of chemokines in the ischemic brain remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> macrophage inflammatory protein-II (vMIP-II), a chemokine analogue encoded by human herpesvirus-8 DNA, has been demonstrated to have antagonistic activity at several chemokine receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of vMIP-II and MIP-1alpha on ischemic brain injury were examined in mice to elucidate the roles of chemokines endogenously produced in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracerebroventricular injection of vMIP-II (0.01-1 microg) reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a dose-dependent manner when examined 48 hours after 1-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 1 microg MIP-1alpha increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the cortical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results supported the possibility that chemokines endogenously produced in the brain are involved in ischemic injury, and that chemokine receptors are potential targets for therapeutic intervention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
