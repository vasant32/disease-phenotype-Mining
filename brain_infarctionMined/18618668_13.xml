<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) reduce the thickness of glial scar wall and facilitate axonal remodeling in the ischemic boundary zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further clarify the role of BMSCs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> and its underlying mechanism, the current study focused on the effect of BMSCs on neurocan expression in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by an injection of 3 x 10(6) rat BMSCs (n = 16) or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 15) into the tail vein 24 h later </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining analysis showed that reactive astrocytes were the primary source of neurocan, and BMSC-treated animals had significantly lower neurocan and higher growth associated protein 43 expression in the penumbral region compared with control rats, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the effects of BMSCs on astrocyte neurocan expression, single reactive astrocytes were collected from the ischemic boundary zone using laser capture microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurocan gene expression was significantly down-regulated in rats receiving BMSC transplantation (n = 4/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary cultured astrocytes showed similar alterations; BMSC coculture during reoxygenation abolished the up-regulation of neurocan gene in astrocytes undergoing oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (n = 3/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that BMSCs promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0003450'>axonal regeneration</z:hpo> by reducing neurocan expression in peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> astrocytes </plain></SENT>
