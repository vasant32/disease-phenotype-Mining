<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence now exists for a pathogenic role for neutrophils in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the patterns and temporal profile of cerebral neutrophil recruitment to areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) and have attempted to correlate this with neurological status and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with cortical middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) IS were recruited within 24 hours of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recruitment was studied using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111 (111In) troponolate-labeled neutrophils, planar imaging, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was calculated from concurrent computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin sections were obtained postmortem (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was measured using Barthel, Rankin, and National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NIHSS) scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant 111In-neutrophil recruitment to ipsilateral hemisphere, as measured by asymmetry index (AI), was demonstrated within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 9 patients; this response was heterogenous between patients and on repeated measurement attenuated over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologically, recruitment was confirmed within intravascular, intramural, and intraparenchymal compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interindividual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in neutrophil response did not correlate with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In an exploratory analysis, neutrophil accumulation appeared to correlate significantly with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> expansion (Spearman rho=0.66; P=0.03, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils recruit to areas of ischemic brain within 24 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This recruitment attenuates over time and is confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While neutrophil accumulation may be associated with either the magnitude or the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth, these results require confirmation in future studies </plain></SENT>
