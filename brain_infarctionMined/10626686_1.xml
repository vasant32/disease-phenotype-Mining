<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lysosomes were observed in the expanded cytoplasm of the endothelial cells, which were vacuolated by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for CD31, one of the vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, was minimal to faint in endothelial cells with vacuolations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The loss of CD31 immunoreactivity and breakdown of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in vacuolated endothelial cells seem to promote the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, diffuse and various degrees of axonal damage, most likely caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorder</z:e> in cerebral or cerebellar white matter, was reported using the amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunohistochemical method </plain></SENT>
