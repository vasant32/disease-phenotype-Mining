<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> are commonly observed on brain CTs of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, their prognostic importance is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The association between appropriately sited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (ie, lesions located in the anterior circulation of the brain and ipsilateral to the symptomatic stenosed carotid artery) visualized on CT and the risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression in 164 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (and no history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and severe angiographically defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (70 to 99%) from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and CT-verified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> were older and were more likely to have higher degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and carotid plaque ulceration, a longer duration of symptoms, and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With regard to prognosis, after adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known risk factors (patient characteristics) in a regression analysis, the presence of ischemic lesions observed on CT was not associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 2 years (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.39 to 2.58; p value = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considered in combination with other patient characteristics, the mere presence of an appropriately sited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on CT does not alter the prognosis (risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) of severely stenosed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is no clinical rationale in differentiating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> on the basis of CT findings alone </plain></SENT>
