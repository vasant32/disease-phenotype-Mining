<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial electrode monitoring is still required in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery; however, it is associated with significant morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with complications during invasive intracranial EEG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing invasive monitoring at Westmead between 1988-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From detailed chart reviews, the following variables were recorded: duration of intracranial monitoring, the site of grid implantation, number of grids and electrodes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, postoperative complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (median age: 24 years) underwent subdural electrode implantation; 62% had extratemporal lobe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and 46% were non-lesional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 58 monitored patients who had cortical resections, 45 had good <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications related to subdural electrode implantation included transient complications requiring no treatment (12.7%), transient complications requiring treatment (9.9%) and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (2.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific complications included subdural haemorrhage, transient neurological deficit, infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred within 48 h of implantation were related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (one venous infarction, one unexplained) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were associated with maximal size of grid (p &lt; 0.001), greater number of electrodes (p &lt; 0.001), electrode density per cortical surface implanted (p &lt; 0.001), right central surface implantation (p = 0.003) and left central surface implantation (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression identified larger size grids and right central surface implantation as independent predictors of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are significant complications during intracranial EEG evaluations but the majority of these are transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found a relationship between the size of the electrode arrays and the incidence of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results of this study have been used to modify our implantation and monitoring protocols </plain></SENT>
