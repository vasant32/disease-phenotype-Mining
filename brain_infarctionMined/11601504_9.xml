<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative neuronal recording revealed that mean firing rates were low, and that firing was irregular in the globus pallidus compared with off-state parkinsonian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> with striatal infarction is driven by phasic neuronal activity with a low firing rate in the globus pallidus and that the neural pathway of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> has a functional somatotopical organization in the globus pallidus </plain></SENT>
