<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there is evidence that rt-PA can mediate neuronal damage after ischemic brain injury in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to other mechanisms, enhancement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor signalling has been proposed to underlie rt-PA-mediated neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the role of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation, which mediates postischemic excitotoxic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, in rt-PA-mediated aggravation of ischemic brain injury has not been established and was therefore addressed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, intravenous rt-PA application significantly increased early postischemic PARP-1 activation within ischemic hemispheres and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes compared with control mice without affecting cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rt-PA induced increase in PARP-1 activation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes could be blocked by the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the rt-PA-induced increase in PARP-1 activation was also prevented by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, we demonstrate that rt-PA treatment enhances postischemic PARP-1 activation, which contributes to rt-PA induced aggravation of ischemic brain injury in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we provide evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation is required for rt-PA-mediated effects on postischemic PARP-1 activation </plain></SENT>
