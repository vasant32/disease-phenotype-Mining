<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The total rupture of the autoregulatory mechanisms of the brain blood flow was discovered, leading to the development of different phenomena of "brain steal" determining the clinical course of stem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the given pathology, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period is characterized by the development of the vicious circle of hemodynamic disorders, which is coupled with pathological dissociation in coagulation hemostasis </plain></SENT>
