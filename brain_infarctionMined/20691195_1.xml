<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neuregulins are a family of growth factors essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac and <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EGF-like domain of neuregulins contains the active site which binds and activates signaling cascades through ErbB receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A neuregulin-1 gene EGF-like fragment demonstrated neuroprotection in the transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model and drastically reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (Xu et al., 2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we use a permanent MCAO rat model to initially compare two products of the neuregulin-1 gene and also assess levels of recovery with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> versus delayed time to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the initial study full-length glial growth factor 2 (GGF2) and an EGF-like domain fragment were compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intravenous delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a second study GGF2 only was delivered starting at 24h, 3 days or 7 days after permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both studies daily intravenous administration continued for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recovery of neurological function was assessed using limb placing and body swing tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GGF2 had similar functional improvements compared to the EGF-like domain fragment at equimolar doses, and a higher dose of GGF2 demonstrated more robust functional improvements compared to a lower dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GGF2 improved sensorimotor recovery with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment paradigms, even enhancing recovery of function with a delay of 7 days to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histological assessments did not show any associated reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at either 48 h or 21 days post-ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurorestorative effects of this kind are of great potential clinical importance, given the difficulty of delivering neuroprotective therapies within a short time after an ischemic event in human patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If confirmed by additional work including additional data on mechanism(s) of improved outcome with verification in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models, one can make a compelling case to bring GGF2 to clinical trials as a neurorestorative approach to improving outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
