<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, functional testing is essential in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies to increase the predictive value of animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used several sensory and motor tests to assess functional disability in a mouse model of permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pdMCAO) that induced mainly cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gait dynamics were transiently disturbed after pdMCAO as measured by different analysis techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stance and brake duration were shorter after pdMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with sensory and motor deficits the latency to move was prolonged up to 14 days after pdMCAO and the performance in the corner test and handedness were affected on day 1 or 2 after pdMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate was decreased and heart rate variability were increased after pdMCAO indicating sympathetic-parasympathetic imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, pdMCAO-induced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> lead to clinically relevant sensory, motor and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study provides a basis to explore the potential of functional testing for neuroprotection and neuroregeneration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
