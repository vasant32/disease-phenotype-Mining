<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine possible protective effects of FGF-2 gene expression against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats, a replication defective, recombinant adenovirus vector expressing FGF-2, was injected intraventricularly 2 hours after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment group showed significant recovery compared with the vehicle-treated groups in terms of serial neurologic severity scores over the 35 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining showed that FGF-2 gene transfer decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 44% as compared with that in the vehicle-treated groups at 2 days after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same tendency of gene transfer effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was confirmed at 35 days after MCAO with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>/eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that FGF-2 concentration was increased significantly at 2 days after MCAO, not only in cerebrospinal fluid but also in cerebral substance in the lesioned and treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that FGF-2 gene transfer using these adenoviral vectors might be a useful modality for the treatment of occlusive cerebrovascular disease even after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
