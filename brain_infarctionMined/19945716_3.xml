<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, at present, no neuroprotective agent has proven effective in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> phase III trials, despite the encouraging data in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to explore the effect of the brain penetrant low molecular weight radical scavenger bis(1-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)-decandioate (IAC) in neurological damage subsequent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in Mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the intraperitoneal effects of IAC on temporary bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCO) by means of morphological and histological analysis of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant dose-dependent protective effects of IAC (1 to 10mg/kg b.w.) against neuropathological and morphological brain changes were seen when administered i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1h before temporary BCCO in Mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When administered up to 6h after BCCO, IAC actually reverses the neurodegenerative processes (e.g. hippocampal cell viability) induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data show that IAC is highly effective in protecting and preventing oxidative brain damage associated with cerebral flow disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is also effective even in late treatment of the insult, emphasizing its potential role for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
