<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of vertebrobasilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (VAD) is not fully known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to review the clinical outcome of the patients with VAD, then to propose an appropriate management strategy for VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From 1992 to 2004, 35 VAD patients admitted to our institutes were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 28 men and 7 women, whose age ranged from 4 to 67 years with a mean age of 44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was assessed to document the shape, and location of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with respect to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A modified Rankin score was assigned for functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome scores were analyzed according to the patient's age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> history, the pattern of initial manifestation, angiographic shape of VAD, angiographic location of VAD, treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: There was no statistically significant difference between the functional outcome with age, gender, trauma history and past medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 35 patients, 22 presented with SAH, 11 with ischemic symptoms and 2 were incidentally detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients without SAH had a better functional outcome than those with SAH (p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was statistical significance between Hunt-Hess (H-H) grade and clinical outcome (p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The shape and location of VAD was not significantly related to the functional outcome (p = 0.294, 0.840) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases of rebleeding and mortality (except one case with initially poor H-H grade) developed exclusively in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant correlation between the treatment modality and the outcome (p = 0.691) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The VAD patients with SAH would be recommended to be managed by either surgical or endovascular treatment, but those without SAH, could be managed conservatively with antiplatelet therapy and/or anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
