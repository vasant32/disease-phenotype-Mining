<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As intracellular Zn(2+) liberation mediates neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways, we tested whether a sub-lethal increase in free Zn(2+) could also trigger neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuronal free Zn(2+) transiently increased following preconditioning, and was both necessary and sufficient for conferring excitotoxic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lethal exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> led to a delayed increase in Zn(2+) that contributed significantly to excitotoxicity in non-preconditioned neurons, but not in tolerant neurons, unless preconditioning-induced free Zn(2+) was chelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, preconditioning may trigger the expression of Zn(2+)-regulating processes, which, in turn, prevent subsequent Zn(2+)-mediated toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, preconditioning increased Zn(2+)-regulated gene expression in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination of the molecular signaling mechanism leading to this early Zn(2+) signal revealed a critical role for protein kinase C (PKC) activity, suggesting that PKC may act directly on the intracellular source of Zn(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified a conserved PKC phosphorylation site at serine-32 (S32) of metallothionein (MT) that was important in modulating Zn(2+)-regulated gene expression and conferring excitotoxic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we observed increased PKC-induced serine phosphorylation in immunopurified MT1, but not in mutant MT1(S32A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that neuronal Zn(2+) serves as an important, highly regulated signaling component responsible for the initiation of a neuroprotective pathway </plain></SENT>
