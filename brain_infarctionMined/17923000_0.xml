<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the modified Scheltens scale, the magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) changes of lesion distribution, size and shape in 7 patients from a CADASIL family were retrospectively analyzed during 3 years observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 6 of 7 patients, the number and volume of lesion areas in the white matter were increased (parietal lobe, n = 6; temporal lobe, n = 5; frontal lobe, n = 3; occipital lobe, n = 2) and some areas even became confluent as a mass or chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n = 1 - 5) appeared in 5 patients and the arcuate fiber were involved in 1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Slight enlargement could be seen in lateral ventricle (n = 1) or lateral ventricle with third ventricle (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging can help us to reveal dynamic changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> and prognosis in patients with CADASIL </plain></SENT>
