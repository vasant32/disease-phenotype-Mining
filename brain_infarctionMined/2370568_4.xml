<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> did not differ from that in primary intracerebral haemorrhage (odds ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.32-5.1) (P = 1.0), whereas it was significantly higher in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio: 5.57; 95% confidence interval 2.00-15.4) (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, as in primary intracerebral haemorrhage, is unlikely to be the cause of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas perhaps 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are not caused by non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> when present </plain></SENT>
