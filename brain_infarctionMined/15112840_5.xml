<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Central <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> has been linked historically to bihemispheric involvement of the temporal lobe, with more recent findings suggesting that compromise of other cortical and subcortical structures can also result in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present investigation extends our understanding of the potential anatomical correlates to central <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> by demonstrating that bilateral involvement of an auditory structure within the midbrain can additionally result in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our subject was a 21-year-old male with a subarachnoid bleed affecting both inferior colliculi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant auditory deficits were noted for the middle and late auditory evoked potentials, while electrophysiologic measures of the periphery indicated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was enrolled in a rehabilitation program for approximately 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although initially unresponsive to sounds, the patient regained most of his auditory abilities during the 10 months he was followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case documents the range of auditory deficits that may be associated with damage to the inferior colliculi, and it profiles a hierarchical recovery of auditory function consistent with test findings </plain></SENT>
