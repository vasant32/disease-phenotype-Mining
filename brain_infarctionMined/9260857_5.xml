<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a right-to-left intracardiac shunt, demonstrated by echocardiography and transcranial Doppler sonography has been shown to be higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of contrast transcranial Doppler sonography in comparison to transesophageal echocardiography in the detection and differentiation of intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunts and to correlate the transcranial Doppler findings with clinical outcome and morphological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty five consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> were entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 patients with middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of the left (56%) or right (44%) territory and echocardiographic demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (80%) or intrapulmonary shunt (20%), simultaneous bilateral transcranial Doppler sonography of the middle cerebral arteries was performed after contrast medium injection during rest and valsalva straining under standardized and optimized conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall sensitivity for the detection of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> by contrast transcranial Doppler sonography was 97% and overall specificity was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral appearance of microbubbles, microbubble count and time delay of microbubble appearance significantly increased after valsalva straining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with intracardiac shunts, a significantly higher microbubble count (32 vs. 13 in patients with an intrapulmonary shunt) and a shorter time interval of microbubble appearance (11 vs. 14 s in patients with intrapulmonary shunts) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the side and numerical distribution of microbubble count and the location and severity of the current clinical symptoms, as well as between microbubble count and presence and hemispherical distribution of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler sonography is a highly sensitive method for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo>, whether of cardiac or pulmonary location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However. no correlation was found between the side and number of microbubbles counted and the clinical symptomatology </plain></SENT>
