<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We addressed whether dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is affected in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory (MCAS) and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (LS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood pressure (MAP) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity (V) were measured in 10 patients with large MCAS (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> score, 17+/-2; mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), in 10 with LS (score, 9+/-1), and in 10 reference subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>dCA was evaluated in time (delay of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> Vmean counter-regulation during changes in MAP) and frequency domains (cross-spectral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> Vmean-to-MAP phase lead) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In reference subjects, latencies for MAP increments (5.3+/-0.5 seconds) and decrements (5.6+/-0.5 seconds) were comparable, and low frequency <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> Vmean-to-MAP phase lead was 56+/-5 and 59+/-5 degrees (left and right hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In MCAS, these latencies were 4.6+/-0.7 and 5.6+/-0.5 seconds in the nonischemic hemisphere and not detectable in the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the unaffected hemisphere, phase lead was 61+/-6 degrees versus 26+/-6 degrees on the ischemic side (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In LS, no latency and smaller phase lead bilaterally (32+/-6 and 33+/-5 degrees) conformed to globally impaired dCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In large MCAS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, dynamic cerebral autoregulation was impaired in the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In LS, dynamic cerebral autoregulation was impaired bilaterally, a finding consistent with the hypothesis of bilateral small vessel disease in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
