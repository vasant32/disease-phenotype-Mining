<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>-clumsy hand syndrome (DCHS) is a well known and infrequent lacunar syndrome, there are few data regarding the spectrum of associated clinical characteristics, anatomical site of lesion, and aetiopathogenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a clinical description of this subtype of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on data collected from a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2500 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients included in a hospital based prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry over a 12-year period, 35 patients were identified as having DCHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DCHS accounted for 1.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (35/2110), 1.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (35/1840), and 6.1% of lacunar syndromes (35/570) admitted consecutively to a neurology department and included in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry over this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results supported the lacunar hypothesis in 94.3% of patients (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atherothrombotic and cardioembolic infarction occurred in only one patient each (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient with DCHS had an intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome was good (mortality in hospital 0%, symptom free at discharge 45.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, absence of limitation at discharge, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> but not cerebellar-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, and internal capsule (40%), pons (17%), and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata (8.6%) location were significantly associated with DCHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DCHS is a rare cerebrovascular syndrome, and supports the criteria of the lacunar hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients in this study had internal capsule <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognosis is good with striking similarity compared with other types of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There are important differences between DCHS and non-lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Internal capsule and pons are the most frequent cerebral sites </plain></SENT>
