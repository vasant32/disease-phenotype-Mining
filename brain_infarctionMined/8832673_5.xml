<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The success of thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> relies on timely reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study examines the efficacy of antiplatelet agents as adjuvants for thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using an established rabbit model of clot embolization and a randomized blinded design, rabbits (n = 8 in each group) were orally pretreated daily for 5 days with adjuvant aspirin (1 mg/kg of body weight or 20 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg), or vehicle (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="29377">sodium carbonate</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the 6th day, tissue plasminogen activator (6.3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 2 h), was initiated 1 hour after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was reduced to &lt; 10 ml/100 g/min immediately after clot embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the initiation of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), there was significant restoration of CBF in the control (t-PA only) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> groups (P &lt; 0.05) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restoration of CBF generally correlated with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (percent hemisphere, mean +/- standard error of the mean), which was 18.0 +/- 7.0 in the t-PA only group versus 11.0 +/- 3.3, 26.5 +/- 5.8, and 21.5 +/- 3.4 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, low-dose aspirin, and high-dose aspirin groups, respectively (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> versus aspirin, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clot lysis was identical in the control and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> groups, with 6 of 8 animals demonstrating complete clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspirin antagonized clot lysis in a dose-related manner, with low-and high-dose aspirin groups noting clot lysis in four of eight and two of eight animals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size when compared with aspirin treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> treatment did not affect clot lysis or CBF relative to t-PA alone, aspirin therapy resulted in antagonism of clot lysis and was associated with a more modest restoration of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study provides a background for a more comprehensive understanding of the balance of thrombogenicity and thrombolysis and may assist in the development of novel therapies to expedite cerebrovascular patency and reduce ischemic and reperfusion-mediated neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
