<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the population-based Cardiovascular Health Study, 3,660 participants age &gt; or =65 underwent an MRI scan in 1992-1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five years later, 2,313 were scanned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiologists assessed MRI scans in a standardized and blinded manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Food frequency questionnaires were used to assess dietary intakes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants with known cerebrovascular disease were excluded from the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for multiple risk factors, the risk of having one or more prevalent subclinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was lower among those consuming tuna/other fish &gt; or =3 times/week, compared to &lt;1/month (relative risk 0.74, 95% CI = 0.54-1.01, p = 0.06, p trend = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tuna/other fish consumption was also associated with trends toward lower incidence of subclinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, tuna/other fish intake was associated with better white matter grade, but not with sulcal and ventricular grades, markers of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between fried fish consumption and any subclinical brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, modest consumption of tuna/other fish, but not fried fish, was associated with lower prevalence of subclinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> on MRI examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results add to prior evidence that suggest that dietary intake of fish with higher eicosapentaenoic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> content, and not fried fish intake, may have clinically important health benefits </plain></SENT>
