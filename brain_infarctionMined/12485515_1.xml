<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the delay in time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to arrival at the emergency department (ED) and to evaluate the factors associated with the delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, the factors influencing the delay in time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to patients arrival at the ED and ED-CT and access to ED-treatment were explored in 623 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data recorded included patients' knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to ED was 5.17 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analysis showed that significant risk factors related to arrival delay included living alone at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the illness, no facility of ambulance transportation, presence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, mild degree of neurological symptoms, long distance from home to hospital, not seeking seeking any help within the first hour, less attention to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time from arrival at the ED to arrival at the CT scan was 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>75.8% patients finished CT scan within 30 minutes and 78.2% were treated within one hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is significant time delay from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to patients arrival at the ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further health education is necessary to increase the public awareness of seeking medical help after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and having ambulance transportation to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-care hospital </plain></SENT>
