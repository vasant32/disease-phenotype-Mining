<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most instances, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (HE) stainings are accepted for this purpose, but neither is perfect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a comparative study of the TTC immersion method and HE staining for quantification of early brain ischemic injury in cats, focussing on the reproducibility associated with planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> was produced by middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion via the transorbital approach in 14 cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 6 h of occlusion, two slices of 3 mm thickness, passing through the optic chiasma and mammillary body, were selected for pathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TTC immersion and HE staining were both used for planimetric study of the surface of the same slice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area of the injury was traced manually with the aid of computerized digital planimetry and expressed as a percentage of the area of the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area of hemispheric injury and the area of gray matter injury were separately calculated in the TTC specimens, and each was compared with the area of gray matter injury in the HE-stained specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements were repeated twice on each slice to estimate errors associated with manual tracing of the boundary of the area of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage values of the area of injury in the TTC-immersed gray matter specimens were lower than those detected by HE staining, although there was a very significant correlation between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The differences between each two measurements of TTC-determined gray matter injury were significantly less than those between each two measurements of HE-determined gray matter injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The differences between each two measurements of TTC-determined hemispheric injury were slightly less than those between each two measurements of TTC-determined gray matter injury, although there was no significant difference between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For quantifying ischemic injury after 6 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in cats, the TTC immersion method is more reproducible and simpler in manner than HE staining, but the results of both are significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
