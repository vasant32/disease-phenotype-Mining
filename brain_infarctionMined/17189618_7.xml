<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such situations, a scaffold is necessary for the implanted or migrated cells to produce new tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this present study, therefore, we attempted to restore brain tissue using a novel biomaterial, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31498,48137">polydimethylsiloxane</z:chebi>-tetraethoxysilane (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="31498">PDMS</z:chebi>-TEOS) hybrid with or without vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is crucial for new vessel formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31498">PDMS</z:chebi>-TEOS scaffold was implanted into the artificial brain defect, it remained at the implanted site and kept the integrity of the brain shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 30 days after the implantation, the marginal territory of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31498">PDMS</z:chebi>-TEOS scaffold became occupied by newly formed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the new tissue was constituted by astrocytes and endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of VEGF increased the newly produced tissue volume, and the immunohistochemical analysis showed that the numbers of astrocytes and endothelial cells were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double staining with proliferation maker Ki67 demonstrated that VEGF significantly increased newly formed astrocytes and endothelial cells, indicating that addition of VEGF accelerated tissue restoration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings show that implantation of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31498">PDMS</z:chebi>-TEOS scaffold with VEGF might be effective for treating old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or trauma </plain></SENT>
