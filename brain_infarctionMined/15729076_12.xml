<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the SMA is difficult to diagnose and mortality remains high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Malmo, Sweden, the autopsy rate between 1970 and 1982 was 87%, creating possibilities for a population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 23,496 clinical autopsies and 7569 forensic autopsies, 213 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboembolic occlusion of the SMA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal infarction</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A clinical suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal infarction</z:e> was documented in 32% of the patients, only 35% being in the care of surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> ratio was 1.4 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic occlusions were located more proximally than embolic occlusions (P &lt; 0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal infarction</z:e> was more extensive (P = 0.025) and thrombotic occlusions were associated with old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (P = 0.048), aortic wall <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P = 0.080), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346957" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">disseminated cancer</z:e> (P = 0.079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with embolic occlusions (n = 122) had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) than patients with thrombotic occlusions (P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The embolic source was identified in 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 115 (94%), synchronous embolism and/or source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were findings of remaining cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in 58 (48%) and synchronous emboli affected 273 other arterial segments in 83 (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and revascularization would have been a prerequisite for survival in at least half of the patients, since the jejunum, ileum, and colon were affected by infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A minority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were under surgical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, and synchronous emboli were common findings among patients with embolic occlusions </plain></SENT>
