<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Epidemiological evidence suggests that heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, whereas light-to-moderate alcohol intake decreases the risk, but the role of different drinking patterns has remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated recent light, moderate, and heavy alcohol drinking and former <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e> as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by etiological subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared 212 consecutive patients aged between 16 and 60 years, who were completely evaluated for the etiology of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, with 274 control subjects admitted to the emergency unit of the same hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ORs, as estimates of multivariate relative risks (RRs), and 95% CIs after adjustment for possible confounding variables were calculated by logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ORs were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>hyperlipemia</z:mp>, current smoking, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e> but not former <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy drinking</z:e> was an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consumption of 151 to 300 g and &gt;300 g alcohol within the week preceding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly increased the risk for cardioembolic and cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consumption of &gt;40 g alcohol within the preceding 24 hours increased the risk for cardiogenic embolism to the brain among those who had a high-risk source (RR 4.75, 95% CI 1.23 to 18.4), the risk for tandem embolism among those who had prominent large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (RR 7.68, 95% CI 1.82 to 32.3), and the risk for cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (RR 3.84, 95% CI 1.69 to 8.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Light drinking did not increase the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> drinking of intoxicating amounts of alcohol may trigger the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among subjects who have a source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the heart or the large arteries </plain></SENT>
