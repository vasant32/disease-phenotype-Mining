<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging techniques such as magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy are promising diagnostic tools for use with patients with diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e> such as neuropsychiatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (NPSLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such patients are often on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> (CS) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presently, it is unknown whether CSs per se influence quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of low-dose oral CSs on MTI, DWI, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy parameters of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients with and without CS medication and 15 healthy controls were subjected to conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, whole-brain MTI and DWI, and single-voxel <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral CSs were used by 13 of the RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses with age as a covariate were performed on MTI, DWI, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy parameters between RA patients with and without CSs and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlations were calculated between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imaging parameters and duration of disease, duration of CS use, and CS dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups of subjects or significant correlations with clinical parameters were found for MTI, DWI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, we found no evidence for an effect of low-dose oral CSs on whole-brain MTI and DWI histogram parameters and single-voxel <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy measurements of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrate that it is unlikely that MTI, DWI, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy parameters reported in NPSLE studies are confounded by low-dose oral CS </plain></SENT>
