<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The frequency of invasive fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> (IFS) has increased in recent years with the use of steroids, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33282">antibacterial agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on the clinical features and outcomes of four patients with IFS involving the cavernous sinus and orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors facilitating an early diagnosis are described, and the usefulness of combination therapy involving systemic administration of antifungal agents and surgical intervention is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We treated four patients with IFS between March 2003 and November 2007 at Ehime University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were two males and two females, aged from 61 to 74 years (mean 67.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With regard to clinical symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve paralysis</z:hpo> (visual disturbance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, cheek <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo>) was seen in 3 patients. Î²-D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37163">Glucan</z:chebi> levels in four patients were high compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspergillus was histopathologically identified from biopsy specimens in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was complicated with Candida in addition to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aspergillus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Orbital exenteration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e> were performed in 2 patients as surgical debridement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, systemic administration of antifungal agents was initiated after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received strategic treatment with surgery and systemic administration of anti-fungal agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The single fatality was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> caused by the spread of Aspergillus, and the remaining three patients are still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our observations in these patients suggest that early diagnosis and strategic treatment may improve the prognosis of IFS </plain></SENT>
