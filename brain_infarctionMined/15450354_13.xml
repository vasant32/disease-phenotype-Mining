<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cystatin C is a strong endogenous inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases, such as cathepsin B, L, H and S, that are involved in various biological processes such as degradation of cellular proteins and regulation of enzymes, as well as in pathological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of cathepsins has been shown to reduce neuronal damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, suggesting that cystatin C is an endogenous neuroprotectant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cystatin C has also amyloidogenic properties and is co-localized with beta-amyloid in degenerated neurons in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, suggesting a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that endogenous cystatin C is neuroprotective during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, global and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> was induced in mice with the cystatin C gene knocked out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, larger brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in cystatin C knockout mice, probably due to a reduced inhibition of the cathepsins during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, brain damage after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was diminished in cystatin C knockout mice, suggesting that cystatin C has an aggravating effect on selective neuronal damage after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
