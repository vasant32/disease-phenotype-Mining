<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To clarify the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of small vessel disease of the brain, we investigated the association between common variation in the C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 genes, plasma CRP and IL6 levels, and presence of MRI-defined white matter lesions (WML) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (BI) in elderly participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP and IL6 genes were selected from the SeattleSNPs database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cross-sectional analyses, logistic regression models adjusting for known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors were constructed to assess the associations of plasma CRP and IL6 levels and common CRP and IL6 gene haplotypes with presence of WML or BI in Blacks (n=532) and Whites (n=2905) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma IL6 and CRP levels were associated with presence of WML and BI in both races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Whites, common haplotypes of the IL6 gene were significantly associated with WML and BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The common haplotype tagged by the -174G/C promoter polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of WML (OR=1.14; 95% CI: [1.02; 1.28]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The common haplotype tagged by the -572G/C promoter polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of BI (OR=1.57; 95% CI: [1.15; 2.14]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant associations were lacking for WML or BI with IL6 gene variation in Blacks, or with CRP gene variation in either race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of a genetic basis underlying the relationship between plasma biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and small vessel disease of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies to elucidate the specific role of IL6 in disease pathogenesis are warranted </plain></SENT>
