<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, White people often present with large-vessel and Black people with small-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the relation between large- and small-vessel disease, and ethnicity in White, Black, and Asian patients in Amsterdam, The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a hospital-based population of 668 patients ethnicity was determined by self-identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relation between ethnicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, as an indicator of large-vessel disease, was determined using univariate analysis, and adjusted for age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently the relation between ethnicity and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, as a manifestation of small-vessel disease, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The odds ratio for having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, compared to White patients, was 0.55 (0.23-1.33) for Blacks, 0.53 (0.18-1.52) for Asians, and 0.64 (0.14-2.85) for other ethnicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted odds ratio for a non-White patient compared to a White patient was 0.44 (0.19-1.02) (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The non-White patients more often presented with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared to Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found an association between White patients and the presence of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Not only in Black but also in Asian patients the association with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was substantially lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the non-White population there was an association with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared to Whites </plain></SENT>
