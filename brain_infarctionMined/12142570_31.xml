<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to elucidate the effects of cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and postischemic environmental enrichment on hippocampal cell genesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was induced by a permanent ligation of the middle cerebral artery distal to the striatal branches in 6-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered as 7 consecutive daily injections starting 24 hours after surgery and animals were housed in standard or enriched environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after completed BrdU administration, BrdU incorporation and its co-localization with the neuronal markers NeuN and calbindin D28k, and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein in the granular cell layer and subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus were determined with immunohistochemistry and were quantified stereologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with sham-operated rats, rats with cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had a five-to sixfold ipsilateral increase in BrdU-labeled cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About 80% of the new cells were neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differential postischemic housing did not influence significantly the total number of surviving BrdU-labeled cells or newborn neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, postischemic environmental enrichment increased the ipsilateral generation of astrocytes normalizing the astrocyte-to-neuron ratio, which was significantly reduced in rats housed in standard environment postischemically </plain></SENT>
