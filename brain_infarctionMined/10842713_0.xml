<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase protein characterized as a transient injury specific constituent of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase SAA (A-apoSAA), as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, is present in the brain of monkeys with surgically induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of 39 months duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections from brains of normotensive monkeys (systolic blood pressure &lt; 124 mmHg) and hypertensive monkeys (systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 mmHg) were processed for immunohistochemistry with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to human A-apoSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that A-apoSAA was present in hypertensive but not in normotensive brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Staining was localized to capillary endothelial cells and occasionally to the entire vessel wall of the prefrontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining was also observed in the capillaries and in medium size vessels of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, the head of the caudate and, to a smaller extent, in the putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the A-apoSAA was present in cells forming a circular configuration within microinfarcts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> in the brain can result in either local production of A-apoSAA in the capillaries and within microinfarcts or uptake of A-apoSAA from the blood </plain></SENT>
