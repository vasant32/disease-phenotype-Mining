<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether high b-value DW images (b=2,000) are better than b=1,000 images for detection of diffusion change in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared diffusion-weighted (DW) images obtained with a b-value of 1,000 s/mm2 with those obtained with a b-value of 2,000 s/mm2 in 84 patients with small lesions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, lacuna infarction) examined within 24 hours of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative analysis was performed concerning lesion conspicuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In quantitative analysis, contrast ratios (CR) were measured and findings of b=1,000 and b=2,000 images were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>False-negative rate of b=1,000 and b=2,000 images were 23.8% and 3.6%, respectively, relative to the presense or absense of infarction on the follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> or CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On qualitative analysis, lesions were more conspicuous on b=2,000 images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On quantitative analysis, as the b-value increased, mean CR increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DW images aquired with a b-value of 2,000 s/mm2 were better than DW images aquired with a b-value of 1,000 s/mm2 for detection of diffusion change in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
