<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One common carotid artery was occluded throughout the hypotensive period, and the target pressure was monitored in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 animals with a target pressure of 14 mm Hg maintained for 90 minutes and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five animals with a target pressure of 12 mm Hg maintained for 70 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the brains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 rats with a target pressure of 17 mm Hg maintained for 80 minutes remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two further groups of five animals each with target pressures of 15 mm Hg for 80 minutes and 16 mm Hg for 90 minutes the incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was about 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no marked differences between the five groups of rats in body weight, body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, PaO2, PaCO2, arterial pH, or hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that, in the rat, the clear-cut threshold for the induction of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is a function of the severity and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence is presented indicating that this function is distinctly species-dependent, due to species differences in the dilatory capacity of the arteries supplying the brain rather than species differences in brain vulnerability </plain></SENT>
