<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous data suggested that the thalamus might participate in the generation of visual salience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>What may be the role of the thalamus in the capture by luminance transients when attentional control is in action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single experiment was administrated in a group of ten healthy volunteers as well as in a group of three patients with unilateral thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects participated in a task where attentional control was interrupted by a distractor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The meridian effect was present only in the performance of the healthy volunteers and when distractors occurred in the ipsilesional (intact) hemifield of the thalamic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that when an important signal appears during attentional focalization, the thalamus interrupts current focalization and permits the compilation of an attentional program in the midbrain aiming at generating an orienting response towards the source of this signal </plain></SENT>
