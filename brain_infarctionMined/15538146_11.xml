<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> underwent perfusion computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies &lt;3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow thresholds were used to delineate the ischemic lesion, penumbra, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the volume of the hypoperfused areas, the abnormality volume in admission DWI and follow-up CT/MRI studies, and the clinical National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume of the ischemic (core and penumbra) lesion on admission perfusion CT was correlated with the volume of admission DWI abnormalities (r=0.89, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infarcted core tissue volume (on admission CT) correlated more strongly (r=0.77, P=0.0001) than the admission DWI abnormality volume (r=0.69, P=0.002) with the follow-up <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlation was demonstrated between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in perfusion CT and follow-up DWI abnormality volume (r=0.89, r=0.77, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found between ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region volumes in perfusion CT and NIHSS admission and follow-up scores (P &lt; or = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both imaging modalities provide a sufficient assessment of the hyperacute brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, with significant correlation between them and the clinical condition at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perfusion CT allows differentiation of the penumbra and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core region with significant predictive value of follow-up <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
