<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of homozygous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> with neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> fulminans and disseminated intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) starting shortly after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the infant had vitreal <z:mp ids='MP_0006203'>eye hemorrhages</z:mp> and intraparenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, apparently as intrauterine events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 15 hours of institution of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusions the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> resolved and the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> fulminans reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> (0.4 mg/kg/day) was started on the fifth day of life, followed by gradual tapering of the FFP infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, areas of skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> healed without the need for skin grafting, and the areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> resolved without apparent sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The eye and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> may be intrauterine events and appear to be a regular feature of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Family studies are essential to establish the diagnosis, although there may be no family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, as in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homozygous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e>, but one in which early recognition and intervention may be lifesaving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ours is the youngest patient yet reported to be treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We were thus able to avoid the complications of long-term plasma therapy as well as the potential thrombotic complications of central venous catheter placement </plain></SENT>
