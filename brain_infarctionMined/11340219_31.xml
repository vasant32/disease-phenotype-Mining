<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) on MRI is common in elderly people, and recent studies have demonstrated that SBI increases the risk of progression to clinically apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an early and accurate detection of SBI and a search for potential treatable risk factors may have a significant impact on public health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Community-dwelling elderly people aged &gt;/=66 years who participated in the present study (n=153) underwent brain MRI and standardized physical and neuropsychological examinations as well as blood biochemistry determinations, including total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (pHcy), renal function, vitamin status, and polymorphisms of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SBI was found in 24.8% of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, the pHcy levels in subjects with SBI (13.6+/-4.1 micromol/L) were significantly higher (P=0.0004) than those in subjects without SBI (11.0+/-3.3 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When pHcy levels were stratified into high (&gt;/=15.1 mmol/L), moderate (11.6 to 15.0 mmol/L), and low (&lt;/=11.5 mmol/L) groups, age (P&lt;0.0001), male sex (P&lt;0.0001), the habits of cigarette smoking (P&lt;0.0001) and of alcohol consumption (P=0.0002), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels (P=0.01) were significantly associated with an elevation of pHcy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The elevated pHcy levels were significantly associated with SBI after individual adjustment for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, renal function, and the habits of smoking and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: pHcy level is associated with age and nutritional and other lifestyle factors, and it contributes to a risk for SBI </plain></SENT>
