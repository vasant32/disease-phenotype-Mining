<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six brain of subjects deceased at the age of 45 to 57 years and 9 brains of those deceased at the age of 80 to 101 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phagocytic cell immunoreactivity in both age groups during the first 5 days and on the 11th and 12th were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phagocytic reactivity in cases of patients who died on the 6th, 15th and 35th days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colliquative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with cavitation was observed in middle-aged cases from the 3rd infarction day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the senile group the beginning of tissue breakdown was noted on the 5th day, but colliquative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with cavitation was found on the 11th infarction day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Senile alterations in the biochemical components in various brain tissue elements are probably the cause of the different course and dynamics of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
