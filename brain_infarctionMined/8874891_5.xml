<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to investigate whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> phenytoin has neuroprotective effect in a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The left carotid artery of each rat was ligated, followed by 3 h of hypoxic exposure (8% O2) in a temperature-regulated environment (36 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later, brain damage was assessed by measuring loss of brain hemisphere weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenytoin had no effect on body temperature or plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, but attenuated brain damage in a dose-dependent manner (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg i.p.) when administered before the hypoxic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenytoin administered during or after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> did not alter hypoxic brain damage significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A parallel experiment using histological examination of frozen brain sections demonstrated less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after phenytoin treatment (30 mg/kg i.p.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an additional experiment measuring breakdown of an endogenous brain calpain substrate, spectrin, phenytoin treatment reduced this measure of early cellular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that pretreatment with phenytoin is neuroprotective at a plasma phenytoin concentration of approximately 12 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that blockade of voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels reduces brain damage following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
