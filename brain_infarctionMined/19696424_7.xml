<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have postulated that poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (PSD) might be related to cumulative vascular brain pathology rather than to the location and severity of a single macroinfarct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a detailed analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of microvascular lesions and lacunes in 41 prospectively documented and consecutively autopsied <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Only cases with first-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> &lt;2 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were considered as PSD in the present series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was established prospectively using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological evaluation included bilateral semiquantitative assessment of microvascular ischemic pathology and lacunes; statistical analysis included Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, and regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macroinfarct site was not related to the occurrence of PSD for any of the locations studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thalamic and basal ganglia lacunes occurred significantly more often in PSD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher lacune scores in basal ganglia, thalamus, and deep white matter were associated with an increased PSD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, microinfarct and diffuse or periventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> scores were not increased in PSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined lacune score (thalamic plus basal ganglia plus deep white matter) explained 25% of the variability of PSD occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative vascular burden resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> accumulation of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> within the thalamus, basal ganglia, and deep white matter may be more important than single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the prediction of PSD </plain></SENT>
