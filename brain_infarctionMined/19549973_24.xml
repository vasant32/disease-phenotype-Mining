<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attacks may be associated with pathologic changes in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether individuals not reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> compared with individuals reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> symptoms, particularly aura, in midlife are at increased risk of late-life <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without consideration of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based study of men and women in Reykjavik, Iceland (cohort born 1907-1935; n = 4689; 57% women) were followed up since 1967, examined, and interviewed about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> symptoms in midlife (mean age, 51 years; range, 33-65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 2002 and 2006, more than 26 years later, brain MRIs were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> once or more per month were asked about <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> symptoms including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, unilateral location, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo>, visual disturbance, and numbness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were classified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo>, or nonmigraine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment was performed at both examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions (total) and specifically located in the cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions were present in 39.3% of men and 24.6% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, and follow-up time, compared with those not reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> once or more per month (n = 3243), those with midlife <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (n = 361) had an increased risk of late-life <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8) that specifically reflected an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> in women (prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> 23.0% for women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> vs 14.5% for women not reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>; adjusted OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6 vs a 19.3% prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> for men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> vs 21.3% for men not reporting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>; adjusted OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.8; P&lt;.04 for interaction by sex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>Migraine without aura</z:hpo> and nonmigraine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> were not associated with an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>Migraine with aura</z:hpo> in midlife was associated with late-life prevalence of cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This association was statistically significant only for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> in midlife is associated with late-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in the cerebellum and in women </plain></SENT>
