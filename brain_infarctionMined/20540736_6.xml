<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CHI3L1 (YKL-40) is up-regulated in a variety of inflammatory conditions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported elevated CHI3L1 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of human and non-human primates with lentiviral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and using immunohistochemistry showed that CHI3L1 was associated with astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the current study CHI3L1 transcription and expression were evaluated in a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ELISA revealed significant elevation of CHI3L1 in the CSF of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) patients as well as mild elevation with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) showed CHI3L1 transcription mostly associated with reactive astrocytes, that was more pronounced in inflammatory conditions like lentiviral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of CHI3L1 expression in different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> showed that YKL40 was abundantly expressed in astrocytes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases and diminished to low levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CHI3L1 is induced in astrocytes in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> but that it is most abundantly associated with astrocytes in regions of inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
