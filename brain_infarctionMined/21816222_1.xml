<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with tPA may lead to disruption of the blood-brain barrier and hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>17Î²-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) has demonstrated efficacy in reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of E2 on permeability of the blood-brain barrier and its ability to prevent hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic rats treated with tPA have not previously been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that neurological deficits, brain water content, and Evan's blue extravasation were increased in ovariectomized female Wistar rats treated with tPA and attenuated in rats receiving E2+tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that intracerebral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity were elevated with tPA treatment, and these increases were reduced by E2 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of E2 is capable of ameliorating some of the adverse effects of tPA administration, including the increase of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, blood-brain barrier permeability, and hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in thrombolytic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
