<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was induced in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg), or phosphate-buffered saline (n=6 per group) was given daily for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI studies were performed 2 to 3 days before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, and at 1 to 2 hours and 1, 2, 7, 14, and 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> evolution was assessed via <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> volume measurements using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and tissue loss using T2 maps and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral tests were done before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and at various time points post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional histological measures were performed with doublecortin neuronal nuclei and bromodeoxyuridine stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> volumes determined by SWI were similar across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> significantly reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> volume at 4 weeks (P=0.002 versus control with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> volumes as baseline), whereas that for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> was marginal (P=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI estimates of tissue loss (% of contralateral hemisphere) for treated rats were significantly lower (P=0.0003 and 0.001, respectively) than for control at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for H&amp;E histology (P=0.0003 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tissue loss estimates between MRI and histology were well correlated (R2=0.764, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement in neurological function was seen 2 to 4 weeks post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> with increased neurogenesis observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> significantly improved neurological recovery, decreased tissue loss, and increased neurogenesis when administered for 1 week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
