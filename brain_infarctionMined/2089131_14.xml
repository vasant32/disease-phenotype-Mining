<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These symptomatic hyperglycemic cats may develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and will show diffuse neuronal injury or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> depending on length of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain mitochondria isolated from symptomatic but not asymptomatic cats have decreased <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>- and uncoupler-stimulated oxygen consumption rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since impaired respiration could result from altered electron transport chain function, we measured <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, b, and aa3 concentrations and the activities of the five electron transfer complexes in isolated brain mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic cats marked alterations were present in particular in complex IV, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase, with a 57% reduction in activity and a 45% reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26348">prosthetic group</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> aa3) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Less marked reductions in other segments of the chain included 27% and 41% decreases, respectively, in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> concentrations and in electron transfer complex II, succinate:<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> oxidoreductase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">Cytochrome b</z:chebi> concentrations and complex I, II and V activities were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small but significant decreases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> aa3 concentrations (18%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase activity (20%) were also present in mitochondria from postanoxic hyperglycemic cats prior to appearance of neurologic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that delayed decreases in the activities of specific electron transfer complexes are correlated with impaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> respiration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> in postanoxic hyperglycemic cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is presently unclear if these postanoxic brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> alterations are primary or secondary events in the development of brain injury </plain></SENT>
