<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate why spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) develop larger brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> distal to an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> than normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, we determined the surface and volume densities of cerebral capillaries, and the regional cerebral blood flow distal to an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in SHR and WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was chosen because the middle cerebral artery territory is most commonly affected by cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surface and volume densities of capillaries in the neocortex of the middle cerebral artery territory were measured by stereological techniques on histological sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes after ligation of the right middle cerebral artery, regional cerebral blood flow was measured autoradiographically by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The capillary density of the neocortex did not differ between the SHR and WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blood flow was significantly lower within the middle cerebral artery territory in the SHR than in the WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reduced blood flow distal to the occlusion in SHR is probably a consequence of structural adaptation of arterial resistance vessels, rather than being caused by reduced capillary density </plain></SENT>
