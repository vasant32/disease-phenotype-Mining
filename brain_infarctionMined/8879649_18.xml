<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the histopathology of spastic muscles in patients with spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> using specimens obtained from the gastrocnemius muscles during orthopedic operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though there was no disease-specific abnormality, we found changes in fiber type distribution, i.e., type-1 fiber predominance and type-2B fiber deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These changes were not found in the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> at age 1 year 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variation in fiber size, especially in type-1 fibers, was also detected in older patients and at the more severely affected sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We speculated that the influence on the spinal motor unit from upper motor cortex might be applicable to the muscle histological findings and the time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the brain damage might be important </plain></SENT>
