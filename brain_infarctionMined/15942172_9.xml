<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this 5-year follow-up study was to assess functional and cognitive outcome in relation to MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 81 patients with a first-ever LI were followed for 5 years with respect to mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, functional and cognitive outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T(2)-weighted MRI was performed at baseline and at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of basal ganglia lesions and white matter lesions was scored according to the European Task Force rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed with the Oxford Handicap Scale (OHP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognition was assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year mortality was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.1) and impairment score (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>30% of the patients had a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-7.4) and amount of white matter lesions (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>36% of the patients were functionally dependent (defined as OHP &gt;2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Predictors for functional dependency were impairment score (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.12-2.59), MMSE (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.91) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (OR = 84, 95% CI 9.4-745) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>16% of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (defined as MMSE &lt;24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and white matter score, but not basal ganglia score, were correlated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many LI patients have a good functional outcome at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For older patients, for patients with an initial severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and with additional vascular risk factors, however, the prognosis is more severe, with an increased risk for mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, and physical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
