<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Autonomic failure</z:e> is known to manifest commonly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but very little attention has been given to various features of sympathetic dysfunction such as sudomotor dysregulation in cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, our purpose was to assess quantitatively sympathetic reflex activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by measuring the sympathetic skin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recorded the sympathetic skin response to electric and auditory stimulations simultaneously on both hands in 58 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and in 36 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response amplitudes were significantly decreased and the latencies prolonged in both hemispheral (n = 49) and brain stem (n = 9) infarctions compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes were diminished in both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and late phases of infarction, but the latencies were prolonged only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sympathetic dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> seems to be much more extensive than has previously been thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have demonstrated impaired sympathetic skin responses, reflecting definite suppression of the reflex activity of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
