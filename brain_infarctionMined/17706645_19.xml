<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 contributes to adult neurogenesis after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we studied the temporal profile of endogenous <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 expression and the effects of human recombinant <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 on neurogenesis and neurological functions in an experimental focal ischemic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain, <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 expression was observed only in the SVZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic brain, <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 expression was markedly upregulated in the SVZ and the area of selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The temporal profile of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 expression was correlated with that of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the SVZ of the ischemic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double-labeling studies revealed that <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 was localized predominantly in both reactive astrocytes and SVZ astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1, which is known to have carbohydrate-binding ability, into the lateral ventricle increased neurogenesis in the ipsilateral SVZ and improved sensorimotor dysfunction after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, blockade of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 in the SVZ by the administration of anti-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 neutralizing antibody strongly inhibited neurogenesis and diminished neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 is one of the principal regulators of adult SVZ neurogenesis through its carbohydrate-binding ability and provide evidence that <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-1 protein has a role in the improvement of sensorimotor function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
