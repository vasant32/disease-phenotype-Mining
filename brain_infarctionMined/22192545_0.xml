<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study of 28 patients with 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the paraclinoid in whom treatment with endovascular techniques was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient age, sex, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> type, size of aneurismal sac and treatment modality were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation and control angiography were performed between one and 43 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, complete occlusion was obtained in 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (86.6%), nearly complete (&gt;90%) occlusion in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (6.7%) and incomplete occlusion was observed in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> endovascular techniques were successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications were observed in two patients (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent follow-up for a mean of 14.8 months (range 1-43 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeated coil treatment was performed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient died of massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> six days postoperatively and thus no follow-up data were available for this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 27 patients with follow-up studies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> closure was complete in 22 (81.5%) and incomplete in five (18.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment is a safe and efficient alternative approach for paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
