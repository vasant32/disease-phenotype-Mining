<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the time course of ET-release in three different sources: CSF, plasma and microdialysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective study ET-1-concentrations were measured in plasma, cisternal CSF and microdialysate in 20 patients with aneurysmal SAH for at least 8 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ET-1 concentration in microdialysate was almost four times higher compared to CSF and plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(p&lt;0.001) Only in CSF ET-1-release showed a significant increase over time with highest values on day 5 post ictus (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was parallel to the increase of transcranial Doppler velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1 in plasma and microdialysate did not change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ET-1 may have a different biological function in different biological tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only ET-1 in CSF seemed to be associated with CVS </plain></SENT>
