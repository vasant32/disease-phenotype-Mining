<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that is believed to promote cell viability in many different cell types, including neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we observed the state of Akt phosphorylation at several time points (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) during permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We detected a transient upregulation of Akt phosphorylation at 1 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAO) by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining revealed that the enhanced phosphorylation of Akt occurred mainly in neurons located in the outer area of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (ischemic penumbra) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was accompanied by the nuclear translocation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that Akt enzymatic activity is elevated in both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of brain tissue subjected to 1 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB), an intranuclear target molecule of Akt, exhibited increased phosphorylation after 1 h of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model, caspase-3 was activated in the central part of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory as little as 1 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, caspase-3 activation was not recognized at this time in the outer area of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, where Akt activity was upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that prosurvival cell signaling is initiated in an active fashion before cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathways are activated in neurons situated in the ischemic penumbra at the early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
