<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the extent of WMC affect the type and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was undertaken to determine if WMC influences cognition in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited consecutive patients who were admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, mainly documented by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WMC were measured qualitatively and quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into quartiles according to the distribution of the volume of WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cognition was assessed 12 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by psychometric tests (Chinese version of Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's Disease</z:e> Assessment Scale-cognition [ADAS-cog], Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale-Initiation/ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233651" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Perseveration</z:e> subscale [MDRS I/P]) and was compared between patients with varying severity of WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to find variables that influenced performance in the psychometric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 94 included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, those patients (n=25) within the highest quartile of WMC were older, had more lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and lower prestroke cognitive function compared with those with less WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, their performances in psychometric tests were significantly more impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that WMC significantly influenced performance in MDRS I/P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>WMC did not independently influence performance in MMSE and ADAS-cog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extent of WMC appears to be associated with executive dysfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further large prospective studies with extensive scales of executive function testing are required to confirm this issue </plain></SENT>
