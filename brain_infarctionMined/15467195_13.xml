<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the effect of wogonin, a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> originated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis GEORGI, on focal ischemic brain injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> was induced by the permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) for 24 h with a <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> rubber cylinder inserted through the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that wogonin, intraperitoneally administered at a dosage of 20 mg/kg at 30 min before and 4 h after the surgery, reduced the pMCAO-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas in the cerebral cortex as well as in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total volume of infarction was significantly reduced by the treatment with wogonin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, wogonin was found to significantly improve the pMCAO-induced behavioral deficits at 24 h after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results demonstrate that wogonin inhibits ischemic brain injury and improves behavioral dysfunction caused by pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings, along with previous reports demonstrating the neuroprotective effects of wogonin, provide strong pharmacological basis for the use of wogonin or Scutellaria baicalensis in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
