<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">Inosine</z:chebi>, a naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26394">purine nucleoside</z:chebi>, stimulates neurons to extend axons in culture and, in vivo, enhances the ability of undamaged neurons to form axon collaterals after brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular changes induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> are unknown, as is the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> to restore complex functions associated with a specific cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a unilateral injury model limited to the sensorimotor cortex, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> triples the number of corticospinal tract axons that project from the unaffected hemisphere and form synaptic bouton-like structures in the denervated half of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes correlate with improved recovery in animals' ability to grasp and consume food pellets with the affected forepaw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies using laser-capture microdissection and microarray analysis show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> profoundly affects gene expression in corticospinal neurons contralateral to the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">Inosine</z:chebi> attenuates transcriptional changes caused by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, while upregulating the expression of genes associated with axon growth and the complement cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> alters gene expression in neurons contralateral to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, enhances the ability of these neurons to form connections on the denervated side of the spinal cord, and improves performance with the impaired limb </plain></SENT>
