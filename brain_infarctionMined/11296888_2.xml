<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Due to an increase in age of the patient population in cardiac surgery, cerebral complications are increasing in frequency, also as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to reveal cerebral pathology associated with a fatal outcome after cardiac surgery, we re-evaluated the cast angiographs and medico-legal autopsy documents of 144 adult cardiac surgery subjects over a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Special attention was paid to the ability of post-mortem cast angiography to aid in diagnosing cerebral pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The autopsy detected new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> in 29 (20%) cases, of which 22 (15.3%) were recent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and 7 were cases of anoxic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the recent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 12 were associated with cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 4 showed multiple lesions, and the remaining 6 were small single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, one subject had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and 72 (50%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By cast angiography, the leakage of contrast medium in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and stenoses of intracranial and cervical arteries could be well demonstrated and also revealed 17 (77%) of the 22 recent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found to be suitable for detecting recent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> associated with main cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, with a sensitivity of 92% (11 out of 12 cases), but was less sensitive in showing small recent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with a sensitivity of 60% (6 out of 10 cases) and inferior for the older ones where none of the 6 cases were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Filling defects caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> were difficult to differentiate from technical errors and were encountered in 7 (4.8%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant predictor for the 29 recent ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> was perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The immediate cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was most often of cardiac (83%) and cerebral (14%) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 14 cases, cerebral damage was considered to be an additional cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of cerebral post-mortem cast angiography should be recommended, especially for its excellent ability to visualize intravascular pathology such as arterial stenoses and thromboses, with a 92% sensitivity in showing new main cerebral artery thromboses, before likely distortion of the vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> by dissection </plain></SENT>
