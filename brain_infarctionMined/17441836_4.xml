<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Risk of developing AD was examined for 155 cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> older adults (77.4 years, 60% women, 81% white) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MTL volumes and the presence of WMH and of subclinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were determined from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the beginning of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up cognitive evaluations (average 4.3 years) identified those who developed AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of either MTL <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or subclinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was independently and significantly associated with a greater risk to develop AD (OR [95% CI]: 4.4 [1.5, 12.3] and 2.7 [1.0, 7.1], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, those participants with both MTL <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and at least one brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had a 7-fold increase in the risk of developing AD (OR [95% CI]: 7.0 [1.5, 33.1]), compared to those who had neither of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> older adults, markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> (as reflected by MTL <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>) and of cerebrovascular disease (as reflected by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI) independently contribute to the risk to develop AD </plain></SENT>
