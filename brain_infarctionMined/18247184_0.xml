<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may lead to further complications, some of which may be severe, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though rarely, it can therefore be a potential cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 34-year old woman under ovulation induction treatment who developed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> secondary to internal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation was administered and recovery was good in spite of the persistence of carotid occlusion in follow-up magnetic ressonance imaging- angiographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of carotid occlusion following an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OHSS</z:e> reported in Spain and the eighth one published in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current literature on cerebrovascular complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OHSS</z:e> is also briefly reviewed </plain></SENT>
