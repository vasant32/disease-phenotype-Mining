<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMBs have been detected even in neurologically healthy persons, who also seem prone to be affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, not only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> but also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of CMB was investigated in brain dock participants, making reference to silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (SLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants comprised 377 neurologically healthy persons and 21 (5.6%) had CMB detected, which was associated with a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, other conventional risk factors having no significant correlation with CMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a simple correlation analysis, CMB showed a positive association with age and systolic blood pressure (SBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that SLI was the factor most strongly associated with CMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, individuals who had both CMB and SLI had higher SBP than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of CMB is similar to that of SLI </plain></SENT>
