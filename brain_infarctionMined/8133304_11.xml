<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR) is significantly more reduced in patients with hemispheric low-flow infarctions than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> due to arterio-arterial embolism, a series of 64 consecutive patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CVMR was calculated from relative changes of blood flow velocity within the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) during hypo- and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The configuration of the circle of Willis (COW) was also determined by TCD using common carotid artery compression tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anterior, posterior or ophthalmic artery collateral flow, and absence or combinations of these, were differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT scans were categorized as showing either no infarction (group I; n = 20) or territorial (group II; n = 28), or low-flow infarctions (group III; n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, CVMR was significantly reduced but equal in groups I and II, however, even more reduced in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVMR was lowest, and low-flow infarctions were most frequent in patients whose collateral hemispheric blood supply was from the ophthalmic artery as opposed to patients with a complete or nearly complete COW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that low-flow infarctions in extracranial ICA occlusions represent brain damage due to a critical reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, as opposed to thromboembolically induced lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The configuration of the COW seems to play the key role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings also support the view that the pattern of hemispheric infarction seen on CT indicates the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
