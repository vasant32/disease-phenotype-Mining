<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, NBP is limited to use in the clinic by other side effects, such as elevated aminotransferase, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> and digestive response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some derivates of NBP were synthesized with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16042,33958,46714">halides</z:chebi> (F, Cl and Br) on the 6-position, and their IR and Raman spectra were measured </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By comparing the spectra of the NBP, the band of disubstituted <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> disappeared in the derivatives, and the band of trisubstituted <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzenes</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stretching vibrational band of C--H was detected in the Raman spectra, but was not observed in IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the low frequency region, the deformation vibration band of --C--C--C--C was also observed in the Raman spectra </plain></SENT>
