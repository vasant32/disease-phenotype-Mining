<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These lesions are also frequent in patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether plasma amyloid beta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (Abeta) levels are associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions in the general population, and whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE) genotype modifies these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 1,077 participants within the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study, who were 60 to 90 years of age and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional associations were analyzed by regression models with adjustments for age, sex, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In APOE epsilon4 carriers, plasma Abeta levels were positively associated with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions, whereas in noncarriers no associations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Per standard deviation increase in Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) levels the odds ratios for lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-2.43) and 1.93 (95% CI = 1.31-2.85), the periventricular white matter lesion grade increased by 0.32 (95% CI = 0.08-0.57) and 0.29 (95% CI = 0.00-0.57), and the subcortical white matter lesion volume increased by 0.48 ml (95% CI = 0.04-0.91) and 0.24 ml (95% CI = -0.27-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher Abeta levels are associated with more lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions in elderly subjects who carry an APOE epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
