<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging is more sensitive for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than CT, and apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) mapping permits quantification of the severity of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between early CT findings, ischemic lesion volume on DW images, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in whom early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were detected on baseline CT scans were scored CT positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline DW lesion volumes were compared between the CT-positive and CT-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In CT-positive patients, we outlined the CT-positive part of the DW lesion and transferred these regions of interest to the corresponding DW sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of the outlined CT-positive areas were then compared with the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of the CT-negative areas within patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesions with significantly increased T2 hyperintensity were excluded to correct for the effect of early vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in whom both CT and DW imaging were performed within 8 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with early CT signs of infarction (n = 12) had significantly larger DW lesion volumes than did patients without early CT abnormalities (mean volume, 62.8 versus 14.6 mL; P = </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients displaying early CT abnormalities, CT-positive regions of the DW lesion had lower relative <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (rADC) values than did the CT-negative regions, when lesions with significant T2 hyperintensity were excluded (mean rADC, 0.65 versus 0.75; P =.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that early CT signs of infarction indicate more extensive and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, as reflected by lower <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
