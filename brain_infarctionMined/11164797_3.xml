<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that a single intracarotid arterial injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) can dramatically reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in rats subjected to transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present experiments were undertaken to investigate whether intracarotid arterial injection of CsA reduces brain damage after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is also an efficacious factor in preventing ischemic brain damage, in the second part of the experiments we tested whether a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and CsA would provide additional brain protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of a 30-min duration was induced in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CsA (10 mg/kg) was injected into the carotid artery immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> was instituted after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by allowing spontaneous head temperature to fall to 30-32 degrees C, while body temperature was upheld at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that vehicle-treated animals could not survive beyond 1-2 days after reperfusion, and the histopathological outcome in a separate group of rats perfusion-fixed after 1 day reperfusion showed 80-100% brain damage in the caudoputamen, and in the hippocampal CA1, CA3, CA4 and dentate gyrus subregions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microinfarction and grade 3 damage were frequently observed in the cingulate and parietal cortex and in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CsA moderately prolonged animal survival to 3 days after reperfusion and reduced brain damage to grade 2 in the cortical areas and the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> further increased animal survival to at least 6 days after reperfusion and reduced brain damage to 30% in the caudoputamen, to close to zero in the CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus, and to grade 1-2 in the cortical areas and the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and CsA did not give additional protection </plain></SENT>
