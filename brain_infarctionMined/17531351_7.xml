<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the inducement in vitro, the ES cell-derived cells expressed Nestin and MAP-2, rather than GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, ES cell-derived cells can survive, migrate into the injury site, and specifically differentiate into neurons, showing improvement of the learning ability and memory of the HIE mouse at 8 months post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The non-grafted HIE mouse brain showed typical pathological changes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where the number of neurons was reduced, while in the cell graft group, number of the neurons increased in the same regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although further study is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms responsible for this functional recovery, we believe that ES cells have advantages for use as a donor source in HIE </plain></SENT>
