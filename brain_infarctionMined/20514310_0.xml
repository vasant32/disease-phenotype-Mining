<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its etiology and prognosis are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe clinical presentations and neurodevelopmental outcomes of our case series of perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen term and preterm neonates who were diagnosed with perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in two university hospitals from March 2003 to March 2007 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven term and 6 preterm neonates were diagnosed with perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, based on the brain MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (4/13), perinatal distress (3/13) in term neonates, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in preterm neonates did not present with noticeable clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one neonate had positive thrombophilic test (homozygous C677T polymorphism for MTHFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten neonates had infarctions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), and 3 neonates had borderzone infarctions between the anterior cerebral artery and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental outcome was abnormal in 4 neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infarction in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main branch or posterior limb of internal capsule showed an abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study is the first systematic study of perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Korea, and shows its clinical presentations and neurodevelopmental outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The population-based study on incidence and prognosis of perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Korea is required in the future </plain></SENT>
