<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the outcome predictors of TBM at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Those patients with TBM who could be sequentially followed up for 6 and 12 months were included in this prospective, hospital-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome was defined at 6 and 12 months by Barthel Index (BI) score into complete (BI = 20), partial (BI = 12-19) and poor (BI&lt;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was included in the 'poor recovery' group for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters were evaluated by multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients with TBM aged between 1 and 64 years (mean 25.6 years), 18 of whom were females and 17 children below 12 years, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients were followed up for 6 months and 56 for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months' follow-up 37 patients had complete recovery, three partial, six poor and 12 had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 40 patients had complete recovery, one partial and three poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best set of parameters predicting outcome at 6 and 12 months included stage of TBM, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GCS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, GCS and infarction in predicting the long term outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
