<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the patients were divided into those with SCS (23 patients, Group 1) and those without SCS (49 patients, Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was then compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients (13%) in Group 1 developed symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>; this is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), compared with the patients in Group 2, none of whom experienced symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that SCS is a predictor of symptomatic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is thought to be important to diagnose SCS using cranial MRI or computed tomography and to keep patients with SCS under close surveillance </plain></SENT>
