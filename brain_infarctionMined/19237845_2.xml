<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The microscopic examination of pediatric dura mater is often undertaken to look for evidence of recent, resolving, or remote craniocerebral trauma </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined grossly unremarkable dura mater from 11 children, utilizing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, iron, CD-34, CD-68, and epithelial membrane antigen stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pediatric dura mater is a relatively vascular tissue, particularly on its internal and external surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several sections contained iron deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the para-sagittal and many of the lateral dura mater sections contained intradural blood, whereas dura mater attached to bone did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intradural blood could arise by several mechanisms, including the act of removing the dura mater from the calvarium during the autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD-34 staining showed potential as a means to differentiate the internal from the external dural surfaces </plain></SENT>
