<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to review the occurrence, presentation, and associated risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in infants at a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Inpatient electronic records identified infants between March 2002 and March 2011 who had perinatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten infants had perinatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 50% were outborn, 20% were indigenous, and mortality was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median birth weight was 2970 g (range 1699 to 3443 g), and median gestation was 36 weeks (range 32 to 41 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perinatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were left sided in three, right sided in three, and bilateral in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presentation included four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, one with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and one without symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 10 cases reported in this series, there was a maternal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo>, although the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> in Australia is only 4.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus in our cases appears to be very much higher than the average population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are needed to determine if <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus is a risk factor for perinatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
