<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a promising agent for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, current methods of FGF2 administration are associated with a short circulating half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An FGF2 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52254">apatite</z:chebi> coating was developed as a slow-releasing drug delivery system (DDS) by forming an FGF2/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9679">calcium phosphate</z:chebi> composite layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">Hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> was coated with high or low doses of FGF2, denoted as FGF-high and FGF-low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the efficacy of the coating as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, an FGF2 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52254">apatite</z:chebi>-coated implant was inserted, and the rat brains were removed 2weeks after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats in groups treated with FGF-high had significantly smaller areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, particularly in the external capsule and the lateral side of the putamen, and better capillary density than rats in groups treated with non-FGF2 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52254">apatite</z:chebi>-coated implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic analysis indicated that the new vessels were larger and had thicker walls in the FGF2 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52254">apatite</z:chebi>-coated groups than in the non-FGF2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence immunohistochemistry of the peri-infarction region showed that FGF2 released from FGF2 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52254">apatite</z:chebi>-coated implants might have biological activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fluorescence immunohistochemistry showed that released FGF2 influenced microglia cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This new FGF2 DDS involving an FGF2 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="52254">apatite</z:chebi> coating can prevent infarction of the penumbra through the multipotential effects of FGF2 </plain></SENT>
