<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 316 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) were enrolled and had CRP determinations; they were dichotomized as&lt;7 or ≥7mg/L according to the previous report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>128 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> who also had CRP measurements were selected as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A possible level-risk relationship between elevated CRP and NIHSS, which considered relatively severe illness as a value���8, was studied within the AIS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CRP was elevated in 21% of the AIS compared to 4% in the control group (p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the AIS group, patients with CRP levels ≥7mg/L had a significantly increased risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.84-6.00, p =0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subtype <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the highest rate of elevated CRP and NIHSS were in those with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (CE) using TOAST classification, total anterior circulation infarction (TACI) of OCSP classification and large volume infarction (LVI) of Adams classification; the odds ratio(OR) between elevated CRP and NIHSS was 6.14 (95% CI 1.43-26.44) in CE, 1.714 (95% CI 1.30-2.26) in TACI, 2.32 (95% CI 1.08-4.99) in LVI, and the p value were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> below 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated CRP level can reflect the severity of AIS, which was association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
