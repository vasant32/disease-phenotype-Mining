<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are few reported cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> attributed to retrograde cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> from central venous catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanism and the necessary conditions are not fully understood, also because of missing experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed experimental simulation while working on a possible case of retrograde cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hermetic system consisting of two containers connected to each other and to an electric pump by means of rubber hoses was built </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this system, a fluid (water and blood) could continuously flow under conditions similar to those of the common jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The part of the system representing the jugular vein could be freely positioned at angles between 0 and 90° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A central venous catheter was inserted into this part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After disconnection, the behavior of the air bubbles entering the hose through the tip of the catheter was evaluated at different positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At angles between 0 and 45°, the air bubbles followed the fluid flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At angles &gt;45°, the air bubbles showed the tendency to flow upstream; this phenomenon was more evident the more vertically the hose was located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We were able to demonstrate that a retrograde <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> can be caused by a disconnected catheter and is even more likely if the neck is in a vertical position </plain></SENT>
