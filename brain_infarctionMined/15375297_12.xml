<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated if the location of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> was crucial for changes of motor cortex excitability and if the electrophysiological findings were correlated with motor performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to study intracortical inhibition (ICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), motor thresholds, and corticospinal excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dexterity as a measure of motor performance was tested with the Nine-Hole-Peg Test (9HPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ratios (affected/unaffected) were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICI and ICF ratios were negatively correlated with 9HPT ratios in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with an age-matched control group, patients with lesions in the territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) (n=3) or a lesion rostral of the dentate nucleus (n=1) had abnormally enhanced ICI and a loss of ICF (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dexterity was impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Motor excitability and motor performance normalized over the subsequent weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> either in the territory of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (n=2) or in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (n=3) displayed motor excitability and motor performance within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The superior part of the cerebellum has a strong influence on motor cortex excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the enhancement of motor inhibition and reduction of motor facilitation is mediated by an impairment of the deep cerebellar nuclei </plain></SENT>
