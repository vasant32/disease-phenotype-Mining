<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The molecular basis for the antithrombin (AT) deficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) combined in a Japanese patient was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed candidate genes -SERPINC1 for AT deficiency, and TNNT2 and LMNA for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the characteristics of recombinant mutant AT and evaluated the LMNA mutation associated with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> by molecular modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genome sequencing of SERPINC1 revealed a C-to-A transversion in exon 6 that resulted in a p.Pro439Thr mutation of AT, which was previously reported as a pleiotropic effect type II AT deficiency (AT Budapest5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, expression experiments with recombinant 439Thr-AT showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity, slightly reduced secretion, and low specific activity, which suggested that this mutation exhibits an intermediate feature of type I and type II AT deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a survey of gene abnormalities causing <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, we found no causative gene defect in TNNT2; however, we identified a G-to-C transversion in LMNA that resulted in a novel p.Asp357His mutation in lamin A/C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This acidic-to-basic residue substitution might have impaired the head-to-tail association of two lamin dimers leading to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, we identified both SERPINC1 and LMNA mutations in the patient's daughter and son, both of whom had AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that a p.Pro439Thr mutation in SERPINC1 and a p.Asp357His mutation in LMNA might have cosegregated in this family, associated with AT deficiency and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified missense mutations in SERPINC1 and LMNA genes to be associated with AT deficiency and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, respectively, which might have cosegregated in the family of the patient </plain></SENT>
