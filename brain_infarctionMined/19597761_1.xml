<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The frequency and pattern of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> abnormalities among patients with traumatic brain injury have been the subject matter of very few studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was intended to assess the pattern of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> dysfunction following severe head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Severe head injury patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from January to December in 1 year formed the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from clinical assessment, NCCT of the head was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A complete anterior pituitary hormone analysis was performed within 24 h of injury and was repeated at 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months amongst patients who survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty of our patients succumbed in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rest of the patients were followed up for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> followed by prolactin were the most common hormonal derangements at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Midline shift on CT scans was inversely related to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> elevation and directly related to GH elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> on CT scans was inversely related to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and LH elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant alteration was found in the decreasing trend of the mean T4 values and normalisation or a decreasing trend from initially elevated mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and GH levels during follow-up (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that abnormalities in hormonal profiles appear to be relatively common in severe traumatic brain injury and fluctuate significantly over at least 6 months; there is a correlation with age and radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Performance of hormonal analysis evaluation should be considered in patients with severe brain injury so that appropriate hormonal replacement can be done to optimise the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
