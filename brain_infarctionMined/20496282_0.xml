<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also tried to determine prognostic factors of late recurrent ischaemic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups: group I comprised 124 individuals with recurrence within the first year, and group II - 98 individuals in whom the recurrent episode appeared within the fifth year or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of patients in group I demonstrated evident stenosis (70% or more) of internal carotid artery ipsilateral to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this group more cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were found compared to group II, while in the latter, predominantly lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> appeared (p = 0.046 and 0.0002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group II patients significantly more frequently reported <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> application, including systematic drug use (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evident differences were found between groups considering other important non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small differences between risk factors of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> profiles in patients with early and late recurrent episodes do not allow us to distinguish unequivocally a group of patients with better prognosis regarding the time of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of antiplatelet drugs, either systematic or non-systematic, and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are independent, positive prognostic factors of delay of potential recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
