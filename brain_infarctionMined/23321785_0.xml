<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that activation of the glial-specific purinergic receptor, P2Y(1)R, reduces both astrocyte swelling and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in a photothrombotic mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These restorative effects were dependent on astrocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we extend these findings and report that P2Y(1)R stimulation with the purinergic ligand 2-methylthioladenosine 5' <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (2MeSADP) reduces and partially reverses neuronal damage induced by photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was confocally imaged in transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein under the control of the Thy1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potentials, monitored with the potential sensitive dye tetra-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> rhodamine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, were depolarized after photothrombosis and subsequently repolarized when P2Y(1)Rs were stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice deficient in the astrocyte-specific type 2 inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor exhibited aggravated ischemic dendritic damage after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these mice with 2MeSADP did not invoke an intracellular Ca(2+) response, did not repolarize astrocyte mitochondria, and did not reduce or partially reverse neuronal lesions induced by photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that IP(3)-Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytes is not only critical for P2Y(1)R-enhanced protection, but suggest that IP(3)-Ca(2+) signaling is also a key component of endogenous neuroprotection.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 16 January 2013; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.214 </plain></SENT>
