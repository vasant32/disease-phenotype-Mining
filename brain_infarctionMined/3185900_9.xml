<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent of patients (135/1,203) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history had ischemic lesions on their first CT, unrelated to the presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank files were reviewed to determine whether the occurrence, location, and CT characteristics of those lesions are associated with their undetected status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two distinct patterns were seen: (1) Small lesions of 1 cm or less were left hemisphere predominant and involved the deep structures of the brain; the majority of these were clinically silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Lesions greater than 1 cm occurred more frequently in the right hemisphere and were mostly superficial; these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> produced signs unrecognized by the patient or family </plain></SENT>
