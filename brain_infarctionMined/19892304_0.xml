<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aim to evaluate prospectively the long-term changes of blood pressure (BP) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and compare them with the clinic conventional measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 101 patients who were admitted within 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the circadian rhythm of BP a continuous BP monitor (Spacelab 90207) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After six and twelve months follow-up a new ABPM was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using the SSPS 12.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 62 males and 39 females, mean age: 70.9+/-10.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We included 88 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and 13 hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase mean 24 h BPs were 136+/-19/78.6+/-11.4 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diurnal variation in BP was abolished in 88 (87.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After six months, 74 patients were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean office readings were 137.5+/-23.8/76.4+/-11.4 mm Hg, and high systolic BPs and diastolic BPs were found in 37% and 11% of the subjects respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ABPM revealed a mean BP of 118.5+/-20.1/70.3+/-8.6 (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 57 (76.9%), the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BP pattern remained abolished (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After one year, 63 patients were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean office readings were 130.8+/-26.3/77.6+/-9.3 mm Hg, and high systolic BPs and diastolic BPs were found in 23.8% and 10% of the subjects respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean 24 h BPs were 117+/-12.5/69.7+/-7.2 (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diurnal variation in BP was now abolished in 47 (74.6%) patients (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, both hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients, present a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disruption of circadian rhythm of BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Conventional clinical recordings are an unreliable method of controlling these patients and ABPM should be routinely performed in this population </plain></SENT>
