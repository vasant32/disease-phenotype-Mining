<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure variability (BPV) includes physiological and random variations in blood pressure (BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Commonly used approaches, such as standard deviation (SD) and weighted standard deviation (wSD) methods, do not efficiently assess random variation in BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we propose a novel method to assess individual BP variations, extracting random variation in BP by eliminating physiological variation mathematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This novel assessment method furthers our understanding of the relationship between BP variation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LACI) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analysed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring recordings taken from 1526 men aged 60-98 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual curves were created using a mathematical method and the related BP variation calculated, namely the SD for individual BP variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, correlations between LACI and BP variations as determined by the classical SD method, wSD and our novel assessment method (SD') were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that 24 h variations in systolic BP (SBP) were closely associated with LACI when the SD and wSD methods were used (P &lt; 0.05), but the most significant correlations were observed when the SD' method was used (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using SD' yielded the lowest value of the parameter P among the three different methods used to analyse BPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using the SD' method, a significant correlation was found between variations in SBP and the incidence of LACI (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was found that the incidence of LACI increased by 2% with each 1 mmHg increase in SBP variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our novel assessment method enables mathematical removal of interference from physiological BP variation and the results show a better correlation with LACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thus, our novel method may be considered a simple index of 24 h BP variation that is superior to conventional SD and wSD methods </plain></SENT>
