<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronobiological analyses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> may throw some light on the mechanisms that trigger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Observations may generate new hypotheses for identifying significant causal relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, both the circadian and the weekend and holiday versus workday times of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262005" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemic cerebral infarction</z:e> were determined for 723 consecutive subjects, aged 16 to 60 years, who were admitted for hospital treatment in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase without any selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among young adults (16 to 40 years) and women, more infarctions occurred during weekends and holidays than were expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Young women in particular had an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> during weekends and holidays (odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 3.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, age of 16 to 30 years (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.57 to 6.50), female sex (OR 1.71; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.63), and recent drinking of alcohol (P &lt; .01) were associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> during weekends and holidays, whereas current cigarette smoking was associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> during workdays (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A morning increase in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was observed among middle-aged people during both weekends/holidays and workdays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among young adults, however, an evening increase was also seen during weekends/holidays and workdays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that young adults and women are frequently stricken by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> during weekends and holidays and that the circadian distribution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> among young adults is different from that of middle-aged people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that there may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-triggering activities that are associated with lifestyle </plain></SENT>
