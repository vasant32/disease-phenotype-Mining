<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in human babies is a serious condition associated with permanent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is increasingly used for early diagnosis of brain injury in human babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the presence of DWI abnormalities and cellular injury, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, during the neonatal period are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We asked whether the extent of injury depicted on DWI can predict the presence of caspase-3 activation, a quantitative marker of apoptotic injury, after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (H-I) in postnatal day 7 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Injury volume was determined by DWI at 2 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days after H-I and compared with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 activation and <z:mp ids='MP_0008918'>microgliosis</z:mp> were determined at 24 hours post-H-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWI-defined lesions (eg, decreased apparent diffusion coefficient) at 24 hours post-H-I correlated with a major increase in caspase-3 activity in the injured hemisphere and predicted injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A modest but significant increase in caspase-3 activity occurred in the cortex of rats that had no apparent diffusion coefficient decrease in the injured hemisphere but had unilaterally enlarged regions of high apparent diffusion coefficient at the ipsilateral ventricle/white matter interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 activity was similar in both hemispheres in pups with unchanged DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal DWI signal at 24 hours post-H-I is predictive of caspase-3 activation and can be used as an indicator that injury involving an apoptotic-like mechanism is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest that the presence of an enlarged unilateral region with high apparent diffusion coefficient at the ventricle/white matter interface without significant apparent diffusion coefficient decrease in the cortex is a sign of modest caspase-3 activation after H-I </plain></SENT>
