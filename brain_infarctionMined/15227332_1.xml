<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neurologic complications, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>), are frequent and serious sequelae of total artificial heart (TAH) implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that occur in TAH patients are due to embolism of thrombotic fragments originating on prosthetic surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The emboli tend to lodge in the middle cerebral artery or its cortical branches and cause cortical syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are characteristically heralded by the abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a maximal neurologic deficit in an awake, often active patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> have a tendency to undergo hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is a major issue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management: In anticoagulated patients, hemorrhagic transformation often results in major neurologic worsening; therefore, this risk must be weighed against the danger of recurrent embolism in the absence of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We recommend avoiding anticoagulation during the initial 24 to 48 hours after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially in patients with large cardioembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the many invasive procedures producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> in TAH patients, combined with the large area of prosthetic surfaces, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> is a potential concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weighing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation in patients with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> is likely to produce a controversial choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation should probably be continued in such patients if they have total artificial hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The following article discusses the foregoing issues and presents recommendations for managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in TAH patients </plain></SENT>
