<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND-The use of intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) as an outcome measure in observational studies and intervention trials relies on the view that it reflects early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little knowledge concerning the relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS-We investigated the relation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> with BI and its subtypes in 470 cases and 463 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases with BI proven by MRI were consecutively recruited and classified into subtypes by cause of BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized at the same institutions and matched for age, sex, and center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was measured at the far wall of both common carotid arteries (CCA) using an automatic detection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adventitia-to-adventitia diameters and CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were measured on transverse views; lumen diameter was computed using these measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was higher in cases (0.797+/-0.006 mm) than in controls (0.735+/-0.006 mm; P&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference remained after adjustment for lumen diameter and when analyses were restricted to subjects free of previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference in CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> between cases and controls was significant in the main subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of BI increased continuously with increasing CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio per SD increase (0.150 mm) was 1.82 (95% confidence interval, 1.54 to 2.15); adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> slightly attenuated this relation (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.45 to 2.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS-An increased CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was associated with BI, both overall and in the main subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> may help select patients at high risk for BI </plain></SENT>
