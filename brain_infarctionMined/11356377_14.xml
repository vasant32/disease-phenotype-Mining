<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have described a focal embolic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic injury in two different sizes was induced by injection of two different volumes of pre-formed clots into the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were assessed at 1 and 24 h, respectively, after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was evaluated with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining at 72 h following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of gross <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was also identified on the TTC-stained brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study consisted of two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first group 10 microl of pre-formed clot was injected into <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (n=10), and in the second group 5 microl of clot was injected (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Embolizing a pre-formed clot resulted in an infarction in the territory irrigated by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Embolization with the different volume of clots resulted in different sizes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 32.1+/-2.9% (mean+/-S.E.) in the 10-microl group versus 23+/-4.5% (mean+/-S.E.) in the 5-microl group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The infarction size as well as neurological deficits correlated well with the volume of the clot injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results thus show that with the procedure described here a reliable and reproducible ischemic injury is produced in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The model is relevant to thromboembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients, and may offer a useful tool to investigate mechanisms underlying ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It may also be used to test thrombolytic agents in ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
