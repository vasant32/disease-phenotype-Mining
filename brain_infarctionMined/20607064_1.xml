<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups; one sham operation and three experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the experimental groups, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (2 h) and subsequent reperfusion (O/R) were induced with regional cerebral blood flow monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hour after MCAO/R and once daily during the experiment, the experimental group received BC while the other groups received 0.9% saline or low fat milk (LFM) orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, serum pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) levels were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was assessed by using a computerized image analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Behavioral function was also assessed using a modified neurologic severity score and corner turn test during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats receiving BC after focal brain I/R showed a significant reduction (-26%/-22%) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared to LFM/saline rats, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels were decreased significantly in rats receiving BC compared to LFM/saline rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In behavioral tests, daily BC intake showed consistent and significant improvement of neurological deficits for 7 days after MCAO/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BC ingestion after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury may prevent brain injury by reducing serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a rat model </plain></SENT>
