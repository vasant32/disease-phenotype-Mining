<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been few population based studies on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and prognosis conducted in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate, over a 2 year period, the incidence of the subtypes of first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and functional prognosis in a city located in the south of Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The period from January 2005 to December 2006 was evaluated prospectively by compiling data on first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, medications used prior to the morbidity and the incidence of traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence was adjusted for age using the direct method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored for at least 6 months following the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1323 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, 759 were first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 610 were classified as infarctions, 94 as intracerebral haemorrhage and 55 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rate per 100 000 inhabitants was 61.8 for infarction (95% CI 57.0 to 66.9), 9.5 for intracerebral haemorrhage (95% CI 7.7 to 11.6) and 5.6 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (95% CI 4.2 to 7.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30 day case fatality was 19.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> was arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> month 6, 25% had died (95% CI 21.4 to 29.1) whereas 61.5% had regained their independence (95% CI 56.2 to 68.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Case fatality rate, prognosis and incidence adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were similar to those found in other population based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> suggest that Joinville presents a mixed pattern of cardiovascular risk, a pattern seen in developed and developing countries alike </plain></SENT>
