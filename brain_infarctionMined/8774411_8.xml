<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Age matched groups of patients with a CT finding of pure leukoaraiosis (n = 26) and a control group with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT finding (n = 26) were formed (mean ages 78.6 (SD 3.3) v 76.5 (SD 4.6) years; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, central brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on CT, disability in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, gait disorder (assistance needed), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality change</z:hpo>, and night time <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> were found to be more commonly present in leuko-araiosis positive patients than in controls, whereas focal neurological symptoms and signs were not associated with leuko-araiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>-but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-were higher in the leuko-araiosis positive group than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leuko-araiosis was also found to be related to a less sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and a lower Hachinski score than true <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leuko-araiosis on CT in these elderly patients seems to be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorder</z:e> aetiologically different from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, with clinical manifestations of subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and general disabling nature and no prominent focal neurological signs or symptoms </plain></SENT>
