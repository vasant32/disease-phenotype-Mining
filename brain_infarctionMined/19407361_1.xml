<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also, analyzed the correlation between the measured levels, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the degree of neurological and the functional deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 50 patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and the control group consisted of 16 patients, age and sex matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Obtained results showed significant increase in number of leukocytes, the albumin coefficient and the level of soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules within the first seven days in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest values of measured parameters were noted within the third and the fourth day after the insult, which is the suggested period of maximal intensity of inflammatory reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation was found between measured parameters and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, the degree of neurological and the functional deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that investigated parameters in CSF and blood represent a dynamic index of inflammatory events as one of the fundametal mechanisms responsible for neuron damage during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
