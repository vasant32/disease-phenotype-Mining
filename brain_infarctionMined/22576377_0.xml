<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this hospital-based cohort study was to clarify the independent association between silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SBI) and arterial stiffness indicated by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) including the cutoff value for SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 240 consecutive patients (mean age 69 years) with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the presence of SBI, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was evaluated using baPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CCAIMT) using carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We divided patients into two groups according to the presence or absence of SBI, and compared clinical characteristics between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, increased baPWV [by 1 m/s; odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.25] was independently associated with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The baPWV cutoff value for SBI was 17.49 m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with baPWV≥17.49 m/s had a higher possibility of the presence of SBI (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.34) compared with patients with baPWV &lt;17.49 m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the adjusted OR for the presence of SBI of the combination of baPWV≥17.49 m/s and CCAIMT≥1.1 mm (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.24-6.11) was higher compared with that of baPWV≥17.49 m/s (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.11-5.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arterial stiffness is independently associated with SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measurement of baPWV can indicate the presence of SBI, especially in patients with baPWV≥17.49 m/s </plain></SENT>
