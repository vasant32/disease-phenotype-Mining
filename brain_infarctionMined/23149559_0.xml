<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coated-platelet levels are elevated in patients with nonlacunar (large-vessel) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and decreased in patients with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible relationship between coated-platelet levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assayed coated-platelet levels in 190 consecutive patients with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were followed for up to 12 months; 20 subjects experienced recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized into tertiles of coated-platelet levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distributions of time-to-recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were estimated for each tertile using cumulative incidence curves and compared statistically using a log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 12 months differed among the coated-platelet tertiles: 2% for the first tertile (lowest coated-platelet levels), 18% for the second tertile, and 17% for the third tertile (overall log-rank test, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that higher levels of coated-platelets, measured shortly after a nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, are associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation offers an additional tool for identifying patients at highest risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence following a nonlacunar (large-vessel) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 14 November 2012; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.168 </plain></SENT>
