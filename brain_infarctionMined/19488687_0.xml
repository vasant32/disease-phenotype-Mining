<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are 31 clinical reports of upside-down stomach esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo>, but the vascular system was not analyzed in any of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this specimen, most of the stomach except the pyloric region passed through the esophageal hiatus (approximately 40 mm in diameter) with the greater omentum and into the hernial sac located dorsal to the heart in the thoracic cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The greater omentum was raised on the ventral region in the hernial sac and spread toward the upper abdomen through the esophageal hiatus from the sac, without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in the abdominal cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tail of the pancreas and the spleen were located near the esophageal hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No abnormality was observed in the heart or lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> trunk and its main branches were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the left and right gastric arteries, the short gastric artery and the left gastroepiploic artery passed into the hernial sac through the esophageal hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This specimen was classified as the sliding type of esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We consider the excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> of the vertebral column to likely be associated with the formation of such a highly advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
