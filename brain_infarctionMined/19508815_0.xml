<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is limited by the cooling rate and has severe complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine if local cerebral cooling via infusion could reduce infarction volume and improve the neurological outcome in a rat model of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A hollow filament was used to block the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> for 2 hours, and then the ischemic territory was locally infused with autocirculating cold arterial blood (13-15 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This cold blood infusion (&lt;0.6 ml/min) significantly reduced the temperature of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> supplied territory to 32-34 degrees C in 5-10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hypothermic procedure was maintained for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After evaluating the neurological score at 2 days and 28 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were euthanized and their brains were sectioned and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in the brain was induced by autocirculation with a cold blood infusion, whereas the rectal temperature was maintained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume was significantly reduced and the neurological outcome was significantly improved (p&lt;0.05) after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in Group 2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>) compared with Group 1 (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) and Group 3 (normothermia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Local brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> induced by autocirculating cold arterial blood infused into ischemic tissue has neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
