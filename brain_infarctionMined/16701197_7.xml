<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 31-year-old man presented to the pain clinic with a history of cervical radicular pain and right upper-extremity radicular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was referred from the orthopedic spine clinic for evaluation for epidural steroid injection, having failed conservative treatment consisting of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51371">muscle relaxants</z:chebi>, oral steroids, and physical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After undergoing a transforaminal epidural steroid injection at the right C8 nerve root, he developed a cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270679" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He survived but has residual deficits of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> on right lateral gaze and difficulties with short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> and concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although transforaminal epidural steroid injections are an efficacious treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radicular syndromes</z:e>, there can be catastrophic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In light of the growing body of similar case reports, further investigation is warranted to establish a safe protocol for the use of this modality </plain></SENT>
