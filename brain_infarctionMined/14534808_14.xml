<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five brain CT examinations of 95 patients were displayed on Picture archiving and communications system (PACS) workstations equipped either with a dedicated medical imaging LCD colour monitor or on a high-resolution CRT which is used for routine reporting of CT, MRI and digital radiography images in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty cases were negative and 45 cases were positive for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (EBI), the latter being defined by a combination of one or more signs: dense artery; hypodensity of brain parenchyma; and local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> verified by control scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten radiologists had to rate presence or absence of EBI on a five-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ratings were evaluated by CORROC2 ROC software and areas under the ROC curve (A(z)) were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significance of differences between the two viewing conditions were evaluated with Wilcoxon test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean A(z) of the ten observers was 0.7901 with LCD vs 0.7695 with CRT which did not show statistical significance (p=0.2030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the setting investigated, reporting of CT studies from high-performance LCD monitors seems feasible without significant detriment to diagnostic performance </plain></SENT>
