<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Two patients undergoing cutaneous surgery had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo> within 1 week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients had been taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was stopped 3-7 days prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the rationale and problems associated with preoperative <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of the medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is stopped prior to surgery and restarted soon after surgery, the patient is at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it is commonly believed that continuing <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> during surgery is associated with an increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk, for cutaneous surgery, this risk is extremely low and can be easily managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> should not be discontinued prior to cutaneous surgery because of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
