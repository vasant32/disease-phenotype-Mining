<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the postprocedural hemorrhagic complications associated with stent-remodeled coil embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the database of 163 cases of stent-remodeled therapy for wide-neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, patients who showed intracranial hemorrhagic complications on follow-up brain imaging were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial presentation, antithrombotic medication, hemorrhagic type, location, amount, association with ventriculostomy, symptomatic involvement, and outcome were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients (6.1%) developed intracranial hemorrhagic complications (range; 0-422 days; mean; 56 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hemorrhagic complication rate was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (20%, 6 of 30 patients) than in patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (3%, 4 of 133 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 10 patients were on dual-antiplatelet therapy at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> developed in patients with ventriculostomies (intraparenchymal, n=4; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>, n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients who did not receive a ventriculostomy also developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n=1) or intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation in the recently infarcted brain tissue seemed to be the cause of nonventriculostomy related intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were accompanied by symptomatic aggravation in 6 of 10 cases, with 5 cases resulting in moribund clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> may be a risk of stent-remodeled therapy while the patient is on dual-antiplatelet medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Extra caution is warranted especially in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> requiring ventriculostomy or with underlying recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
