<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its main actions are <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> and vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) levels soon after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They compared plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in 30 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with those of 30 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups were adjusted for age and gender, and there were no significant differences in vascular risk factors and left ventricular systolic and diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous samples were collected within the first 11.8 +/-1.2 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and again on day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) was performed on the same days (day 0 and day 6) in order to assess the site (carotid or vertebrobasilar), cause (atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, or lacunar), and size (large, medium, or small) of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels were elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (129.9 +/-9.9 fmol/mL) compared with the controls (90.8 +/-6.3 fmol/mL, p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These levels remained elevated at day 6 (113.5 +/-13.0 fmol/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP at admission was significantly higher in cardioembolic compared with atherothrombotic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between circulating NT-proBNP and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> topography, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, or severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) at any of the 2 time points (admission and day 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels were raised in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; this effect persisted until day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that neurohumoral activation occurs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, either reflecting a counterbalancing vasodilating response to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or direct myocardial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
