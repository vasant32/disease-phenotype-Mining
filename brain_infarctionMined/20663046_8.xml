<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation and decreased the risk of hemorrhagic transformation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we investigate the possible involvement of the plasminogen/plasmin system and endogenous MMPs inhibitor underlying the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-mediated MMP-9 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to 1-hr <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 48-hr reperfusion of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or vehicle was intravenously injected upon reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> and hemorrhagic transformation were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracellular matrix damage was determined by Western immunoblot analysis for laminin protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The activity and expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by gelatin zymography, in situ zymography, and Western immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the activities of tissue and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) were evaluated by plasminogen-dependent casein zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP-1) were investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western immunoblot analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion induced increased MMP-9 activity and expression at 12-48 hr after reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated animals had significantly decreased MMP-9 activity and expression (P&lt;0.05), in addition to reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and hemorrhagic transformation as well as improved laminin protein preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-mediated MMP-9 inhibition was accompanied by reduced uPA activity (P&lt;0.05), as well as increased TIMP-1 expression and PAI activity (P&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>'s pluripotent mechanisms for attenuating postischemic MMP-9 activation and neurovascular damage, and further support it as an add-on to thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
