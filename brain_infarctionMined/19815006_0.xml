<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was whether free radicals contribute to the pathogenesis of the lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to investigate the day after hospitalization, the concentrations of 3-nitrotyrosine and tyrosine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects included 20 living patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale score was used to assess the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including that the patients were mild cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no expansion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion in the brain, as assessed by CT on the day following admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration of 3-nitrotyrosine was significantly higher in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the concentration of tyrosine did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the 3-nitrotyrosine/tyrosine ratio was significantly higher in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that free radicals are produced in the CSF of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and that nitration of neuronal proteines is enhanced under this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These obsetvations suggest that lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients should be treated with edaravon, which is a free radical scavenger usually prescribed for cases of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, as it will likely improve the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
