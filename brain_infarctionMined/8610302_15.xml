<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical trials of new drugs that reverse neurological deficits when used in the first hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> suggest that early hospital admission is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a database of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to determine the factors that delay hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during 1993 in the province of Central Finland (population, 256 000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients referred to the Central Hospital, the only tertiary referral hospital in the area, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 363 (79%) were admitted to the Central Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was confirmed in 356 (98%) patients with CT scan, and the patient population included 272 (75%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 51 (14%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 40 (11%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important factor associated with a delay in reaching the hospital was the referral pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median delay was 2 hours for patients brought directly to the Central Hospital, 8 hours if a physician at the local health center was consulted, and 47 hours if the patient was first admitted to the health center for observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other factors associated with a delay were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the evening or night or during the weekend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who are candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials arrive at the hospital after prolonged delays for multiple reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Public and medical personnel education could result in signficant reduction in these delays </plain></SENT>
