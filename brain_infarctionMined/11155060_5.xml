<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebellomedullary fissure approach is enjoying increasing application as a technique for exposure of the fourth ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> that arises in the quadrigeminal plate or the superior vermis grows to fill the fourth ventricle, and for such a case a combination of the infratentorial supracerebellar approach and the cerebellomedullary fissure approach might be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a grave hazard of this combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> involving the superior vermis and filling the fourth ventricle were managed with a combined infratentorial supracerebellar/cerebellomedullary fissure approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first patient, who underwent a bilateral exposure, died on the sixth postoperative day due to massive hemorrhagic venous infarction of the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second patient, who was explored on one side only, suffered a protracted postoperative course characterized by suboccipital pain, torticollis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo> and persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative imaging showed swelling of the inferior vermis and ipsilateral hemisphere of the cerebellum with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous compromise of the galenic and tentorial bridging veins and interruption of collateral pathways between these systems and the petrosal bridging veins, as in the combined infratentorial supracerebellar/cerebellomedullary fissure approach, may cause cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> with venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and possible venous infarction </plain></SENT>
