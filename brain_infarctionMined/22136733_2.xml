<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the use of a self-expanding stent as a thrombectomy device in 17 patients (mean age 64.3 years) with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> secondary to large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients had a mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score of &gt;12, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or early infarction signs that affected more than 1/3 of the endangered territory, and an insufficient collateral supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 8 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a stent (Solitaire; ev3, Irvine, CA, USA) was deployed across the occluded segment (endovascular bypass step) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A repeat angiogram was performed to evaluate reconstituted flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The guide-catheter balloon was inflated for proximal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The partially deployed stent was slowly pulled back (mechanical thrombectomy step) under continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization (TIMI grade 3 flow) was achieved in fewer than 66 minutes after femoral access in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with complete clot removal in a mean of two thrombectomy attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No stent was permanently implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (11.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented post-recanalization parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (11.8%); one suffered an intracerebral and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> 12 hours after a successful and uneventful procedure and died 10 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin Scale scores were 0 to 2 in 15 patients (88.2%) and 3 in one patient (5.9%) at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our preliminary experience, rapid stent-based mechanical thrombectomy has had unprecedented success </plain></SENT>
