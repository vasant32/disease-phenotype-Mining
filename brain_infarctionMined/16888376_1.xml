<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hundred and fifty-one consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt;12 h) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who received intracranial CTA were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity on admission was determined using the National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reconstructed CTAs were investigated for relevant pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging was performed 24-48 h after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed after 3 months using the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single factor and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to predict infarction and dependency (modified Rankin scale &gt; or = 3) on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median NIHSS on admission was 10 (IQR 3-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of the 151 patients, 61 (40%) had pathological CTA findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infarction was demonstrated in 60/61 patients (98%) with and in 67/90 patients (74%) without vessel pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presence of infarction on follow-up imaging and dependency at 3 months were correlated with pathological CTA findings on admission in single factor analysis (each p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age (&gt; or =/&lt;65 years), NIHSS (&gt; or =/&lt;10), sex, therapy, and time to presentation (&gt; or =/&lt;3 h), only NIHSS &gt; or = 10 on admission was predictive of dependency at follow-up (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pathological CTA findings in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> do not independently predict a poor outcome at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
