<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of such vessels are resulted from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> based on atherosclerotic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, we occasionally encounter a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> seemed to be caused by embolic mechanism, as who has had previous experience of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or presented with clinical symptoms suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has high accuracy for depicting small ischemic lesions and discrimination of recent infarctions from old ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied frequency, risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism in the territory of penetrating arteries detected on DWI, and sensitivity of ischemic lesions by DWI as compared with conventional MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in the territory of penetrating arteries who admitted to our hospital and were studied by DWI within 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine (17.0%) of 53 patients had multiple high signal lesions on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These lesions were found in single arterial territory in 4 patients and in more than 2 territories in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was presumed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were artery to artery or cardiogenic embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DWI revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 38 hyperintensity lesions, while conventional MRI revealed 35 lesions, although the latter was resulted from retrospectively referring to the DWI finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, conventional MRI alone might have been difficult to detect multiple lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DWI was enable to distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> from small vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, leading to feasible patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, DWI should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, even if neurological finding is correspondent with the conventional MRI finding </plain></SENT>
