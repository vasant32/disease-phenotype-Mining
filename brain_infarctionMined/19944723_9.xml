<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing provides a powerful strategy for modulating specific gene functions, difficulties associated with siRNA delivery have impeded the development of efficient therapeutic applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the efficacy of siRNA delivery into neurons has been limited by extremely low transfection efficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R is a biodegradable arginine <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53199">PAMAM</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51338">dendrimer</z:chebi>, which is readily degradable under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of siRNA delivery by e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R in primary cortical cultures and in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R/siRNA complexes showed high transfection efficiencies and low cytotoxicities in primary cortical cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Localization of fluorescence-tagged siRNA revealed that siRNA was delivered not only into the nucleus and cytoplasm, but also along the processes of the neuron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R/siRNA complex-mediated target gene reduction was observed in over 40% of cells and it was persistent for over 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The potential use of e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R was demonstrated by gene knockdown after transfecting High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1, a novel cytokine-like molecule) siRNA into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-treated primary cortical cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these cells, HMGB1 siRNA delivery successfully reduced both basal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced HMGB1 levels, and as a result of that, neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly suppressed in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed that e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R successfully delivered HMGB1 siRNA into the rat brain, wherein HMGB1 expression was depleted in over 40% of neurons and astrocytes of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R-mediated HMGB1 siRNA delivery notably reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in the postischemic rat brain, which is generated by occluding the middle cerebral artery for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="51135">PAM</z:chebi>-R, a novel biodegradable nonviral gene carrier, offers an efficient means of transfecting siRNA into primary neuronal cells and in the brain and of performing siRNA-mediated gene knockdown </plain></SENT>
