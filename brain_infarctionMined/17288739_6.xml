<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male, Wistar rats (n=12) underwent transient middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion for 3 hours followed by 3 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, four rats each were subcutaneously injected with either 20 or 40 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of 3 hours of reperfusion, tissue injury and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) opening were quantified by histology and [(14)C]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27971">alpha-aminoisobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="165" ids="27971">AIB</z:chebi>)-based quantitative autoradiography (QAR), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with untreated rats, those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) had reduced volumes of <z:chebi fb="165" ids="27971">AIB</z:chebi> leakage, tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> and distribution space for <z:chebi fb="165" ids="27971">AIB</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No additional effects were seen with the higher drug dose (40 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> are in part owing to attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability </plain></SENT>
