<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is a major vessel responsible for the blood supply to the interhemispheric region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ACA segment after the anterior communicating artery (AComA) origin is called the distal ACA and has central and cortical branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cortical branches are distributed in the different regions of the orbital and medial part of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objects of this study are the anatomical variations found in the distal ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 76 hemispheres the ACA distal branches were injected with latex and dissected under microscope magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameters and distances between vessel origins and anterior communicating artery were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microsurgical dissection was carried out to demonstrate anatomic variations of these vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average diameter of ACA at origin was 2.61 +/- 0.34 mm and average diameter of cortical branches diameter ranged from 0.79 +/- 0.27 mm to 1.84 +/- 0.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distances between vessel origin and AComA ranged from 7.68 +/- 3.91 mm (orbitofrontal) to 112.6 +/- 11.63 mm (inferior internal parietal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study found anatomical variations: a single (azygos) ACA was present in one case and three in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Crossing branches of the distal ACA to the contralateral hemisphere were present in 26% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In some cases a single ACA may supply the posterior hemispheric region through crossing branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This calls attention to potential bilateral brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> due to a single unilateral ACA occlusion </plain></SENT>
