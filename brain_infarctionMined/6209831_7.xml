<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six cases of completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the middle cerebral artery territory of more than two months' duration were selected for this study of neuropathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coronal brain slices of the entire brain were cut for histology and stained with Kl√ºver-Barrera's stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuronal and glial cell density, and cortex thickness were measured at various distances from the border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding counting points in the contralateral hemisphere served as control in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of histologically intact neurons was in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at a distance of 0.5 cm or more from the border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one half of the cases the border zone between infarcted and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue was less than a few cells in thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study of old brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> confirms the commonly held view that there is an abrupt transition between infarcted and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the wide zone of low blood flow and metabolism surrounding cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is not caused by selective loss of neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Instead, we hypothesize that such change in blood flow and metabolism is the result of neuronal disconnection and cortical deactivation </plain></SENT>
