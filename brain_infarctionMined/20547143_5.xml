<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated whether bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) transduced with the EPO gene (EPO-MSCs) promoted neural cell survival and improved neurological deficits caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EPO-MSCs stably produced high levels of EPO (10IU/ml) without any alteration of their mesenchymal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both EPO transduction and treatment with 10 international units (IU) of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) provided protection from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced oxidative injury in human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells and in SH-SY5Y cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EPO-MSCs were more protected than were MSCs treated with 10IU rhEPO (10U-MSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that the expression of the neurotrophic factors BDNF, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-ECGF, HGF, SDF-1alpha, and TGF-1beta increased in EPO-MSCs, while only BDNF and TGF-1beta increased in 10U-MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Implantation of EPO-MSCs in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> significantly improved neurological function and decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes without affecting hematocrit level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of the brain tissue 21days after implantation showed that EPO and phosphorylated Akt (a downstream mediator of EPO) increased only in brains implanted with EPO-MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transduction of the EPO gene into MSCs induced secretion of EPO and various trophic factors that may provide excellent neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
