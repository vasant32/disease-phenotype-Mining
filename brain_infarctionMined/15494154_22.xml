<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present work examined the hypothesis that brain ischemic tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning (<z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) is triggered by an initial <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and is associated with an increase in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities as one end-effector of the neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were preconditioned by a single 3-min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a various duration of reperfusion (30 min, 24, 72 or 168 h), rats were subjected to a 60-min focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and sacrificed 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were significantly reduced when performed during the 24- to 72-h time window after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min prior to <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>), completely suppressed the neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The free radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU; 300 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min prior to <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> ebselen (10 mg/kg, oral cramming, 2 h before and 12 h after <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>) also abolished the <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>-induced protection of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi> did not induce any delayed changes in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, glutathion peroxidase) activities nor in the neuronal expression of Mn and Cu/Zn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that an initial <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> could be involved as a trigger of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="53004">IPC</z:chebi>, while <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes do not play a key role as end-effectors in such a neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
