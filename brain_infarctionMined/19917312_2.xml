<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different behavioral assays have been used to evaluate the severity of lesions or recovery after treatment in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the correlation between the size of infarction and locomotor activity after transient MCAo in adult Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 30-90-min by ligation with a 10-O suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 2 days after MCAo, animals were individually placed in a 3-D infrared activity chamber for 1h to measure their horizontal, vertical, stereotypic and rotational activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body asymmetry was examined using an elevated body swing test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volume of infarction was measured by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that there is a significant correlation between the volume of infarction and vertical movement, such as vertical activity, vertical movement number and vertical movement time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is also a significant correlation between the infarction volume and body asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that vertical locomotor activity and body asymmetry are useful behavioral indices to estimate the size of lesioning in rodents after MCAo </plain></SENT>
