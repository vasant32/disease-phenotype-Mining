<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients with a partial oculomotor palsy because of a localized infarction or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001488'>bilateral ptosis</z:hpo>, impaired adduction, and supraduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had impaired infraduction and pupillary involvement on one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed discrete lesions at the dorsal midbrain tegmentum that spared the rostral midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors' cases elucidate that pupillary components take the most rostral course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report provides indirect magnetic resonance imaging evidence to prove the course of pupillary fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the different neuro-ophthalmologic findings in the authors' cases (sparing or affecting pupillary component and infraduction), the nerves of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique for infraduction pass more rostrally than those of medial rectus, superior rectus, and levator palpebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nuclear and fascicular arrangement within the midbrain oculomotor nerve is speculated to be pupillary, extraocular, and eyelid elevation in the rostro-caudal order, based on the neuro-ophthalmologic impairment and magnetic resonance imaging findings in the authors' patients and in previous animal experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Knowing the fascicular and nuclear arrangement within the midbrain in detail will offer diagnostic clues for differentiation of causes for partial oculomotor palsy </plain></SENT>
