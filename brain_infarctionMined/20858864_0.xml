<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>Patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> through paradoxical embolization to the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the relationship between the morphological and functional size of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> by echocardiography compared with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume identified on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients who were referred to interventional cardiology with the diagnosis of cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were included and had either a transesophageal echocardiogram or an intracardiac echo and a brain MRI at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiogram or intracardiac echo was used to obtain <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI of the brain with 3 sequences (T2, diffusion-weighted imaging, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) was used to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and measure the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 72 patients studied, the median measured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume was 4.3 cm(3) on diffusion-weighted imaging, 4.1 cm(3) on T2, and 3.5 cm(3) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> height, length, septum secundum thickness, or echo bubble grade and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume measured from the 3 MRI sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between septal excursion distance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r=0.35; P=0.005), but the 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> did not have the largest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This analysis revealed that septal excursion distance correlates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> size by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, smaller <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> size without the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> may still be associated with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> height, length by echo, or shunt grade by transcranial Doppler study and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> size or <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> should not be the only criteria to decide whether a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> should be closed </plain></SENT>
