<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the methods of evaluating brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> accurately and objectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Various kinds of clinical examination [including conscious state, Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> score (GCS), brain stem reflection, cranial nerve dominated actions, spinal reflection, spinal nerve dominated automatic action, respiratory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> testing] and laboratory methods [such as electroencephalography (EEG), brainstem auditory evoked potentral (BAEP), brainstem auditory sensery evoked potentral (SLSEP) and transeranial Doppler (TCD)] were used to evaluate 11 cases with brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven cases presenting with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> were conssedered to have brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had GCS score of 3 and disappearance of brain stem reflection and cranial nerve dominated automatic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of them patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0009916'>anisocoria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of them pharyngeal reflex could not be detected because of tracheal cannulization, but this did not influence the evaluation of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of them showed "flat" EEG and disappearience of BAEP dominant wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the SLSEP show any wave behind N13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCD showed blood stream characteristic of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> except in one case blood stream characteristic of increased intracraniai pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>Apnea</z:hpo> test and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> test provided the final proof brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The former had more influence on heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation while the latter were more safe and reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined and continuous observation of clinical and laboratory indices can enhance the accuracy of the evaluation of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
