<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aged SD male rats, weighing 200-300 g, were randomly divided into 4 groups: the model group, the sham-operative group, the nimodipine positive control group (abbreviated as nimodipine group) and the SFI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injured rat model was established by modified Longa method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SFI was administered by intravenous dripping 1 week before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>Nervous</z:mp> function disorder, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> area, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) levels, brain contents of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> , water, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and SOD levels were observed 3 hrs after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 3 hrs after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: perimental results showed that SFI could obviously improve the deficit of nerve function, decrease water content of brain, reduce the infarction area of brain, and inhibit Ca2 + aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LDH and CK levels in serum and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in brain were obviously lower than those in the model group and SOD activity in cerebral tissue was obviously higher than that in the model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SFI had protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion injured aged rats, whose mechanism might be related to the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> aggregation </plain></SENT>
