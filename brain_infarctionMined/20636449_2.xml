<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with expansive bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> and decreased level of consciousness were operated with suboccipital craniectomy, removal of the infarcted tissue, and placement of external ventricular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GCS) score before surgery was 8.9 ± 3.3 and improved to 12.6 ± 3.6 at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the long-term follow-up (median 57.6 months), six patients had a favorable outcome (mRS 1.3 ± 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with an associated brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, surgical treatment resulted in a favorable clinical outcome and should be considered a treatment option for patients with expansive bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
