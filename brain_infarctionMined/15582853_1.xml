<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the lateralization of lesions among a previously reported series of 51 patients with three kinds of destructive lesions based on their topography: specific arterial territory (AT), arterial borderzone territory (Bdz), hemispheric (H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from group Bdz) had bilateral nonlateralizing lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distributions of left- and right-sided lesions were distinct among the groups (P=0.014): in group H, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one presented with right-sided lesions (89%); in group Bdz, left-sided lesions (53%) were more frequent than right-sided lesions (17.7%); in group AT, left- and right-sided lesions were more equally distributed (56 and 44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that there is a trend toward lesion lateralization among patients with different patterns of precocious destructive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in cerebral maturation and vulnerability between the hemispheres is a possible factor explaining lesion lateralization in early life insults </plain></SENT>
