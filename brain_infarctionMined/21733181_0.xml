<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was performed to determine whether injury induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> could be further improved by transplantation with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) modified by Survivin (SVV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MSCs derived from bone marrow of male Sprague-Dawley rats were infected by the self-inactive lentiviral vector GCFU carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and SVV recombinant vector (GCFU-SVV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were detected in infected MSCs supernatants under hypoxic conditions by ELSIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, experiments consisted of three groups, one receiving intravenous injection of 500 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without cells (control group) and two groups administered the same volume solution with either three million GFP-MSCs (group GFP) or SVV/GFP-MSCs (group SVV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were submitted to 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and then reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differentiation and survival of the transplanted MSCs were determined by confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot was used to detect the expression of VEGF and bFGF in ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining was used to assess the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of neurological function was performed using a modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, modification with SVV further increased secretion of VEGF and bFGF under hypoxic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vivo, only very few transplantated cells co-expressed GFP and NeuN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The survival transplanted cells in the group SVV was 1.3-fold at 4 days after transplantation and 3.4-fold higher at 14 days after transplantation, respectively, when compared with group GFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Expression of VEGF and bFGF in the ischemic tissue were further up-regulated by modification with SVV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, modification with SVV further reduced the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 5.2% at 4 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and improved post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurological function at 14 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Modification with SVV could further enhance the therapeutic effects of MSCs possibly through improving the MSCs survival capacity and up-regulating the expression of protective cytokines in the ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
