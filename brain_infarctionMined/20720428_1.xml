<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND PATIENTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of 500 patients with whiplash injury acquired in car accidents between 1996 and 2005 and searched for dissections of cervical arteries occurring within 12 months after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight cases of cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> occurred within 12 months following whiplash injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 7 cases (87.5%), the dissection was complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of posttraumatic dissections after whiplash injuries was much higher than the overall incidence of cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> in the general population (1.6 vs. 0.0041%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of cerebrovascular events was still increased 4-12 months after whiplash injury (0.6 vs. 0.003075% in the general population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of posttraumatic dissection and cerebrovascular events within 12 months after whiplash injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Car accident is an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The victims of car accidents should be screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study should be more thoroughly investigated in a prospective trial of car accident victims as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
