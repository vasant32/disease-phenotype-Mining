<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Smoking, increased fibrinogen levels, and platelet activation are related to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The platelet fibrinogen receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (Gp) IIb/IIIa Pl(A1/A2) polymorphism affects the binding of platelets to fibrinogen and is suggested to interact with smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We explored the association of smoking and the Pl(A1/A2) polymorphism with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and survival in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Aging Memory cohort, comprising 486 consecutive patients (55 to 85 years old) who were analyzed 3 months after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and followed up for 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtype determined by magnetic resonance imaging and GpIIb/IIIa Pl(A1/A2) genotype data were available for 272 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, smoking was the only factor related to the risk of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio [OR]=1.87, 95% CI=1.05 to 3.31; P=0.033), and it was also a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n=24, 8.8%) at 15 months (OR=5.13, 95% CI=1.61 to 16.36; P=0.006), along with age (OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.01 to 1.19; P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GpIIb/IIIa Pl(A1/A2) polymorphism alone showed no association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was a smoking-by-genotype association with the risk of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR=2.10, 95% CI=0.90 to 4.89; P=0.087) and with survival (OR=2.78, 95% CI=0.89 to 8.61; P=0.077) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among younger (55 to 69 years) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, smokers carrying the Pl(A2) allele were at a higher (OR=5.81, 95% CI=1.26 to 26.80; P=0.024) risk of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than noncarrier smokers (OR=3.12, 95% CI=1.06 to 9.24; P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of Pl(A2) and smoking combined on survival was also stronger (OR=8.86, 95% CI=1.68 to 46.55; P=0.010) than the effect of smoking alone (OR=5.06, 95% CI=1.20 to 21.35; P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that prothrombotic genetic factors may interact with smoking by modifying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotype and affecting midterm survival </plain></SENT>
