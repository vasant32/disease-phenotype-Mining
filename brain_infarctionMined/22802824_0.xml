<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hyperdensity of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) on unenhanced CT is a recognized sign associated with brain's early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of studies which showed a hyperdense posterior cerebral artery (HPCA) sign in posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is relatively small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of the HPCA sign, correlations with ischemic lesion volume, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined the association with prothrombotic and inflammatory markers which have not been studied before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: In the group of 376 patients with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> consecutively admitted to Emergency Department, early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were visible in 221 (58%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty five (25%) subjects had ischemic lesions in the brain supplied by the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the unenhanced CT scans, calculated the density of the posterior cerebral arteries, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and assessed the relation of the HPCA sign to other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HPCA sign appeared on CT scans of 12 (22%) patients with evidence of the posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The density (in Hounsfield units) of the affected <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> was 46.5 comparing to 20.2 of an intact vessel (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume was larger when the HPCA sign was observed (medians: 17.6 vs. 4.3 cm(3), p=0.02); in multivariate analysis this association was still significant (OR=1.07; 95% CI, 0.99-1.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher (p=0.02 for both factors) in patients with the HPCA sign in the univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HPCA may be considered as an additional marker of early brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, especially with large lesion volume </plain></SENT>
