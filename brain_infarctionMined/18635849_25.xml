<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral white matter lesions and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are small vessel disease-related lesions, which are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the relationship between risk factors, effect modifiers, and progression of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we studied the cognitive consequences of lesion progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six hundred sixty-eight people, aged 60 to 90 years, underwent repeated MRI scanning and neuropsychological testing within 3-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We rated incident lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and change in periventricular and subcortical white matter lesion severity with a semiquantitative scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relationships between age, sex, baseline lesion load, risk factors, lesion progression, and change in cognitive function by multivariate regression analyses and additional stratified analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline lesion load, higher age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, and current smoking were independently associated with progression of white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women had more marked progression of subcortical white matter lesions and incident lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was associated with incident lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher blood pressure did not contribute to lesion progression in people with already severe lesions at baseline nor in the very old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesion progression was associated with a paralleled decline in general cognitive function and in particular with a decreased information processing speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, female sex, cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure, and baseline lesion load were associated with small vessel disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age and baseline lesion load influenced the risk relations with blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Progression of small vessel disease was related to a paralleled decline in cognitive function </plain></SENT>
