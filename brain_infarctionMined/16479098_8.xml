<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There have not been many discussions on the differences between the guidelines for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> used in eastern and western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper was to examine whether or not there are substantial differences between western countries and Japan in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, as well as in the recommended therapy for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although there are racial differences and differences in approved drugs between the East and West, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes tend to converge throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> is still different between the East and West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of various countries' guidelines shows that recommendations on antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are fundamentally similar in the East and West, but the recommended doses of antiplatelets, especially aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, are smaller in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Japanese guidelines only recommend the use of antiplatelets (particularly cilostazol) for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> with evidence </plain></SENT>
