<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective of the current study was to investigate the cause-effect relationship of activated leukocytes for the development of ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mongolian gerbils were subjected to 15 min of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cranial window was implanted for quantitative analysis of the pial microcirculation focusing on leukocyte-endothelium interactions by intravital fluorescence microscopy up to 3 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently the animals were daily screened for neurological deficits and the evolving brain damage was assessed histologically after 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> the number of rolling and adherent leukocytes increased 20- and &gt;23-fold, respectively upon 3 h of reperfusion as compared to controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic animals developed neurological deficits and showed a significant loss of neurons in selective vulnerable areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of leukocyte activation, i.e. the maximum number of rollers and stickers directly correlated to the number of viable neurons on day 4 in hippocampus, cortex, and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there is a relationship between activation of leukocyte-endothelium interactions and the reduction of ischemic brain damage after global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of leukocytes may have neuroprotective potential or indicate regenerative processes </plain></SENT>
