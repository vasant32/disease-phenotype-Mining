<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) has been established, efficacy of antiplatelet therapy for low-risk patients is disputable in Japanese patients because of the frequent hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the efficacy and safety of aspirin therapy in Japanese patients with NVAF in a prospective randomized multicenter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with NVAF were randomized to an aspirin group (aspirin at 150 to 200 mg per day) or a control group without antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end points included cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 426 patients were randomized to aspirin group and 445 to no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The trial was stopped earlier because there were 27 primary end point events (3.1% per year; 95% CI, 2.1% to 4.6% per year) in the aspirin group versus 23 (2.4% per year; 95% CI, 1.5% to 3.5% per year) in the control group, suggesting a low possibility of superiority of the aspirin treatment for prevention of the primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with aspirin caused a marginally increased risk of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (7 patients; 1.6%) compared with the control group (2 patients; 0.4%; Fisher exact test P=0.101) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with NVAF, aspirin at 150 to 200 mg per day does not seem to be either effective or safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are needed to determine the best preventive therapy for cerebrovascular events in Japanese patients with NVAF </plain></SENT>
