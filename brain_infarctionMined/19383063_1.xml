<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the factors of interest were associated with SBI is investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and forty-two subjects with a mean age of 52.1 +/- 13.1 years (21-87 years) without any history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> were enrolled in this cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and blood chemistry determinations </plain></SENT>
