<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the severity and location of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are correlated with the signs of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular abnormalities in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 4,176 men and women (mean age, 76 years) who participated in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> images of both dilated eyes were taken and evaluated for the presence of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> focal arteriolar signs (focal arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> lesions (<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blot <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysms</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired and evaluated for the presence and distribution of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic and multinomial logistic models were constructed to estimate the association of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvascular signs to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Controlling for demographic and major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, we found that <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> focal arteriolar signs, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> lesions, were significantly associated with an increasing load of subcortical and periventricular WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strongest association was found between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar signs and a heavier WMH load, specifically in the subcortical frontal lobe, and periventricular frontal and parietal caps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency toward bilateral <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> focal arteriolar narrowing being more strongly associated with the heavier load of subcortical WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arteriovenous nicking was significantly associated with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In older adults, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> focal arteriolar signs, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> lesions, are correlated with the load of diffuse WMHs, particularly those located in the subcortical frontal lobe, and the periventricular frontal and parietal caps of the brain </plain></SENT>
