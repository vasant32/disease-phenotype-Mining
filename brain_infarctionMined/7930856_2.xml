<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An investigation of the feasibility and validity of measurement of the conjunctival oxygen tension as a monitor of peripheral circulation, blood and extracellular fluid volume and cerebral circulation was carried out in 7 healthy volunteers and 5 unconscious critical care patients with proven total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The healthy volunteers were subjected to changes in hydration achieved by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> and subsequent rehydration by administration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conjunctival oxygen tension was found to be a sensitive indicator of changes in the degree of hydration presumably by its ability to detect changes in peripheral circulation depending upon circulating blood and extracellular fluid volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A drawback is that other stimuli of the sympatho-adrenergic system such as temperature and pain, interfere with measurement in the conscious volunteer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with presumed total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> the conjunctival <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> cannot be used as a reliable monitor of cerebral blood flow because of varying perfusion of the palpebral conjunctiva from the external carotid artery in the occasional patient </plain></SENT>
