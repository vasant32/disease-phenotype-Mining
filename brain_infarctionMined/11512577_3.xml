<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a powerful method for discriminating new from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This can be done on the diffusion-weighted images provided that b is sufficiently high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine that critical value of b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed DWI from a previous study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, mainly lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and selected 18 old lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, well defined on uncoded images with b 0 s/m2 (i. e., T2-weighted images) but invisible on DWI with b 1,200 x 10(6) s/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a 1.5 tesla imager and single-shot echo-planar technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We had seven separate acquisitions with echo time 123 ms and b in steps between 0 and 1,200 x 10(6) s/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists blinded to the selection of lesions carried out two different lesion-detection procedures, thereby testing each lesion four times, giving a total of 72 tests of b values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were consistent, indicating a level for detection of 800 x 10(6) s/m2 in two tests, 400-600 x 10(6) s/m2 in 65 tests and at lower values in the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For imagers up to 1.5 tesla, at long repetition times and an echo time up to 120 ms T2-shine through of old lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be avoided using b of 1,000 x 10(6) s/m2 </plain></SENT>
