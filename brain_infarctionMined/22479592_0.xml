<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To overcome ER stress, unfolded proteins are eliminated by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the physiological requirements for ERAD-related membrane proteins in mammals, we generated Derlin-1-, Derlin-3-, and Herp-deficient mice by gene targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete loss of Derlin-1 caused <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> at around E7-E8 (early somite stages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Derlin-3- and Herp-deficient mice were born alive with the expected Mendelian frequency, and were superficially indistinguishable from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the Derlin-3- and Herp-deficient mouse organs, the expression levels of ERAD-related proteins were affected under both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ER stress conditions; specific effects differed among the organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degradation of ERAD substrates was reduced in the Herp-deficient liver, and Herp-deficient mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and vulnerability to brain ischemic injury, both of which are known to be implicated in ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that ERAD or uncharacterized functions involving Derlin-1 are essential in early embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Derlin-3- and Herp-deficient mice may become useful model animals for investigations of the physiological contribution of ERAD under stressful or pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
