<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the nature of their interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro: a primary co-culture of neuronal and glial cells derived from neonatal mice was exposed to oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) and the resulting neuronal injury was assessed by the release of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo: Postnatal rats aged 7 days underwent right common carotid artery ligation followed by 90 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of infarction was assessed at four days post-injury by morphological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term neurological function was evaluated at 30 days post-injury by testing co-ordination on rotarod </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> and Dex concentration-dependently reduced LDH release with IC50 values of 42% atm (95% CI: 35-52) and 0.10 microM (95% CI: 0.08-0.16), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isobolographic analysis showed that combined effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> and Dex in vitro was additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, a combination of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> and Dex, at doses that are individually not neuroprotective, produced significant neuroprotective effect as measured by reduction in area of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term neurological function data corroborated these morphological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that the combination of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> and Dex offers neuroprotection additively in vitro and synergistically in vivo </plain></SENT>
