<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine long-term trends in the incidence, lifetime risk, severity, and 30-day mortality of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective evaluation of the community-based Framingham Study original and offspring cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were 9152 men and women free of prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and undergoing follow-up for up to 50 years over 3 consecutive periods (1950-1977, 1978-1989, and 1990-2004), with biennial ascertainment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor data and active surveillance for incident clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cause-specific mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence (age-adjusted, sex-specific), severity, 30-day mortality, and mortality-adjusted 10-year and lifetime risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in each of the specified periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1030 incident clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (450 [44%] in men, 629 atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> [61%]) in 9152 persons 55 years or older over 174,917 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence of first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> per 1000 person-years in each of the 3 periods was 7.6, 6.2, and 5.3, respectively, in men (P = .02 for trend) and 6.2, 5.8, and 5.1 in women (P = .01 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lifetime risk at age 65 years decreased from 19.5% to 14.5% in men (P = .11) and from 18.0% to 16.1% in women (P = .61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity did not vary across periods; however, 30-day mortality decreased significantly in men (from 23% to 14%; P = .01) but not significantly in women (from 21% to 20%; P = .32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of men and women free of prevalent clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at initial examination, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has decreased over the past 50 years but the lifetime risk has not declined to the same degree, perhaps due to improved life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that improved control of risk factors has lowered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence but emphasize the need for continued primary prevention efforts </plain></SENT>
