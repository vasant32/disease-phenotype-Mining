<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to describe the main cranial CT findings from a retrospective review of six patients (four men and two women, 18-66 years old) afflicted with disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by S. prolificans with neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were severely neutropenic and presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> and conscience deterioration, with a subsequent 100% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis was established by autopsy (performed in five patients) and blood culture findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cranial CT showed multiple low-density lesions in four patients without contrast enhancement located in the basal ganglia and corticomedullary junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy findings of these lesions demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and hyphae proliferation inside brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, two of the patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, but angiography could not be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT and autopsy findings were fairly similar to those encountered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral aspergillosis</z:e>; however, possibly because of its rapid and fatal evolution, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or ring enhancing lesions were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, Scedosporium can be included as a rare but possible cause of invasive fungal disseminated central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in severely neutropenic patients </plain></SENT>
