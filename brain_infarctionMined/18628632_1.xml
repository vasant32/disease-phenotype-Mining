<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients with a supratentorial lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, who were admitted within 48 h, were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Progressive-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (PS) was defined as progressive motor deficits that arose within 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, by using the motor ratings of the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients (26%) were classified into the PS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the PS group, fluctuating or progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (81 vs. 42%, p = 0.009), leg-predominant motor deficits on admission (63 vs. 16%, p = 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata lesion on diffusion-weighted MRI (100 vs. 69%, p = 0.013) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> more frequent than in the non-PS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bedside neurological assessment and MRI findings may allow us to predict PS and start early intensive treatment for preventing further neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
