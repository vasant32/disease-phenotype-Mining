<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical characteristics and long-term outcome are poorly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a single-center assessment of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cohort comprises 874 consecutive patients from the Helsinki <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Thrombolysis Registry, out of whom 113 scored 0 on 24-hour NIHSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed their baseline demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics and 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between the study parameters were tested by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a 24-hour NIHSS score = 0 (n = 113) were younger than the rest of the population (n = 761; median: 65.6 vs. 71.5 years; p &lt; 0.001), their NIHSS score on admission was lower (median: 5 vs. 10; p &lt; 0.001), as was their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (median: 6.2 vs. 6.7 mmol/l; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-treatment time was similar in both groups (median: 120 vs. 115 min; p = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a 24-hour NIHSS score = 0 more often achieved an excellent outcome (mRS scores: 0-1; 81 vs. 31%; p &lt; 0.001) and had lower mortality (1.8 vs. 11.8%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One third of these patients had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> visible on 24-hour imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower baseline NIHSS score and younger age were independently associated with 24-hour NIHSS score = 0, which, in turn, was independently associated with excellent 3-month outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an NIHSS score = 0 at 24 h following thrombolysis are younger, have milder symptoms and have a lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They achieve more often excellent outcome and lower mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Still, 8% of them required help in daily activities or were dead at 3 months (mRS scores: 3-6) </plain></SENT>
