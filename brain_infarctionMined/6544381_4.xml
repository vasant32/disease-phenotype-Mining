<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time interval between examination and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> varied from one day to six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were clearly detected by the T1 weighted inversion recovery sequence but the tissue contrast was better using the spin echo sequence with a long repetition rate and a long echo delay (SE2000/100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients the brain stem lesions were invisible with CT, but were easily depicted with NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of them the further progress of the lesion was also confirmed and visualized with the follow-up NMR study </plain></SENT>
