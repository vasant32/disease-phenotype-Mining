<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1, a cytokine shown to amelioriate <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp>, in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An autologous clot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was introduced intracranially through the right internal carotid artery in 21 New Zealand White rabbits, with seven in each group receiving either vehicle control (albumin) or 10 or 50 micrograms transforming growth factor-beta 1 administered as an intracarotid bolus immediately before autologous clot embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple physiological parameters were monitored, including regional cerebral blood flow, arterial blood gases, hematocrit, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, core temperature, and mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain was harvested 4 hours after embolization, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined planimetrically as a percentage of the entire hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was reduced in both the 10-microgram (16.7 +/- 4.0% [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>], p &lt; 0.05) and 50-microgram (21.7 +/- 4.5%) transforming growth factor-beta 1-treated groups when compared with the control group (31.9 +/- 6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow did not show any significant intergroup or intragroup variation over time, although the 10-microgram transforming growth factor-beta 1 group experienced a greater return of cerebral blood flow in the first 2 hours after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was not related to a direct effect on blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies are ongoing to determine the mechanism by which transforming growth factor-beta 1 salvages ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
