<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, a reduced activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> system and an increase of PLPRTA concentration have been observed from the 1st day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were also a decrease of the SDG activity and a marked (2,8 fold) increase of the alpha-GPDH activity as compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease of the AP leukocyte activity in the peripheral blood to day 7 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> makes possible a prognosis of good functional rehabilitation to the 21st day of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the results of the study suggest that the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is caused by tprimary disruption of bioenergetic processes during the reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
