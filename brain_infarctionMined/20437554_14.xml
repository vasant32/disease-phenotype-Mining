<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> is common and is associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and dependence, but appropriate management remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> insulin (GKI) infusion did not benefit patients with moderate poststroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in a recent trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), previous studies identified a relationship between recruitment of ischemic tissue to the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, possibly mediated by brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of GKI infusion in patients with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &gt;126mg/dl (7mmol/l) within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth on MRI between baseline and day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations were measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized, 15 to saline and 25 to GKI infusions of different durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Capillary blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were lowered significantly from 6 to 12 hours after GKI initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference on any measure of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth between the GKI and saline groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a secondary analysis, GKI was associated with significantly greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth in patients with complete intracranial vessel occlusion compared with controls (p = 0.011 for group-vessel status interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels increased in control subjects, but were significantly lower with GKI infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Predominantly asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> occurred in 76% of GKI-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: GKI infusion within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lowered blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and attenuated an increase in brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, but did not affect cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Exploratory analysis found that GKI infusion was associated with greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth in patients with persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, and with a high incidence of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
