<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A simple method to predict the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume within 6 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> based on the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) with techneticum-99m hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> ((99m)Tc-HMPAO) was investigated in a clinical model involving patients without definite early reperfusion or clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A group of 16 patients (group 1) was used to establish the methodology, which was then validated in a second group of 14 patients (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was defined using computed tomography (CT) performed at least 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative CBF threshold value, expressed as a percentage of the mean contralateral hemispheric value, which most closely estimated the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size on coregistered CT was established for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean threshold CBF value for group 1 was 63.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When this value was used to predict <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in group 2, a close correlation was observed between the actual and the estimated sizes (r = 0.973, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This value was not time dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: If no significant early reperfusion or clinical recovery occurs, a CBF threshold value of 63.7% on (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT performed within 6 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> will reliably predict the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
