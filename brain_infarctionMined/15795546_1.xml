<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between the pretreatment aspirin dosage and fatal outcome among these treated patient groups has not been analyzed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate 14- and 30-day poststroke survival in patients treated with 325 mg immediately on admission to the hospital for prestroke antiaggregation/anticoagulation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a government tertiary care facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 1245 patients admitted to the hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from 1997 to 2002 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between demographic parameters, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, prestroke antiaggregation/anticoagulation treatment, and risk of fatal poststroke outcome, 14 days and 30 days after the event, was analyzed using Cox survival analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 14-day poststroke period, 320 patients (25%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By day 30 poststroke, 386 patients (31%) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older age, female gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were associated with increased risk of increased fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by cardioembolism (P &lt; 0.0001) and was significantly lower in patients with small-vessel occlusion (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prestroke medium-dose aspirin treatment was associated with a relative reduction in 30-day poststroke period mortality (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, prestroke low-dose aspirin treatment was associated with increased mortality (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prestroke medium-dose aspirin treatment was associated with reduced 30-day poststroke mortality, whereas low-dose prestroke aspirin therapy was associated with increased 30-day poststroke mortality </plain></SENT>
