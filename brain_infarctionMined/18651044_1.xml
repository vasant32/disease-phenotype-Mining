<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (IBIs) were consecutively recruited and classified into subtypes by computed tomography and Bamford's classification (the size and site of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) as one of the following: total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (TACIs); partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (PACIs); posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (POCIs); and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls were recruited among individuals hospitalized for a reason other than cerebrovascular disease at the same institutions and matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls underwent B-mode ultrasonographic measurements of CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, and were evaluated by a qualified internist and neurologist for the presence of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> and a history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 75 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 10 (14%) were classified as TACIs, 34 (45%) as PACIs, 12 (16%) as POCIs and 19 (25%) as lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was higher in patients (1.03+/-0.18 mm) than in controls (0.85+/-0.18 mm; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The history of cerebrovascular disease was much lower in the patients with POCI and TACI, and the prevalence of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> was in the range of 20% in patients with TACIs to more than 40% in patients with PACIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased CCA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> as a marker of general <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was associated with IBI and reflects cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carotid and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were positively correlated with IBIs, with significant differences across the subtypes </plain></SENT>
