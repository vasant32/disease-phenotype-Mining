<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to examine the relationship between sex differences in the risk profile and SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and SBI on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We asked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the female participants about the age at natural menopause and parity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SBI was detected in 77 (11.3%) of 680 participants (266 men and 414 women) with a mean age of 64.5 (range 40-93) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the logistic analysis, age (odds ratio (OR)=2.760/10 years, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.037-3.738), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR=3.465, 95% CI=1.991-6.031), alcohol intake (OR=2.494, 95% CI=1.392-4.466) and smoking (OR=2.302, 95% CI=1.161-4.565) were significant factors concerning SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although SBI was more prevalent among men, this sex difference disappeared on the multivariate model after adjustment for other confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 215 women aged 60 years or older, age at natural menopause, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">early menopause</z:e>, duration of menopause, number of children and age at the last parity were not significantly associated with SBI after adjustment for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and age were considered to be the major risk factors for SBI in community-dwelling people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male predominance in SBI was largely due to higher prevalence of alcohol habit and smoking in men than in women in our population </plain></SENT>
