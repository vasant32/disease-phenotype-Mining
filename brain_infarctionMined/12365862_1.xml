<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors retrospectively investigated the relationship of anticoagulation intensity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 104 consecutive patients (mean age 70.8 +/- 10.0 years) who had suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> supratentorial cardioembolic infarction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, they analyzed risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (maximal area) on brain computed tomography, and modified Rankin scale score upon discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They compared these clinical data between patients who had received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> before the ictus and those who had not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, they investigated the effects of the international normalized ratio (INR) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and outcome in 19 patients who had been receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and had measurement of INR within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 25 patients who had received anticoagulation before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (A/C group) and 79 patients who had not (non-A/C group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in the A/C group tended to be smaller than that in the non-A/C group (p = 0.081, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 19 patients who had prior anticoagulation and measurement of INR within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were seen in 6 of 13 patients with INR &lt; 1.6 and in none of 6 patients with INR &gt; or = 1.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor clinical outcome was observed in 5 patients with INR &lt; 1.6, but in none with INR &gt; or = 1.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with INR &gt; or = 1.6 appears to effectively prevent a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and poor outcome, even when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> dose occurs in patients with an emboligenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
