<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to detect two commonly reported Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms in TLR4 gene in Hunan Han Chinese and their possible relationship with CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using the method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), the polymorphisms TLR4, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, were determined in 366 CI patients and 200 controls from Changsha area of Hunan Province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) also was detected by Bmode ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested both the TLR4, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, genetic polymorphisms were not observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects from Hunan Changsha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we speculate they might not be an important factor in the development of CI in the Chinese </plain></SENT>
