<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Even though adiponectin is associated with many traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, studies assessing the association between adiponectin and cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the odds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> at different plasma levels of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted involving 5243 subjects, drawn from 12 490 subjects of the Jichi Medical School Cohort Study, whose blood samples had been drawn between 1992 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over an average of 9.7 years of follow-up, through 2005, 179 patients with cerebrovascular events were identified, in addition to 630 controls matched for age, sex, and community (total n=809) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were estimated relative to the highest quartile of adiponectin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was neither a significant difference in the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between the lowest and highest adiponectin quartiles, nor a significant linear trend toward a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at higher adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results did not change after excluding participants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the lowest quartile were significantly higher than in the highest quartile, when adjusted for age and sex (OR 2.04 [95% CI, 1.09 to 3.80]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the odds failed to achieve statistical significance when adjusted further for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Again exclusion of subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> did not alter results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin levels are not independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of adiponectin as a cerebrovascular disease predictor may be premature </plain></SENT>
