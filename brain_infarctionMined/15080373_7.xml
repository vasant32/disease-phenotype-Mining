<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Controversy persists as to whether reducing the blood pressure of patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> leads to an increased risk of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (SBI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 667 patients were randomized to receive the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> (4 mg daily), with or without the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> indapamide (2 mg daily) or matching placebo(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain CT scanning was performed annually over the mean follow-up period of 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active treatment reduced the blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) by 5.2/2.6 mmHg over the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 119 new SBI were detected and 92% of them were lacunar type small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of reaching the primary end-point (recurrent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or new SBI) was similar in the placebo group (26.5%) and in the active treatment group (25.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> indices between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup with a history of large artery infarction, 7 out of 55 patients from the placebo group developed new SBI, while none of the 40 patients from the active treatment group did so (p = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The baseline diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with the risk of new SBI (p = 0.004), but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, blood pressure-lowering with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi>-based regimen did not increase the risk of SBI and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The baseline diastolic blood pressure was an independent predictor of new SBI, but the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype did not influence the risk of SBI </plain></SENT>
