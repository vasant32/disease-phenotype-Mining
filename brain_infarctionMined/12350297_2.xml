<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They included 26 cases of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five infants who died from congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo>, two from infected pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, two from septic shock with multi-organ failure, one during a prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, one from a prolonged neonatal hypoxemia, one from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the infants had been recorded during one night in a pediatric sleep laboratory some 3-12 weeks before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apneas</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The infants' brain stem material was collected and immunohistochemistry of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The density of GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes was measured in the cardiorespiratory and arousal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Akaike information criterion statistics (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>) were calculated to elucidate the relationship between the epidemiological data on sleep position, the physiological data and the pathological data in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> victims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> was the most significant variable to differentiate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> victims and control infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study sustains the possibility of an organic fragility within the arousal pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> victims with repetitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apneas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
