<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morg1 also attenuates expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by activating or stabilizing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi>-hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate for the first time that Morg1 is expressed in the human brain in neurons, glial cells, and blood vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, RT real-time PCR and western blotting indicated that Morg1 expression is reduced in human brain tissue with ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, reactive astrocytes in the surrounding brain tissue showed strong Morg1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since hypoxic adaptation with enhancing HIF-1alpha expression can engage a genetic program leading to profound sparing of brain tissue and enhanced recovery of function, down-regulation of Morg1 expression in the ischemic brain may be viewed as an intrinsic mechanism to stimulate this response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, upregulation of Morg1 in astrocytes surrounding the penumbra may counteract this hypoxic adaptation </plain></SENT>
