<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are common in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to explore incidence, manifestations, and predictors of such <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a population-based, longitudinal study of 5888 people aged &gt; or =65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants have had extensive baseline and follow-up evaluations; 1433 participants underwent 2 MRI scans separated by 5 years and had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on initial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On follow-up MRI, 254 participants (17.7%) had 1 or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most were single (75.6%), subcortical (79.9%), and small (3 to 20 mm in 87.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 11.4% of those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> experienced a documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between the scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although participants were similar at initial MRI, those with MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on follow-up experienced greater decline than those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit-Symbol Substitution test (both P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severity of white matter changes on initial MRI was the strongest predictor of incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When it was excluded from stepwise multivariable models, predictors were serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, age, and ankle-arm index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incident MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> commonly affect the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most are small, subcortical, and not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms recognized as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, they cannot be considered silent because of their association with subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These covert <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are associated with white matter changes, which may share a common pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whether control of vascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, would reduce the risk of developing these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
