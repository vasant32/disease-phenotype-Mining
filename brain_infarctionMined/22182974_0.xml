<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is neuroprotective in rats in vivo when delivered by intraperitoneal injection 30 min following <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, when assessed 15 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single dose of 1 g/kg hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> size by 28.57% compared with control (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also report that the same compound reduces neuronal excitability in hippocampal slices and propose that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is neuroprotective by reducing excitotoxicity in the delayed phase of brain damage </plain></SENT>
