<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors included first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurring between 1994 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They assessed incidence, risk factors, mortality, and recurrence in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors identified 491 patients (15.3%) with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (252 men and 239 women) and 2,153 patients (67.3%) with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (998 men and 1,155 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude annual incidence rate for a first-ever lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 33.0/100,000 (95% CI 30.2 to 36.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the univariate logistic regression analysis among patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> there was a higher proportion of cigarette smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and a lower proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> than in patients with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the 30-day case-fatality rate was 4.3% (95% CI 2.5 to 6.1) and the 1-year case-fatality rate was 13.0% (95% CI 10.0 to 16.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the first year of follow-up the average annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was lower in patients with lacunar (2.83%; 95% CI 1.36 to 4.30) than in those with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (5.10%; 95% CI 4.17 to 6.03) while from the second year onward, rates were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the short term, patients with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had more vascular events, but in the long term, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was similar </plain></SENT>
