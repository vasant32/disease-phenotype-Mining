<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether there is a direct correlation between plasma fibrinogen levels and the amount of leukoaraiosis (LA) in patients with symptomatic small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 28 patients: 12 with a first-ever <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LI) and 16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 71 years (SD 8.6), and 21 were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each patient, we recorded demographic data, vascular risk factors and the results of blood chemistry analysis including fibrinogen (g/l), hematocrit (decimal fraction) and total serum proteins (g/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scan was performed in each patient and an LA score was obtained by an investigator blind to clinical data, using a semiquantified scale in six areas of each cerebral hemisphere (0-4 points in each area, total scoring range 0-48 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) for the LA score was 18.9 (10.7) and for plasma fibrinogen 3.97 (1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients between fibrinogen and LA score were 0.43 (p = 0.02) and 0.49 (p = 0.007), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple-regression analysis between groups (LI or BD) and fibrinogen versus LA score showed the strongest association for the BD group (p = 0.014) and a direct relation with fibrinogen (p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant association was found between LA score and age, sex, any vascular risk factor, hematocrit or total serum protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a significant correlation between plasma fibrinogen levels and the amount of LA in patients with symptomatic cerebral small-vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that fibrinogen may be involved in the pathophysiology of LA in these patients </plain></SENT>
