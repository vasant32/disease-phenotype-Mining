<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interest is growing in the role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) on P2 receptors during hypoxic/ischemic events in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is no direct evidence of an increase in extracellular ATP levels during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate ATP outflow from the rat striatum by the microdialysis technique associated with focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1 and 4h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, rats showed a clear turning behavior contralateral to the ischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, ischemic rats had definite neurological deficit and striatal and cortical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ATP concentration (mean+/-S.E.M.) in the striatum of normoxic rats (n = 8) was 3.10+/-0.34 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 220 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the extracellular ATP levels significantly increased two-fold, being 5.90+/-0.61 nM (p &lt; 0.01 versus normoxic level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATP outflow showed a tendency to increase over time during the 220 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since extracellular ATP is rapidly metabolized to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, we also assessed ATP outflow in the presence of the ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor, alpha,beta-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (AOPCP, 1 mM) directly perfused into the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ATP concentration in normoxic rats (n = 8) was increased three-fold in the presence of the ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor (9.57+/-0.26 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During 220 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, extracellular ATP levels significantly increased 1.3-fold in AOPCP-treated rats (12.62+/-0.65 nM, p &lt; 0.01 versus normoxic level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms that ATP is continuously released in the brain and demonstrates for the first time that ATP outflow increases during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that ATP may be an important mediator in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
