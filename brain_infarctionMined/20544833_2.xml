<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the influences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on endothelial function in the cerebral cortex and the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agents</z:chebi> against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> through the preservation of endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five- and ten-week-old male Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used for experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five-week-old SHR received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi>, hydralazine, or vehicle for 5 weeks in drinking water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>eNOS activation in the cerebral cortex was evaluated by analyzing levels of total and Ser(1177)-phosphorylated eNOS protein by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure of 10-week-old SHR without treatment was clearly high, and the ratio of phospho-eNOS/total eNOS protein was significantly low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-week treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> or hydralazine suppressed the elevation of blood pressure and the reduction of phosphorylated eNOS-Ser(1177) in SHR, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> was more effective in maintaining phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser(1177) than hydralazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assess the contribution of eNOS to maintaining cerebral blood flow (CBF), we monitored CBF by laser-Doppler flowmetry after L-N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> (L-NIO) infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CBF response to L-NIO was preserved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi>-treated SHR but not in hydralazine-treated SHR </plain></SENT>
