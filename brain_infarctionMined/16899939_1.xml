<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood plasma viscosity, as well as red blood cells (RBC) aggregability were quantitatively investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both of the above mentioned indices of hemorheological disorders were significantly higher in the patients with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> as compared to the control and the group of ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, blood plasma viscosity was increased by a mean of 9.2 per cent in the first and by a mean of 17.6 per cent in the second group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As to the erythrocyte aggregability index, it was changed considerably more - by a mean of 113.8 per cent during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while in the diabetic patients the RBC aggregability index was found to be increased by a mean of 147.3 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were associated with a significant increase of the patients' blood rheological disorders in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the investigated cases </plain></SENT>
