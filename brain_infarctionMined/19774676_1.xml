<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to characterize circulating EPCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD), one of the most common pediatric cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight children with MMD prior to any surgical treatment and 12 healthy volunteers were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were isolated and cultured in endothelial cell growth medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temporal change of phenotype of cells was analyzed on days 0 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The formation of EPC clusters was evaluated on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CD34(+), CD133(+), and KDR(+) cells, and the number of EPC clusters was significantly reduced in children with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In controls, CD34(+) cells were significantly decreased on day 7 compared with day 0, but in MMD they were only slightly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in KDR(+) cells on day 7 compared with day 0 was the reverse of that for CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional assay of EPC demonstrated less tube formation and increased senescent-like phenotype in children with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the circulating EPCs of MMD children reveals decreased level and defective function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that circulating EPCs may be associated with MMD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
