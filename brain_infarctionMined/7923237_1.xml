<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 12 children (8 female and 4 male) aged 2.2-14.3 years, whose computed tomographic (CT) examination had shown evidence of malacic and/or porencephalic outcomes of early vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Topographic spectral electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the awake state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following spectral EEG variables were studied: topography, absolute and relative power of delta, theta, alpha, beta bands, overall power, and peak alpha frequency asymmetries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of topographic spectral EEG analysis were compared with the localization and nature of lesions as detected by CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depending on the nature of the lesions, we were able to identify two different spectral patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Porencephalic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were characterized by an increase in delta and theta bands in the areas surrounding the lesion sites, as identified by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spectral EEG patterns of malacic outcomes resulted in a focal increase in theta and delta band power, corresponding to the topography of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in 9/12 subjects an asymmetry of alpha rhythm in occipital leads was found homolaterally to the lesion sites, associated with a decrease in power, without any CT evidence of an occipital lesion </plain></SENT>
