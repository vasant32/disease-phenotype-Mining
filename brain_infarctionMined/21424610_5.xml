<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> plays an important role in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aims of this study were to examine the serum levels of 13 cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in AIS patients, and their relationship to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lateralization, type, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients with AIS were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken within 72 h, and volumetric analyses performed within 1-7 days after AIS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokines were measured in serum from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and from 40 control subjects using Luminex Bio-Plex XMap technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of interleukin (IL)-1ra (p &lt; 0.001), IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001), IL-8 (p &lt; 0.001), IL-9 (p = 0.038), IL-10 (p = 0.001), IL-12 (p = 0.001), IL-18 (p &lt; 0.001), and GRO-α (CXCL1) (p = 0.017) were significantly higher in the AIS patients than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IL-8 level was significantly correlated with age in the patient group (r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the variables were found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly positively correlated with CRP level (r = 0.47, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with radiologically confirmed infarctions had significantly elevated serum levels of GRO-α (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cytokine profile of the AIS patients supports not only earlier findings of a proinflammatory response but also early activation of endogenous immunosuppressive mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Novel findings of this study are elevated serum levels of IL-9 and GRO-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Elevated GRO-α in AIS patients with radiologically confirmed infarctions suggests that GRO-α is specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of known etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that CRP plays an important role in the progression of cerebral tissue injury </plain></SENT>
