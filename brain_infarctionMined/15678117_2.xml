<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of FK419, a novel nonpeptide GPIIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) patency and ischemic brain damage in a thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model in squirrel monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FK419 not only inhibited in vitro platelet aggregation (IC50: 88 nmol/L), but also showed disaggregatory activity to aggregated platelet (EC50: 286 nmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FK419 dose-dependently reduced the time to first reperfusion and total occlusion time of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow when administered immediately after the termination of photoirradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FK419 reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and ameliorated neurologic deficits with similar dose-dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although rt-PA reduced the time to first reperfusion, total occlusion time, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, it did not significantly ameliorate neurologic deficits and induced petechial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate: (1) FK419 restored cerebral blood flow after thrombotic occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, (2) FK419 reduced ischemic brain injury by its thrombolytic actions in a non-human primate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, and (3) FK419 has superior antithrombotic efficacy and is safer than rt-PA </plain></SENT>
