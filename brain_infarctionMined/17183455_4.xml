<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemokines are cytokines attracting selective leukocyte subsets and subgrouping into the four major subfamilies, CC, CXC, C, and CX3C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CC subfamily preferentially acts on mononuclears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to define serum CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and their relationship to the extent of disease severity and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>27 ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 20 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood sampling for the determination of chemokines was performed at days 1, 2 and 3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, while neurological and functional deficits were estimated, respectively, with the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (SSS) and Barthel Index (BI) at the same time points and at days 14 and 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum CCL3 levels at days 1, 2 and 3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significantly higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum CCL2 and CCL5 levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients did not differ from those in controls at any of the time points examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum chemokine levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studied separately did not differ between each other at any time point studied and demonstrated considerable variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation between serum chemokine levels and SSS scores was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum CCL2 and CCL3 levels at days 1, 2 and 3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> correlated with BI scores at day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum CCL2 levels at days 2 and 3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also correlated with BI scores at day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serum CCL5 levels at day 2 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> correlated with BI scores at day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The early and sustained increase in serum CCL3 levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients along with correlation between them and short-term poststroke functional disability could indicate that the chemokine response may predispose to poor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The relationship between non-increased serum CCL2 and CCL5 levels and worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome seems to be coincidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall, as a result of large interindividual variability, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 are not reliable candidates for surrogate markers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
