<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To obtain direct evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> serves as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> in vivo, four groups of rats were prepared: (i) an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) group receiving 2 h occlusion-reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery; (ii) a single administration group treated by intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg) immediately after I/R; (iii) a repeated treatment group receiving twice daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> administration for 14 days; and (iv) a sham operation group without occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeated treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> significantly improved the neurological symptoms and impairment of motor function as compared to the I/R group, while single administration demonstrated limited efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in plasma <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi>, urate, and vitamin E, or in redox status of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q(9) were observed among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the plasma content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> in the total free fatty acids (percentage 18:1) was significantly increased in the I/R group for 7 days as compared to the sham operation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">Oleic acid</z:chebi> was produced from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi> by the action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi> desaturase to compensate for the oxidative loss of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The above results suggest that cellular oxidative damage in the rat brain is evident for at least 7 days after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeated treatment suppressed the percentage 18:1 increment, while the single administration did not, which is consistent with the limited efficacy of single administration </plain></SENT>
