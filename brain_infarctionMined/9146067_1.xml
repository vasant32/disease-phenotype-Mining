<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 42 patients diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (22 embolism, 17 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte accumulation was studied using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111-labeled leukocyte brain single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was evaluated by CT and/or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were compared with the cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after CBF study by SPECT using either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxine (Tc-99m-HMPAO) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m ethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>), In-111-labeled autologous leukocytes were injected intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain scan for leukocytes was performed after 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was used for neurological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> showed intensive accumulation of leukocytes in the region of low flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte's accumulation was not seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of leukocytes was more noticeable in the central zone of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who showed negative leukocyte accumulation revealed clinically mild functional outcome and the size of infarction on CT and/or MRI was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The regional accumulation of leukocytes was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with hemorrhagic infarction, but the degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on CT did not have significant influence on the amount of leukocyte accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Abnormal accumulation of leukocytes was associated with reduced CBF during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present clinical study revealed that leukocyte accumulation correlated with the poor neurological functional outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms that leukocytes contribute to the ischemic tissue damage of the brain and demonstrates a clinical evidence that the regional accumulation of leukocytes has a deleterious effect on the brain following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
