<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical and quantitative studies on vascular reaction (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>) in cortical border zone of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensity and temporal profile of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was assessed in 60 patients aged between 48 and 69 (younger group), and between 70 and 92 (older group), with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the area of middle cerebral artery vascularization, who died during the first six weeks following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have found that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was a multistage process in which four stages were distinguished: phase of primary activation of endothelial cells, two consecutive phases of active <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and final phase of only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> proliferation of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distinction of phases in a multiphase angiogenic cascade helped us to evaluate the correlation with survival time and the age of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most pronounced intensification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and increased density of CD 31 positive capillaries in penumbra were observed in the second phase, especially in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of the penumbral neovascularization decreased in the older age patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that sprouting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is a quantitatively significant source of vessels in the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, non-therapeutically stimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> developed only 3-4 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, that is beyond the period of reversible changes in ischemic penumbra recognized as a "therapeutical window" in the human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The angiogenic therapy opens a new way towards the revascularization of ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
