<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morbidity after coronary artery surgery annually consumes $750 million in health-care resources in-hospital and about $500 million in posthospitalization care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 million patients who undergo noncardiac surgery annually in the United States, more than 1 million suffer postsurgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual in-hospital cost of this morbidity is $10 billion, with posthospitalization care costing $12 billion more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early efforts to reduce perioperative cardiovascular and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system morbidity focused largely on the development and use of technologies designed to achieve earlier detection of end-point surrogates </plain></SENT>
