<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> may influence cognitive performances at early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> but not in late stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is associated with subcortical hyperintensities in patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 170 consecutive MCI patients (mean follow-up, 3.8+/-1.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed subcortical hyperintensities on a baseline magnetic resonance imaging scan with a semiquantitative rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was calculated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale at baseline and the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with patients whose cognitive performances remained stable or improved during follow-up, patients whose cognitive performances declined often had a larger amount (greater than the median of the distribution) of periventricular (PVH) (P=0.0005) and white-matter (P=0.02) hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> was higher with increasing PVH: mean change in the Mini-Mental State Examination score=0.16 vs -0.66 points/year in patients with PVH in the first versus third tertile (P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of decline in executive functioning was also higher with increasing PVH: mean change in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> Rating Scale initiation subscore=-0.05 vs -1.42 points/year in patients with PVH in the first versus third tertile (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were independent of vascular risk factors, temporal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and MCI subtype and were stronger in patients with baseline executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: White-matter hyperintensities and especially PVH were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in MCI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This result was independent of the MCI subtype but stronger in cases of executive dysfunction at baseline </plain></SENT>
