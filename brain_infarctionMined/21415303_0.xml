<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present series describes MRI in four cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which revealed bithalamic infarctions with or without haemorrhages in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral malaria</z:e>, and this review examines a subset of patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemorrhagic infarctions were also seen the in brain stem, cerebellum, cerebral white matter and insular cortex in two of the four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this series, the patient with cerebellum and brain stem involvement died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining three survived with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38068">antimalarial</z:chebi> and supportive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No neurological symptoms were noted on clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI follow-up was obtained in only one of the three patients (3 months post-treatment) and showed resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These imaging features may help in the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral malaria</z:e> so that early treatment can begin and improve the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
