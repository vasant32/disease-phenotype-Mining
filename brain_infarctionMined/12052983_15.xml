<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Severe motor deficits are the predominant cause of long-term disability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in the initial stage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is frequently devastating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we attempted to define the population at risk with respect to the presumed pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 941 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients hospitalized during a 3-year period, 92 patients (41 men, 51 women; mean age, 68 years) had a severe motor deficit (&lt;25 of 42 points on the 7 motor items of the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale) resulting from brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors, neurological examinations, comprehensive diagnostic tests, and therapy were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study population was separated into patients with (group A) and without (group B) progressive motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression was defined as a further decrease of at least 5 points on the initial European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale motor score during the first 5 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 92 patients, 23.9% had significant worsening of motor function with a decrease in the mean European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale motor score from 20.3 to 12.9 points (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> in group A patients were subcortical in 59.1%, whereas most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were cortical in group B (61.4%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was also significantly associated with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (group A:, 59.1%; group B, 24.3%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With regard to risk factors, diagnostic studies, and neuroimaging, small-vessel disease was the predominant presumed cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in group A (63.6%, P&lt;0.01), whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in group B patients were frequently caused by embolism from cardiac or undetermined sources (61.4%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was not significantly different between groups A and B; however, subtotal stenoses and complete internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were found only among patients without progressive motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by small-vessel disease is the major cause of progressive motor deficits, probably because of stepwise occlusion of the branches of small penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
