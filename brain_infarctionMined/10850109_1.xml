<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombolysis for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: On July 1st, 1998 thrombolytic therapy for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was introduced in the University Hospital Maastricht, the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients admitted with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively registered during the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it was determined how many were potentially eligible for thrombolysis within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and how many of these patients were actually treated with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the reasons for exclusion from thrombolytic therapy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several baseline and clinical patient characteristics were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first year 18 ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were treated with thrombolysis within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 18 patients constituted 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 256 ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 18% of the potentially eligible patients who arrived in the hospital within 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than 40% of the ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were not eligible for thrombolysis due to late arrival in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications in the 18 treated patients: 3 patients developed an asymptomatic haemorrhagic transformation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> thrombolysis for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 3 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is feasible, and can under specific conditions be applied in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients underwent thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This percentage of patients could be increased by an earlier presentation of patients to the hospital </plain></SENT>
