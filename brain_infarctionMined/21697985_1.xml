<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The occurrence of brain ischemic lesions, due to temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> or incorrect placement of the definitive clip, is a major complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temporary clipping is a current technique during surgery and there is no reliable method of predicting the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to extended regional circulatory interruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even with careful inspection, misplacement of the definitive clip can be difficult to detect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue oxygen concentration (PtiO(2)) was monitored during surgery of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), for detection of changes in brain oxygenation due to reduced blood flow, as a predictor of ischemic events, during temporary clipping and after definitive clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PtiO(2) was monitored during surgery of 13 patients harboring <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with SAH, using a polarographic microcatheter (Licox, GMS, Kiel, Germany) placed in the territory of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A decrease in PtiO(2) values was verified in every period of temporary clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> occurred in 2 patients; in both cases, there was a decrease in PtiO(2) greater than 80% from basal value, a minimum value of less than 2 mmHg persisting for 2 or more minutes during temporary clipping, and an incomplete recovery of PtiO(2) after definitive clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, incomplete recovery of values after definitive clipping led to verification of inappropriate placement and repositioning of the clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that intraoperative monitoring of PtiO(2) may be a useful method of detection of changes in brain tissue oxygenation during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative infarction in the territory of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> developed in cases with an abrupt decrease of PtiO(2) and a very low and persistent minimum value, during temporary clipping, and an incomplete recovery after definitive clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Verification of clip position should be considered when there is an incomplete recovery or a persistent fall in PtiO(2) after definitive clipping </plain></SENT>
