<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 69-year-old woman, who fell into a hypotensive shock (B.P. below 40 mmHg) of unknown origin during examination of her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> and was admitted into CCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After admission, hypotensive shocks were repeated four times (B.P. below 50 mmHg each time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0011099'>spastic hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain CT on 10th day showed bilaterally low density areas around the basal ganglia and a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She gradually presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> and symptomatic changes from pyramidal to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain CT on 24th day showed bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the basal ganglia with enhanced effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On 79th day, she again fell into shock and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination of the brain was as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1) laminar <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, 2) bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the hippocampal Sommer sector, 3) bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the caudate nucleus, putamen and pallidum with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and infiltration of fat granule cells, 4) sparing of the internal capsules, 5) bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the reticular zone of the substantia nigra, 6) foci of fresh <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These lesions are consistent with those of selective vulnerability in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> as described by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLD">Scholz</z:e> et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An extensive distribution of cerebral as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0012128'>basal ganglia necrosis</z:hpo> in this case was caused by repeated shocks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
