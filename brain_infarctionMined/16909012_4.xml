<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (pHcy) levels are reported to be associated with an increased risk of poor cognition and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high pHcy levels are associated with an increased risk of coexisting silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (SBIs) in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study population comprising 143 outpatients with clinical diagnosis of probable AD (73.3 +/- 7.0 years) were classified into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of SBIs on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SBIs were noted in 32.9% (47/143) of the AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pHcy levels in the AD with SBIs (14.0 +/- 4.5 micromol/l) were significant ly elevated compared with the AD without SBIs (11.7 +/- 4.7 micromol/l, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age and gender, high pHcy (&gt;12.4 micromol/l), but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, was associated with an increased risk of developing SBIs in AD (OR = 4.61, 95% CI = 1.74-12.2, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, cognitive function, cerebrospinal tau or amyloid beta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>(1-42) levels were not significantly correlated with pHcy levels in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SBIs commonly coexist with AD, and may be a unique vascular condition in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> plays an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi>-lowering therapy rather than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication might be an appropriate strategy to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with AD </plain></SENT>
