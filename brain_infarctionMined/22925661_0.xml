<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have investigated the neuroprotective effect of 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg(3) (20(R)-Rg(3)) against transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2h in rats and then reperfused for 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The behavioral disturbance was evaluated according to neurological deficit scores, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining; in addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was examined using the method of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated d-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of calpain I and caspase-3 mRNA in hippocampal CA1 region were further assayed using in situ hybridization, in order to clarify the neuroprotective mechanism of 20(R)-Rg(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>20(R)-Rg(3) at the doses of 10 and 20mgkg(-1) i.p., but not 5mgkg(-1), showed significant neuroprotective effect in rats against focal cerebral ischemic injury by markedly reducing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and degrading <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate of TTC-stained coronal brain sections, and improving behavior of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggested that 20(R)-Rg(3) (10 and 20mgkg(-1)) could significantly suppress the expressions of calpain I and caspase-3 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that 20(R)-Rg(3) attenuates the neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury and its neuprotective effect may be involved in the downregulation of calpain I and caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
