<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Autopsy studies found that lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> differ in the size of the underlying brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and that small lacunes are usually caused by hypertensive small-artery disease (SAD) and larger ones by atheromatous or embolic perforator occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that larger lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> might cause more severe neurological deficits and a higher detection rate on brain imaging compared with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> caused by SAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective observational study was performed to investigate whether (1) neurological outcome, (2) prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, (3) prevalence of clinically asymptomatic occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e>, and (4) detection rate of underlying lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at brain imaging differ in ischemic lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with (non-SAD) and without potential etiologies other than SAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=244), defined by both clinical findings and brain imaging, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit was quantified at presentation with the use of the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and after 3 months with the NIHSS and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteries were investigated by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with patients with SAD lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n=155; 64%), patients with non-SAD lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n=89; 36%) had (1) higher NIHSS scores at presentation and higher NIHSS and mRS scores after 3 months (P&lt;0.05); a higher prevalence of (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05), (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001), (4) previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.01), and (5) asymptomatic stenoses of intracranial cerebral (P&lt;0.01 to P&lt;0.0001) and extracranial carotid (30% to 50% narrowing; P&lt;0.01) arteries; and (6) a higher detection rate of the underlying lesion at brain imaging (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with non-SAD lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> have a worse clinical outcome and a higher prevalence of large cerebral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> than patients with SAD lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
