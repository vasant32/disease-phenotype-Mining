<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebellar venous infarction or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the posterior fossa is a rare form of intracranial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that can be unsuspected in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 230 patients with intracranial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, identifying 9 (3.9%: 7 women, mean age 34 years) with neuroimaging or histopathologic evidence of localized posterior fossa vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> causing parenchymal injury limited exclusively to the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an insidious presentation suggesting other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n=6) and cerebellar (n=4) syndromes were the main clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was idiopathic in 3 patients; associated with puerperium in 3; and with contraceptives, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> in 1 case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT was abnormal but not diagnostic in 5 patients, showing a cerebellar hypodensity with fourth ventricle compression and variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in 5 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional MRI provided diagnosis in 6 cases, showing the causal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and cerebellar involvement; angiography was practiced in 2 of them, confirming the findings identified by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other 3 patients, diagnosis was reached by histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thromboses were localized at the straight sinus (n=4), lateral sinuses (n=3), and superior petrosal vein (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> case fatality rate was 22.2% (n=2), 1 (11.1%) patient was discharged in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vegetative state</z:e>, 1 (11.1%) was severely disabled, and 5 (55.6%) were moderately disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the posterior fossa is infrequent and implies a challenging diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for intracranial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and atypical cerebellar findings on CT should lead to further MRI assessment </plain></SENT>
