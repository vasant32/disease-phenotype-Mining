<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, the middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was produced by occlusion of right internal carotid artery with a nylon monofilament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into ten groups according to random digits table, 10 rats were in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first experiment involved I/R model control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) control, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (NS) control, AG490, DMTU and combination of AG490 and DMTU (A+D) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second experiment involved model group and three experimental groups in which various doses of DMTU and AG490 were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurological behavior scores (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>) were assessed at 24, 48 and 72 hours after reperfusion respectively in both experiments, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals were then decapitated to determine the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The values of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> in A+D group, AG490 group and DMTU group were higher than those in model group at 24, 48 and 72 hours after I/R, and their brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were obviously smaller than model group as well (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in A+D group was obviously smaller compared with AG490 and DMTU alone (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The values of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> were higher and the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were smaller in both high dose and medium dose combination groups than those in low dose combination and model groups respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes in high dose group were smaller than medium dose group (P&lt;0.05), but there was no statistically significant difference between low dose and model groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combined application of AG490 and DMTU produces a dose-dependent synergistic neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
