<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We know remarkably little about the mechanisms underlying cortical activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such mechanisms might be better understood by studying the effect of well-localized lesions on the cortical activations in simple paradigms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used H(2)(15)O and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at rest and during hand vibration in 7 patients with unilateral thalamic lesion involving the ventroposterior (VP) somatosensory thalamic relay nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the results with those obtained in 6 patients with thalamic lesions sparing the VP nuclei and 6 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients with VP lesions had a selective hypoperfusion at rest in the ipsilesional primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This hypoperfusion was significantly correlated with the degree of contralateral somatosensory deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This abnormality may reflect the deafferentation of SM1 from its somatosensory thalamic input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite this deafferentation, the ipsilesional SM1 was normally activated by the vibration of the hypoesthetic hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The fact that a lesion of the somatosensory thalamic relay nuclei alters the rCBF at rest in SM1 but not its activation by hand vibration indicates that the mechanism of cortical activation is complex, even in the case of simple sensory stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a dissociation may occur between obvious neurological deficits and apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activation patterns, which suggests that activation studies should be interpreted cautiously in patients with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
