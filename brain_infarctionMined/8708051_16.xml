<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In this article we investigate the application of a method that uses the relaxation effect of bolus-like injected Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> to quantify regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine if the method provides correct rCBV values in healthy subjects as well as to obtain additional diagnostic information for patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty healthy subjects, 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e>, and 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of 64 sequential images of one slice was recorded during bolus transit with a FLASH sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measured signal intensity-time curves were converted pixel-wise to concentration-time curves from which the rCBV images were calculated applying the indicator dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An average value for gray and white matter of 4.4 +/- 1.6 vol% was obtained for the group of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The grading of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> could be classified according to the differences of their corresponding rCBV values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients had to be excluded from the analysis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase due to mispositioning of the slice and data degradation by gross motion artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Different rCBV values were found for areas that develop later into gliotic scars or cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proposed method is easy to apply in clinical routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> investigations and provides valuable information for noninvasive, preoperative assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can also provide additional criteria for estimating the histological outcome and with it the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
