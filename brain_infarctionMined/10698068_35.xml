<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The evolution of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> during permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was studied in mice using multiparametric imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional protein synthesis and the regional tissue content of ATP were measured on adjacent cryostat sections at increasing intervals after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> ranging from 1 hour to 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observed changes were correlated with the expression of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of hsp70, c-fos, c-jun, and junB, as well as the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks visualized by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labelling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the tissue volume with suppressed protein synthesis was distinctly larger than that in which ATP was depleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time, the ATP-depleted area gradually expanded and, within 1 day, merged with the region of suppressed protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> occurred mainly in the penumbra (defined as the region of suppressed protein synthesis but preserved ATP), peaking at 3 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the immediate-early genes c-jun, c-fos, and junB increased both in the penumbra and the periinfarct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue already at 1 hour after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, with slightly different regional and temporal patterns for each of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentations were clearly confined to neurons; they appeared after 1 day in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core (defined as the region of suppressed ATP) and never were detected in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The late appearance of TUNEL after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had reached their final size and the absence in the penumbra points against a major pathogenetic role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion in mice thus produces a gradually expanding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the final size of which is heralded by the early inhibition of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
