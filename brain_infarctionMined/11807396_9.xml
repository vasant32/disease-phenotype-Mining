<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty rats were subjected to 3 hours of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by occluding the left middle cerebral and left common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The propagation of recurrent depolarization around the ischemic core was analyzed using direct-current potential and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> (reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</z:chebi>) fluorescence images by irradiating the parietal-temporal cortex with ultraviolet light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on histological evaluation at direct-current recording sites, the total time of depolarization causing 50% neuronal injury was estimated to be 18.2 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sites showing recurrent depolarizations resulted in 23 +/- 29% neuronal injury due to the short depolarization time, whereas the sites showing recurrent depolarizations and eventually persistent depolarization resulted in infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence images showed that recurrent depolarizations propagated along the margin of the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 85.9% of the recurrent depolarizations, the fluorescence disappeared without leaving any traces and did not affect the area of the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in 47.5% of the animals, 14.1% of recurrent depolarizations merged with the ischemic core and increased the area by 6 +/- 4 mm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that recurrent depolarization increases the severity of neuronal injury but does not cause infarction by itself if persistent depolarization does not follow, and that the area of persistent depolarization is enlarged with 14.1% of recurrent depolarizations </plain></SENT>
