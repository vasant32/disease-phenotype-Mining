<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with unilateral occlusion of either the middle cerebral artery or the internal carotid artery (4 men and 5 women; mean+/-SD age, 74.4+/-11.6 years) were studied within 6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative CBV (relCBV) and CBF (relCBF) in the lesions were defined relative to the contralateral mirror regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the brain regions with mild (relCBF &gt;/=0.60), moderate (0.40&lt;/=relCBF&lt;0.60), and severe (relCBF &lt;0.40) hypoperfusion, the mean relCBV values were 1.29+/-0.31, 0.94+/-0.49, and 0.30+/-0.22, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relCBV was significantly elevated in the brain areas with mild hypoperfusion (P&lt;0.001) and significantly reduced in the brain areas with severe hypoperfusion (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relCBF was significantly better than the relCBV in predicting the evolution of infarction (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of evolving infarction for the hypervolemic (relCBV &gt;1.0) regions was significantly lower than that for hypovolemic (relCBV &lt;1.0) regions in the relCBF range between 0.40 and 0.50 (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> the CBV can be either increased, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, or decreased, depending on the severity of hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased CBV has a protective effect on evolving infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the CBF is a better predictor of tissue outcome, the CBV measurement may help detect potentially salvageable brain tissue in the penumbra with compromised blood flow </plain></SENT>
