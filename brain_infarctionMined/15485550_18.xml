<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we tested whether this <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> may also be suitable for prophylactic use against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> was administrated orally for 9 wk (4 mg/kg/day) in mice and its effects on subsequent injury development after 90 min of intraluminal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate its neuroprotective properties, the protective actions of prophylactic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> were compared with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> (4 mg/kg, i.p.) administration and with a diluent (sham)-treated control condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion resulted in reproducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as revealed by laser Doppler flowmetry; this was followed by a rapid restoration of blood flow immediately after reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laser Doppler flow values after reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were moderately elevated by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, both when the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> was given prophylactically and when acutely administrated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control animals, reproducible brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed 24 hr after reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by approximately 30-35%, independent of whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> was given prophylactically before or acutely after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To test whether brain protection involved vascular mechanisms, as suggested earlier, the effects of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> on endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) levels were studied using Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, delivery of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> was accompanied by a marked inhibition of ECE-1 levels, which was similarly seen after both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>, given at pharmacological doses, may be suitable as a prophylaxis against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tissue protection may involve an inhibition of ECE-1, which improves vasodilation, after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
