<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although its important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has already been documented, the underlying mechanism was not clarified yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the impacts of AQP4 deletion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein we found a higher mortality and more severe neurological deficits in AQP4 knockout (AQP4(-/-)) mice after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> while no difference was observed in water content variation during I/R between two genotypes except a higher basal water content developed in AQP4(-/-) mouse brain, implying the same increment of water content over a higher basal level may provoke an even more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e>, which might be an important cause of increased mortality in AQP4(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, AQP4 knockout aggravated I/R injury with enlarged <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and a more serious loss of CA1 neurons accompanied by a striking <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of astrocytes, suggesting an involvement of AQP4 in astrocytic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide direct evidence that AQP4 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of I/R injury, which may confer a new option for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
