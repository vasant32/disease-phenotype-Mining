<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite apparent relationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase response (APR), considerable variation in the APR exists between individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed post-hoc analysis of individual APR profiles in 31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in relation to volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> had serial blood samples taken within 12 h, and up to 12 months of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, for analysis of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at 5 to 7 days (median 23.9 cm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase in plasma CRP after the admission sample was evident in 94% of patients by day 5 to 7 (median increase 558% of admission value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRP response, assessed as area under the curve between admission and day 5 to 7, correlated strongly (r=0.62, p&lt;0.001) with CT <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with greater <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes had more evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, either prior to or during the first week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of response was similar for IL-6, although only 77% showed an increase in plasma IL-6 after the admission sample (median increase 148% of admission value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and other factors may contribute to systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain injury after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is a major factor influencing the magnitude and variability of the APR </plain></SENT>
