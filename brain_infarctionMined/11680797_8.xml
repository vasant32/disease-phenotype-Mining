<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Variants of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) gene have been shown to influence serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and, as found recently, risk of clinical ischaemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we tested for an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and two common polymorphisms of the LPL gene, Ser447Ter and Asn291 Ser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: To avoid ascertainment and selection bias involved in many association studies, we compared the distribution of these polymorphisms in neuropathologically verified patients (n = 119) vs controls (n = 133) derived from a prospective, population-based study (the Vantaa 85+ study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LPL Ter447 variant was negatively associated with neuropathologically verified brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P = 0.006), and even more strongly with <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the Ter447 variant was associated with higher serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> chblesterol (P = 0.004) and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (P= 0.003), and that it was negatively associated with pathologically verified severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (P=0.001) in the Vantaa 85+ study sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Asn291Ser polymorphism was not significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Ter447 variant of LPL is associated with decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in our very elderly population </plain></SENT>
