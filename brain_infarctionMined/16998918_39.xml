<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several hypotheses to account for these therapeutic effects have been suggested, and current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233629" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">thinking</z:e> is that neuroprotection rather than neurogenesis is responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To enhance the therapeutic benefits of hMSCs potentially, we transfected hMSCs with the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene using a fiber-mutant F/RGD adenovirus vector and investigated whether GDNF gene-modified hMSCs (GDNF-hMSCs) could contribute to functional recovery in a rat permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We induced MCAO by using intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, and GDNF-hMSCs were intravenously infused into the rats 3 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI and behavioral analyses revealed that rats receiving GDNF-hMSCs or hMSCs exhibited increased recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with the control group, but the effect was greater in the GDNF-hMSC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results suggest that intravenous administration of hMSCs transfected with the GDNF gene using a fiber-mutant adenovirus vector may be useful in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and may represent a new strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
