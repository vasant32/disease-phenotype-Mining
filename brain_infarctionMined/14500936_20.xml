<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 175 first-ever LI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The group was divided according to the presence of multiple (n=136) or single (n=39) LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of single or multiple LI with the principal vascular risk factors, leukoaraiosis, outcome, and recurrence was investigated with logistic regression models that included age, sex, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found between single and multiple LI with respect to age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, smoking, and heavy alcohol drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95% CI, 1.09 to 5.4), high levels of hematocrit (&gt;0.47) (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.21), and leukoaraiosis (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.77 to 7.51) were significantly related to multiple but not to single LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was 7.7% in patients with single LI and 24.3% in the multiple LI group (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.1 to 13.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 6 to 156 months), 94% of the single LI patients and 77.2% of the multiple LI patients had favorable outcomes (Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.25 to 23.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, leukoaraiosis, and high levels of hematocrit are important risk factors in patients with &gt;1 LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple LI may be an important prognostic indicator not only for functional recovery but also for a higher rate of recurrence </plain></SENT>
