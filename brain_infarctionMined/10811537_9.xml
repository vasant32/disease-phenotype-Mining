<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We studied the relationship between the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy (ERT) and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities among older women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A population-based prospective study (Cardiovascular Health Study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Four regions in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2133 (62.9% of the eligible) women aged 65 to 95 years (mean age 74.8), on whom MRI was performed in 1992-1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Presence of global brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, white matter changes, small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesion (ILL) (&lt;3 mm), MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (&gt; or =3 mm, mostly small and asymptomatic), and cognitive function as measured by Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and by ERT use (current/past/never), adjusted for a number of socioeconomic, lifestyle, and reproductive covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Current use of ERT was reported by 15% and past use by another 23% of participants; 35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women had MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> did not differ in current or past users from those who had never used ERT (nonusers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bifrontal distance, the largest distance between frontal horns, and the size of ventricles were larger among current ERT users compared to past users or nonusers (P (trend) = .01), adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other covariates, but no dose-response relationship to current or past ERT use was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use was not associated with any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>Cortical atrophy</z:hpo> measure, sulcal widening, or white matter disease did not differ significantly by ERT use or duration of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Central measures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, bifrontal distance, and ventricular size were significantly associated with cognition as measured by MMSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current ERT users had much more clinically significant central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> than nonusers, but the implications remained unclear </plain></SENT>
