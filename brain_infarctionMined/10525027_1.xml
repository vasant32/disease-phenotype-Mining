<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To describe two variants of infarction within the temporal lobe, associated with local matrix <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and mild to moderate intraventricular haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The files of 10 neonates, extracted from a sonographic study of 560 very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> infants conducted between 1993 and 1997, were retrospectively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven lesions were located in the middle to posterior area of the temporal lobe, three others faced the atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except two of those with a temporal site were VLBW infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyaline membrane disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except for one fatal case, <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular bleeding</z:mp> was mild to moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomograms or magnetic resonance imaging were used to illustrate the haemorrhagic nature of three lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survivors of this so far undescribed entity who were followed up for more than 18 months did not have a uniform type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> but some scored in the low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range on the Bayley Mental Development Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One girl developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tle">temporal lobe epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pattern of injury seems to be one of venous infarction associated with temporal or para-atrial matrix haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The temporal site fits the picture of venous infarction within the area drained by the inferior ventricular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A less constant lateral atrial vein, either draining into the basal or internal cerebral vein, is probably involved in the para-atrial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sonography may be the only practical tool currently available for detection in life </plain></SENT>
