<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A hypoxic-ischemic origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010534'>transient global amnesia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) has been suggested on the basis of the observation of infarctlike diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) abnormalities in some affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis by comparing vascular risk factors, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of cerebral small-vessel disease, and other evidence of a cerebrovascular disorder between <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients with (DWI+) and without (DWI-) DWI lesions and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> community-based controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively identified 86 patients hospitalized for <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (mean+/-SD age, 65.9+/-10.9 years; 62% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI at 1.5 T was assessed for DWI lesions exhibiting restricted diffusion (ie, DWI+), white-matter hyperintensities, lacunes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (median time lag to clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 66.6+/-54.6 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors and findings from duplex sonography, ECG, and echocardiography were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 1:2 age- and sex-matched sample of 172 elderly subjects (mean+/-SD age, 65.6+/-9.3 years; 62% female) free of neuropsychiatric disease served for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWI lesions were observed in 10 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (11.5%; mean+/-SD age, 68.3+/-5.4 years; 8 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> small and located in the mesiotemporal region (9 left hemisphere, 5 right hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vascular risk profile of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients and concomitant changes on brain MRI were comparable with those of healthy controls and did not show significant differences between DWI+ and DWI- subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive diagnostic workup also provided no evidence for a higher rate of cerebrovascular disorder-related abnormalities in either the total group of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients or <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> DWI+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support a cerebrovascular etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, even in those individuals showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other pathophysiologic mechanisms need to be explored </plain></SENT>
