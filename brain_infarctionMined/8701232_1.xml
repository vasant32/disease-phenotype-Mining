<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral lesions of the cerebral auditory system influence the functional ear preference disclosed by dichotic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For that reason we have examined aphasic patients with recent, initial, unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> for ear preference with regard to dichotically presented two syllable words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a consecutive series of 114 patients who could cope with the test, 29 showed signs of an acquired left ear advantage (LEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were offered, and 22 accepted a full scale audiological examination including pure tone, speech and phase-audiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients showed retrocochlear or central hearing disturbances, which added to their communicative predicaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LEA of 11 patients lacked audiological rationales and a compensatory shift of cerebral speech-lateralization cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
