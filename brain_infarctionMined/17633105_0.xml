<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 64 year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of left <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp> after a lot of alcohol drink </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, his blood pressure was 96/43 mmHg, and heart rate was 97 beats/min and regular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His laboratory data showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and Hb was 5.0 g/dl due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His clinical condition indicated pre-shock and we began to give him a blood transfusion immediately after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His neurological findings on admission were mild consciousness disturbance without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, left unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e>, and mild monoparesis on left leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images demonstrated the small hyper-intense lesions in the borderzone area between the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed the occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was fully supplied through anterior communicating artery from the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) revealed the blunted waveform with low-resistance in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow wave in the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed him as having a hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> based on MRI and TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On day 5, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and pre-shock improved to Hb 8.2 g/dl and 148/78 mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to elevation of blood pressure, his neurological findings normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up TCD revealed that the abnormal waveform in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> changed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally we considered the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism of this case as hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serial TCD examinations are useful to identify the hemodynamic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in such case </plain></SENT>
