<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set up an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> injury by inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (for 1 h) followed by reperfusion (for 24 h) (CI/R) in rats to examine the protective effects and action mechanisms of dimemorfan against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with dimemorfan (1.0 microg/kg and 10 microg/kg, i.v.) either 15 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or at the time of reperfusion, like the putative sigma(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, PRE084 (10 microg/kg, i.v.), ameliorated the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone by 67-72% or 51-52%, respectively, which was reversed by pre-treatment with the selective sigma(1) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, BD1047 (20 microg/kg, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major pathological mechanisms leading to CI/R injury including excitotoxicity, oxidative/nitrosative stress, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> downstream events initiated by excessive accumulation of extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dimemorfan treatment (10 microg/kg, i.v., at the time of reperfusion) inhibited the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1beta, which occurred in parallel with decreases in neutrophil infiltration, activation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related signals (p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1), expression of neuronal and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, oxidative/nitrosative tissue damage (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and 8-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> formation), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ipsilateral cortex after CI/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dimemorfan treatment at the time of reperfusion, although did not prevent an early rise of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> level, significantly prevented subsequent <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> accumulation after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect was lasted for more than 4 h and was reversed by pre-treatment with BD1047 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that dimemorfan activates the sigma(1) receptor to reduce <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> accumulation and then suppresses initiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related events and signals as well as induction of oxidative and nitrosative stresses, leading to reductions in tissue damage and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that dimemorfan exhibits protective effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in CI/R rats probably through modulation of sigma(1) receptor-dependent signals to prevent subsequent <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> accumulation and its downstream pathologic events </plain></SENT>
