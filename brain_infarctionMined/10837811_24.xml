<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have shown that prior intracerebral infusion of a low dose of thrombin (thrombin preconditioning; TPC) reduces the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> that follows a subsequent intracerebral infusion of a high dose of thrombin or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies have also demonstrated that low concentrations of thrombin protect neurons and astrocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study, therefore, examines the hypothesis that TPC would offer protection from ischemic brain damage in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was a blinded design study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rat brain was preconditioned with 1 U thrombin by direct infusion into the left caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days after thrombin pretreatment, permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, neurological deficit was evaluated and infarction volume, brain water and ion contents were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to saline-treated rats, thrombin pretreatment significantly attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in cortex (90+/-33 vs. 273+/-22 mm(3); P&lt;0.05) and basal ganglia (56+/-17 vs. 119+/-12 mm(3); P&lt;0.05) that followed 24 h of permanent MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TPC also reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in cortex and basal ganglia by 50 and 53% (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit was improved in thrombin pretreatment group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects of TPC were, in part, prevented by co-injection of hirudin, a thrombin inhibitor, indicating that the protection was indeed thrombin mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral TPC significantly reduces ischemic brain damage, perhaps by activation of the thrombin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding provides a new mechanism by which to study ischemic tolerance </plain></SENT>
