<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 75-year-old man who had shown bilateral ballistic movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>pulmonary emphysema</z:hpo> for about 35 years and was treated with oxygen therapy 3 years before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When he was 70 years old, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> appeared in bilateral limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> were ballistic, and become gradually worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted MRI after admission demonstrated high signal intensities in the bilateral pallidum, indicating multiple brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography showed 2 plaques in the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory studies revealed blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medication with clonazepam and tiapride together with oxygen therapy normalized blood gas levels and improved his <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But after discharge, he stopped oxygen therapy and involuntary movement became worse again, associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> demonstrated by his blood gas analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that not only cerebrovascular disease but <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> might play an important role in the appearance and exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
