<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initially and at 1 week, the median 7 p.m. serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> values were statistically significantly higher in those with frontally extending <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in those with non-frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
