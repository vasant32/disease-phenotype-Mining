<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The regional evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was studied in Wistar rats submitted to remotely controlled thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusion was performed in the magnet of an NMR tomography system to allow continuous recording of diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 30 min (n = 6) or 2 h (n = 9), cerebral blood flow was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi> iodoantipyrine autoradiography while the regional distribution of ATP, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and pH was imaged using pictorial bioluminescence and fluoroscopic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In diffusion-weighted images, the hemispheric lesion area (HLA) at the level of caudate-putamen amounted to 54.2 +/- 10.9% after 30 min and to 67.0 +/- 5.9% after 2 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These areas corresponded to the regions exhibiting tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> (60.8 +/- 9.3% and 70.4 +/- 4.5%), but were clearly larger than those in which ATP was depleted (22.3 +/- 20.8% and 49.6 +/- 12.9% after 30 min and 2 h, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The threshold of blood flow for the increase of signal intensity in diffusion-weighted images increased between 30 min and 2 h occlusion from 34 to 41 ml/100 g per minute, the threshold of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> from 40 to 47 ml/100 g per minute, and the threshold for ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> from 13 to 19 ml/100 g per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that diffusion-weighted imaging detects both the core and the penumbra of the evolving infarction but is not able to differentiate between the two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It further shows that the ischemic lesion grows during the initial 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, and that the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core increases more rapidly than that of the penumbra </plain></SENT>
