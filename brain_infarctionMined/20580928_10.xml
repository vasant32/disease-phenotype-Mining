<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An involvement of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase Nox2 has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only little is known about the contribution of the Nox1 homologue in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we studied the role of Nox1 in early cerebral reperfusion injury in the middle cerebral artery filament occlusion model using Nox1 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic deletion of a functional Nox1 lead to a 55% attenuation in lesion size at 24h after induction of 1h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result was paralleled by a significant improvement of neurological outcome, preservation of blood-brain barrier integrity and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in Nox1(y/)(-) compared to WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size between WT and Nox1(y/)(-) was observed with an occlusion time of 2h and longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> rate as measured by TUNEL staining was similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, infusion of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> TEMPOL as well as of the unspecific NO-synthase inhibitor l-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> elicited similar changes with respect to ischemic tissue damage between WT and Nox1-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Nox1 is involved in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data however indicate that ROS-mediated direct cellular injury is unlikely to explain the protective effect achieved by genetic deletion of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
