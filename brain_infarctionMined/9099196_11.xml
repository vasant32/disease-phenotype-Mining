<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) and cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) coexist and therefore reflect a generalized pattern of atherosclerotic disease in an individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the known deleterious effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> on cognitive function, it was hypothesized that patients with PVD may have impaired cerebral function due to concomitant but clinically unrecognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether neuropsychological tests would reveal this potential dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neuropsychological test scores (n = 25) were compared across three groups: (1) 29 PVD patients (13 amputees, 16 nonamputees), (2) 29 age- and education-matched patients with atherothrombotic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (ie, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), and (3) 30 age- and education-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PVD patients performed significantly worse (P &lt; .002) than control subjects on eight neuropsychological measures of executive function, attention, and visuopatial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern and, in certain instances, the magnitude of impairment was highly similar between PVD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis revealed that PVD severity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> were significant negative predictors of test performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and atherosclerotic risk factors did not explain neuropsychological deficits after the effects of PVD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PVD patients exhibit neuropsychological deficits that suggest the presence of mild vascular-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple manifestations of generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ie, severe PVD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>) appear to be particularly at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be alert to these potential deficits and to the possibility of further vascular-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
