<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The vascularization of neural grafts in ischemic brain was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats grafted with a suspension of fetal neocortical tissue into the infarcted area five to six days after ligation of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain vasculature was examined by scanning electron microscopy of corrosion vascular casts and the cortical microvasculature was stereologically quantified in light microscopy three months after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patent anastomoses were present between the middle cerebral artery distal to occlusion and the proximal part, as well as to the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries, in both grafted and non-grafted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A vascular plexus covering the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cavities and the grafts contained leptomeningeal vessels intermingled with a thin capillary network which is not normally found on the brain surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The graft vessels were derived from this vascular plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regular pattern of arterioles and venules penetrating from the cortical surface in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neocortex was absent in the grafts but the capillary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was similar in both types of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The grafts had a lower capillary density than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue and lacked the laminar distribution of capillaries characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate the plasticity of the vascular system where remodeling of the vascular tree after an ischemic insult provides suitable conditions for the vascularization of neocortical grafts </plain></SENT>
