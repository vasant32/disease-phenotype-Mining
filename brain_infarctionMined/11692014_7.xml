<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Only a small percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients receive thrombolytic therapy because of time constraints and the risks associated with thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT (XeCT) cerebral blood flow (CBF) and/or CT angiography (CTA) in conjunction with CT can distinguish subgroups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> victims and thereby better predict the subgroups most likely to benefit and not to benefit from thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An analysis of 51 patients who had a CT, CTA, and stable XeCT CBF examination within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These initial radiographic studies and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score on admission were assessed to determine whether they could predict new infarction on follow-up CT or discharge disposition by use of the Fisher exact test to determine statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with no infarction on initial CT and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> XeCT CBF had significantly fewer new infarctions and were discharged home more often than those with compromised CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same held true for patients with an open internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery by CTA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT compared with those with an occluded internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral artery by CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Either was superior to CT and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale in prediction of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both enable the selection of a group of patients not identifiable by CT alone that would do well without being exposed to the risks of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study included too few patients to statistically assess the role of combining CTA and XeCT CBF information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CT, CTA, and Xe/CT CBF does define potentially significant subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The utility of this classification is supported by the observation that CTA and XeCT CBF are superior to CT alone in predicting infarction on follow-up CT and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This information may be useful in selecting patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
