<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic arch plaques &amp;#x2265;4 mm are present in 1/3 of patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which account for 1/3 of the total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> population aged &amp;#x2265;60 years who had 1 or several vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The attributable risk of such plaques is 12.6% (95% confidence interval 7.6 to 17.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several longitudinal studies have shown an increased risk of recurrent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and peripheral emboli (relative risk from 1.7 to 4.3 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This means that the etiologic part and the overall vascular risk of aortic arch plaques &amp;#x2265;4 mm may be as high as nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or severe stenosis of internal carotid artery origin </plain></SENT>
