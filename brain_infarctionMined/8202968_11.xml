<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a group of patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, we prospectively determined the prevalence and radiological characteristics of clinically asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> evident on computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors and extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients randomized into the Asymptomatic Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study (ACAS) underwent a neurological history, a detailed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> questionnaire, and a detailed neurological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans were examined by standardized criteria developed as part of a quality-control program supervised by a neuroradiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence, location, and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> evident by computed tomography were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1132 patients, 848 had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-six patients (15%) had a silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; 95 (11%) had one, 24 (3%) had two, and 7 (1%) had three or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was small and deep for 117 patients (72%), less than one-half lobe for 45 (28%), and one-half to less than one lobe for 1 (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were evenly distributed ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the study artery but were significantly more frequent in the right hemisphere (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with silent infarction were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>abnormal gait</z:hpo> (P &lt; .001), abnormal deep tendon reflexes or plantar responses (P = .038), but not degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Silent infarction was less frequent among this totally asymptomatic cohort (15%) compared with those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (34/139, 25%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Silent infarction in the setting of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is not uncommon, but silent infarctions are rarely sizable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in patients with asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> has yet to be established </plain></SENT>
