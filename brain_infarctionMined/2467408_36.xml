<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many potential free radical-generating systems exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary products of these reactions, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, may combine to produce <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the many potential sources of free radical generation, the enzyme <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase has been shown to be important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in noncerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> scavenger dimethylthiourea and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35634">xanthine oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in a model of continuous partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with dimethylthiourea or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> before middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured by triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining of brains removed 3 or 24 hours after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volume was reduced by 30% after dimethylthiourea treatment and by 32-35% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cortical tissue was more effectively protected than caudate tissue with both agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with dimethylthiourea and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> also significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> formation and improved blood-brain barrier function as measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results imply that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> are important in tissue injury secondary to partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase may be the primary source of these radicals </plain></SENT>
