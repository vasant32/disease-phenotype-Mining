<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aspirin resistance was assessed by thrombelastography in 45 people with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 25 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was assessed using the modified Rankin scale and National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Score within 72 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aspirin resistance was more common in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than the control group (67% versus 40%, P=0.028), and within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group the aspirin-resistant group had a higher Rankin score (4.0 versus 2.0, P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aspirin resistance was greater in lacunar than embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (platelet activation 79% versus 59%, P=0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> aspirin-resistant group had higher levels of IL-6 than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> aspirin-sensitive group (2.4+/-1 versus 1.8+/-0.9 ng/mL, P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis, we examined the interrelationships between aspirin resistance, IL-6, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These analyses showed that IL-6 was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity as the outcome (B=3.738, P=0.036), and aspirin resistance was independently associated with IL-6 (B=0.765, P=0.005) as the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aspirin resistance is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and aspirin resistance is more common in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> than embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
