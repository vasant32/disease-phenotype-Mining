<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In healthy elderly people, silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (SBIs) have been recognized as common lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the association between SBI located outside the perforating artery territory (PAT) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> detected by agitated saline transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective observational study undertaken by a university health promotion center for healthy subjects and by a university <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined SBI as evidence on fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of one or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, without history of corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects the neuroimaging indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> leukoaraiosis (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01429948 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst 1103 consecutive healthy adults who underwent MRI, 347 (31%) had one or more SBIs located outside the PAT, suggesting embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Amongst them, 253 subjects underwent agitated saline TCD monitoring and 128 (51%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunts</z:hpo> (RLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of RLS was similar to cryptogenic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (62.0%, P = 0.056), but higher than in patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (36.2%, P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Amongst subjects with SBI, absence of LA was the only factor associated with RLS (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.01-3.14; P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> may play an important role in the development of SBI outside the PAT in apparently healthy adults </plain></SENT>
