<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, hydroxyfasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, was found to improve the learning and memory performance significantly in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> after permanent bilateral carotid artery ligation (BCAL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was observed by the administration of hydroxyfasudil (1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, once per day for 30 days) to ischemic rats and the measurements of escape latency and time spent in the target quadrant among the ischemic, sham, and ischemic plus hydroxyfasudil rats by the method of <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) In electrophysiological study, hydroxyfasudil abolished the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, it also markedly reduced pathological changes such as neuronal cells loss and nuclei shrinkage in cortex and hippocampus of ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis showed that the inhibition of Rho-kinase by hydroxyfasudil reduced the amount of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and increased the activities of SOD and GPx in ischemic rats that had increased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and decreased SOD and GPx activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) To explore mechanism (s) of the beneficial effects of hydroxyfasudil in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we performed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analyses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> NR2B subunit and for the first time found that hydroxyfasudil increased the expression of NR2B in cortex and hippocampus at both protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4) Taken together, our data further support the notion that the inhibition of Rho-kinase provides neuroprotective effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
