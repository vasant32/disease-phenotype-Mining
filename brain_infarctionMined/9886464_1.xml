<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent standardised evaluations including standard questionnaires, a physical and neurological examination, cognitive function tests, electrocardiogram, a complete blood chemistry panel, and plasma amino acid measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, deep white matter lesions (DWMLs), and periventricular hyperintensities were found in 26%, 43%, and 29% of the 178 participants, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with DWMLs were significantly older and had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, higher systolic blood pressure, and more brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but lower plasma concentrations of tryptophan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate model, greater age and lower plasma tryptophan concentrations were independently associated with DWMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tryptophan concentrations were inversely related to DWML grading, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were more common in subjects with higher extents of DWMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that greater age and lower plasma tryptophan concentrations were important in producing DWMLs in elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
