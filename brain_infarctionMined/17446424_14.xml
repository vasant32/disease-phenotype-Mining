<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of subcortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> in this process remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between cerebral volume and different types of subcortical MRI lesions in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 147 patients with CADASIL recruited from a prospective cohort study were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validated methods were used to determine the ratio of brain volume to intracranial cavity volume (brain parenchymal fraction [BPF]), volume of white matter hyperintensities, volume of lacunar lesions, number of cerebral microhemorrhages, and mean apparent diffusion coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between BPF, clinical scales, and the different subcortical MRI markers were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BPF obtained in 129 patients was significantly associated with the Mattis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating scale (P&lt;0.0001), Mini-Mental State Examination (P=0.002), and modified Rankin scale (P&lt;0.0001) after adjustment for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression modeling showed that BPF was independently associated with mean apparent diffusion coefficient (P&lt;0.0001), volume of lacunar lesions (P=0.004), and age (P&lt;0.0001), accounting for 46% of the observed variance in BPF but not with volume of white matter hyperintensities or number of microhemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In association with age, mean apparent diffusion coefficient and volume of lacunar lesions are strong and independent MRI predictors of BPF, a key marker of cognitive and motor disability in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is related to remote and/or diffuse consequences of both lacunar lesions and widespread microstructural alterations within the brain outside lacunar lesions </plain></SENT>
