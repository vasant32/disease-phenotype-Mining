<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Dizziness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> are important public heath care issues especially in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isolated dizziness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> without neurological deficits has seldom been considered a symptom/sign due to vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, some studies have suggested that vascular origin should be considered in cases of positional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> or dizziness when the etiology remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tried to delineate the correlation of dizziness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected adult subjects receiving health screening of the brain at their own expense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had undergone brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and carotid duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chief complaints, body height, body weight, waist circumference and blood pressure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most received blood tests including fasting sugar, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationships between dizziness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and blood test data, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, carotid duplex, silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, leukoaraiosis and MRA were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After exclusion, a total of 170 out of 210 subjects were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed that dizziness/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> had a significant correlation to age, UA , BMI, male <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and female waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among them, female waist circumference had the highest statistical significance (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis on brain MRI also had a close relationship with dizziness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After careful examination and approach, a vascular origin should be considered in dizzy patients of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
