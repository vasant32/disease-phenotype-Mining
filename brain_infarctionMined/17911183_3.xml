<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) lack traditional risk factors, suggesting that other factors (including infectious agents) might contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096584" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chlamydia pneumoniae infection</z:e> in a large cohort of patients with BI according to aetiological subtypes and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured serum IgG and IgA to C. pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence in 483 BI cases and 483 controls matched for age, sex and centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG &gt; or = 1/32 and IgA &gt; or = 1/24 were considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases with BI proven by magnetic resonance imaging were consecutively recruited and were classified into aetiological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (intima-media thickness, plaques, stenosis) was evaluated by duplex ultrasonography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects following the same method and with central reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: C. pneumoniae IgG seropositivity was not associated with BI (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.51) and did not increase the risk of any aetiological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, C. pneumoniae IgA was not associated with BI (adjusted OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.84-2.81), but there was a significant interaction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgA seropositivity increased the BI risk in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (adjusted OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.15 to 6.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When stratifying BI into subtypes, IgA seropositivity increased the risk of BI of unknown cause, but without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was neither association with atherothrombotic, lacunar and cardioembolic BI nor with carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaques or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that C. pneumoniae seropositivity is associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and BI, regardless of aetiological subtype; but it might be associated with an increased risk of BI in normotensive patients </plain></SENT>
