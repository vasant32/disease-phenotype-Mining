<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The establishment of a quantitative relationship among them would further strengthen this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the frequency and the number of MBs in patients hospitalized with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and their quantitative relationship with the severity of white matter changes (WMC) and the number of old lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a hospital-based survey of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of MBs, number of old lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on T2-weighted imaging and the severity of WMC on MRI on admission were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MBs were detected in 22 (27%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of MBs ranged from 1 to 42 (mean 6.59, median 3) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations among the number of MBs, extent of WMC and number of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>: lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and MBs (r = 0.297, p = 0.007); lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and WMC (r = 0.331, p = 0.002); WMC and MBs (r = 0.522, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
