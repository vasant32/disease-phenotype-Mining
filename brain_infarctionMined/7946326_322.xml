<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Naturally occurring cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (NOCD) is a prominent feature of the developing <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this process, neurons express bcl-2, a major regulator of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> whose expression may determine whether a neuron dies or survives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the possible role of bcl-2 during NOCD in vivo, we generated lines of transgenic mice in which neurons overexpress the human BCL-2 protein under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 overexpression reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> during the NOCD period, which led to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For instance, the facial nucleus and the ganglion cell layer of the retina had, respectively, 40% and 50% more neurons than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this finding, more axons than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> were found in the facial and optic nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also tested whether neurons overexpressing BCL-2 were more resistant to permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; in transgenic mice, the volume of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was reduced by 50% as compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These animals represent an invaluable tool for studying the effects of increased neuronal numbers on brain function as well as the mechanisms that control the survival of neurons during development and adulthood </plain></SENT>
