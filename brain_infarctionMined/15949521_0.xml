<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is thought to result from a lesion in a specific network, reflecting the organization of our semantic knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deficit usually involves multiple semantic categories whose profile of naming deficit generally obeys the animate/inanimate dichotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thalamic lesions cause general semantic naming deficit, and only rarely a category specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0454582" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">semantic deficit</z:e> for very limited and highly specific categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control study on a 56-year-old right-handed man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo> following a left anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His naming ability and semantic knowledge were evaluated in the visual, tactile and auditory modalities for stimuli from 11 different categories, and compared to that of five controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In naming to visual stimuli the patient performed poorly (error rate&gt;50%) in four categories: vegetables, toys, animals and body parts (average 70.31+/-15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each category there was a different dominating error type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He performed better in the other seven categories (tools, clothes, transportation, fruits, electric, furniture, kitchen utensils), averaging 14.28+/-9% errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed a dichotomy between naming in animate and inanimate categories in the visual and tactile modalities but not in response to auditory stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, a unique category specific profile of response and naming errors to visual and tactile, but not auditory stimuli was found after a left anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This might reflect the role of the thalamus not only as a relay station but further as a central integrator of different stages of perceptual and semantic processing </plain></SENT>
