<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex produces motor evoked potentials (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides this excitatory response, TMS has inhibitory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When TMS is performed during voluntary muscle contraction, the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> is followed by a pause in electromyographic activity (cortical silent period, SP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the SP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied SP changes in 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A stimulator with a round coil and a fixed intensity of 90% of maximum was used to evoke <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SP was elicited on the affected side in 29 of the 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean SP duration was markedly longer on the affected side in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between left and right sides in the means of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> amplitude ratio (amplitude related to corresponding amplitudes to peripheral electric stimulation) and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> latencies in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prolonged SP was found in 25 of the 29 patients (86%) whereas only 4 (14%) had abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> latency or amplitude ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean SP duration was significantly prolonged also in a subgroup of 14 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hand function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The SP measurement is an easily performed and sensitive method to detect even subclinical disturbances in motor system function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
