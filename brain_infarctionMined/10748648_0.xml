<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic mechanisms were grouped according to the Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TOAST system settles five pathogenetic diagnosis: 1) Large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LM); 2) Cardioembolism (CE); 3) Small <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (SAO); 4) Other etiologies (SOE); 5) Undetermined pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As regards the site, the patients were divided into the following groups: Posterior Circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> (POCI) 8.6%, Total Anterior Circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> (TACI) 19.8%, Partial Anterior Circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> (PACI) 29.6%, Lacunar Anterior Circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> (LACI) 30.9%, Multiple Site <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A probable or certain diagnosis was issued only in 33.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was not complete in 22.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That was due either to the severe clinical status or the patient and his relatives' refusal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the incomplete diagnosis occurred in TACI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The undetermined pathogenesis due to absent clues occurred in 18.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CE often brought about TACI, whereas LM was likely to provoke PACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SOE, like systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, brought about Multiple Site <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately assessing the pathogenetic diagnosis is still a controversial issue and TOAST method itself is not satisfactory as an overall classification system </plain></SENT>
