<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these effects can be ameliorated by transplantation (TX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cause and nature of the underlying brain injury is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study on a group of children after TX to look for brain abnormalities and, if possible, to draw conclusions about their origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three children who received a renal allograft before 5 yr of age were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common diagnosis was the congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> of Finnish type (29 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The male/female ratio was 22/11, the age range 6-11 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-TX CT studies of 26 patients were available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient files were studied for relevant clinical history, including pre- and perinatal events, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, hypertensive crises, hypovolemic states and medical emergencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These risk factors were correlated with the MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (54%) had ischemic lesions in the vascular border zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mild lesions were seen in 10 patients, moderate in six and severe in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other findings were rare, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the main vascular territories and basal ganglia, and central and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pre-TX CT's revealed border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic crises were reported in 14 patients and correlated well with border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The age at TX was greater and the duration of dialysis longer in those with border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Low gestational age, perinatal complications, and septic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were not statistically significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because of the lack on serial imaging studies we do not know the exact timing of these brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The good correlation to pre-TX hemodynamic crises seems, however, to indicate that most of these lesions could be prevented by careful clinical monitoring and early TX </plain></SENT>
