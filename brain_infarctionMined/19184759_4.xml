<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genotypes of 70 patients and 81 healthy controls were determined through PCR with or without RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) was performed to assess endothelial-dependent vasodilatation, whereas the endothelial-independent vasodilatation was assessed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> (NTG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype distribution was significantly different between LI patients and controls for intron 4aa (alleles for four repeats), genotype frequency being 1.4% and 16.0%, respectively (odds ratio for additive effect, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81; p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes with the intron 4aa polymorphism were significantly higher in controls when compared with the LI group (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diminished FMD but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NTG response confirmed that patients with LI have generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intron 4aa genotype of eNOS gene seems to be protective for isolated LI and the effect was potentiated by the absence of 786C polymorphism in any allele of the promoter region </plain></SENT>
