<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data are lacking regarding the prognostic significance of variability in BP measured during office visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the relationship between office BP variability and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in elderly patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who experienced their first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the age of 60 years or over were registered in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At least 2 sex- and age-matched control patients were registered for each case patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Office BP at each clinic visit and known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BP variability was defined as the variation coefficient (VC) of office BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this report, we analyze the data of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VC of both systolic and diastolic BPs was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> patients than in the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher office BP variability was associated with a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after adjustment for BP level and other confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding diastolic BP, the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with the maximal value for the difference of office BPs taken at any consecutive two visits (Max-deltaBP) or the difference between the highest and lowest values of office BP (BP-range) recorded during a 1-year period prior to the event was also significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a retrospective case-control study suggested that office BP variability was an independent predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Either the Max-deltaBP or the BP-range may be surrogate indices of diastolic BP variability </plain></SENT>
