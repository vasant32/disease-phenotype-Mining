<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Consumers of light-to-moderate amounts of alcohol have a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and, possibly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> than do abstainers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> may contribute to symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, reduction of cerebrovascular disease in consumers of light amounts of alcohol could account for that observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a low concentration of alcohol may also have direct effects on the hippocampus, a brain structure highly affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated alcohol intake in relation to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of presumed vascular origin (ie, white matter lesions and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) and findings more specifically found in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (ie, hippocampal and amygdalar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In a population-based sample of 1074 older persons without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (aged 60-90 y), we made brain MRIs from which we rated white matter lesions and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 509 people, hippocampal and amygdalar volumes on MRI were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alcohol intake was assessed by using a structured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We categorized alcohol intake as lifetime abstention and very light (&lt;1 drink/wk), light (&gt;/=1 drink/wk to &lt;1 drink/d), moderate (&gt;/=1 drink/d to &lt;4 drinks/d), and heavy (&gt;/=4 drinks/d) intakes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Persons whose alcohol consumption was light to moderate had less severe white matter lesions and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI than did abstainers or heavy drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abstainers and very light drinkers had smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volumes on MRI than did light-to-moderate drinkers, but only if the former carried an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (APOE) epsilon4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Light-to-moderate alcohol intake is associated with a lower prevalence of vascular brain findings and, in APOE epsilon4 carriers, hippocampal and amygdalar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on MRI </plain></SENT>
