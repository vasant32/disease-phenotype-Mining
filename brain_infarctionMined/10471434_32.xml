<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been shown to involve reorganization in motor and premotor cortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether poststroke recovery also depends on changes in remote brain structures, ie, diaschisis, is as yet unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we studied regional cerebral blood flow in 7 patients (mean+/-SD age, 54+/-8 years) after their first hemiparetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed imaging data voxel by voxel using a principal component analysis by which coherent changes in functional networks could be disclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performance was assessed by a motor score and by the finger movement rate during the regional cerebral blood flow measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients had recovered (P&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>001) from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after on average 6 months and were able to perform sequential finger movements with the recovered hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow at rest differentiated patients and controls (P&lt;0.05) by a network that was affected by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During blindfolded performance of sequential finger movements, patients were differentiated from controls (P&lt;0.05) by a recovery-related network and a movement-control network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These networks were spatially incongruent, involving motor, sensory, and visual cortex of both cerebral hemispheres, the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lesion-affected and recovery-related networks overlapped in the contralesional thalamus and extrastriate occipital cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Motor recovery after hemiparetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> is subserved by brain structures in locations remote from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The topographic overlap of the lesion-affected and recovery-related networks suggests that diaschisis may play a critical role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
