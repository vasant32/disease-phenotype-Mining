<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: It is well established that the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign is a specific marker for early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the hyperdense basilar artery sign (HDBA) in posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine whether the HDBA sign has utility in early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and prediction of short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three-blinded readers examined unenhanced computed tomography scans for the HDBA sign, and materials were classified into two groups according to this sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors, admission and discharge National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores, short-term outcome, and radiological findings between the two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (PCS) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found in risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, except <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Admission and discharge NIHSS scores for the positive HDBA group were significantly higher than scores for the negative HDBA group (P=0.001, 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The infarction territory for the positive HDBA group was mainly multi-region in nature (51.6%, P&lt;0.001), while the negative HDBA group showed mainly middle territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant independent predictors of short-term outcome included the HDBA sign (P&lt;0.001) and admission NIHSS scores (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the HDBA patients showed multi-region infarction and a serious neurological symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, this sign might not only be helpful in early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PCS but also be able to correlate with a poor short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
