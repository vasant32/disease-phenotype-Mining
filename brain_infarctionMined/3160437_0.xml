<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracerebral distribution of microspheres and regional cerebral blood flow were measured bilaterally in 8 brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In control rats, increase in arterial pCO2 to about 80 mm Hg resulted in 30 to 100% increase in flow according to the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was also enhanced in the embolized rats, the basal values being multiplied by a factor 1.7 in the embolized hemisphere and by a factor 1.8 in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results do not provide evidence for the existence of a "steal" phenomenon between the non infarcted and infarcted hemispheres </plain></SENT>
