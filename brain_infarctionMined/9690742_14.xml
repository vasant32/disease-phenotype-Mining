<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between amino acid efflux and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was compared in different periods during MHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reversible middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats using a suture model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided into four groups including (1) MHT during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (MHTi), (2) MHT during reperfusion (MHTr), (3) MHT during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (MHTi + r), and (4) a normothermic group (NT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine in the cortex and striatum were monitored using in vivo microdialysis and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphometric measurements for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were performed using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine in the ischemic cortex of the MHTi and MHTi + r rats during ischemic and reperfusion periods was significantly less than that of the NT rats (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistical difference among these groups in the peak of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine release in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume paralleled the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of MHTi and MHTi + r in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion brain injury may be due to the attenuation of both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine release during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
