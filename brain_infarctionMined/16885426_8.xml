<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors set out to demonstrate the feasibility of using fMRI to investigate mechanisms of recovery in individual patients presenting with severe motor impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: fMRI was performed during passive movement at both affected and unaffected wrists separately in 2 patients with pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six scanning sessions were performed in each patient over the first 4 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven control subjects were also studied, 1 of them over 6 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors examined for longitudinal changes in cerebral responses to proprioceptive afferent input that correlated with motor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In control subjects, passive movement of either wrist led to relative increases in brain activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area, the bilateral inferior parietal cortex and secondary somatosensory areas, and the ipsilateral cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increases in brain activation correlating with motor recovery were observed in both the ipsilesional primary sensory and primary motor cortex in 1 patient with good motor recovery but not in another patient with poor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No longitudinal changes were seen in the control subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These 2 case reports demonstrate that functionally relevant changes in cerebral organization can be identified in individual patients </plain></SENT>
