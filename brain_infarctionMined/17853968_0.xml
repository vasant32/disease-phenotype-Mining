<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> of the brainstem has hardly been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its frequency is probably underestimated due to their briefness and that they are often misinterpreted as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their pathophysiological mechanism is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms, such as the existence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-generating brainstem center, capable of generating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> activity or the interruption of the corticospinal tracts due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: We present three patients with disease of the basilar artery and extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> who have the presentation of sudden, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> in limbs in the initial phase, in paroxysms of short duration and of varied semiology in common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We described this in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An electroencephalographic functional study during these episodes was done in one of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of conscious level, its variability of presentation, the null response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs and normality of the electroencephalogram in one of them leads us to ratify the hypothesis of failure of the cortical inhibitory projections as subcortical centers in trunk or spinal cord as pathophysiological origin of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We stress the importance of recognizing these clinical manifestations of appearance in the initial phases of the disease, that permit a rapid diagnosis with the help of the transcranial Doppler to establish an early and aggressive treatment of this disease having known seriousness and bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies would be interesting to know what the real incidence of these movements is, and functional ones to clarify the pathophysiological nature of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
