<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In response to passive heating, adults with hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> demonstrate lower skin temperatures (Tsk) and higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> rates (SR) on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether children with similar conditions demonstrate a similar response and whether this response is advantageous to defending body temperature during exercise in the heat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether children with spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> (CP) demonstrate less thermal strain than healthy peers during short (10 min each) bouts of arm cranking, a mode of exercise where metabolic rate can be matched between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven young people (8.3-18.3 yr) with spastic CP and 11 individually matched (body size, age, and maturity) healthy controls (CON) performed 3 x 10-min arm-cranking bouts (40 rpm) in 35 degrees C, 50% RH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body mass, metabolic and heart rate (HR) responses, and body temperatures were periodically measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals within each CP-CON pair worked at the same intensity (0.55 +/- 0.18 W.kg-1 body mass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA (alpha = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with CP showed no difference from CON in metabolic and HR responses, or SR (as inferred from body mass changes corrected for fluid intake and output) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were also no differences between the groups in the rectal temperature change from room temperature (21-23 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in Tsk from room temperature, however, was slightly (0.6 degrees C) but significantly lower (P &lt; 0.0001; 95% CI = 0.5-0.7 degrees C) in the subjects with CP compared with CON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subjects with CP demonstrate thermal strain responses similar to CON during upper-body exercise at relatively low intensities for short duration in a warm climate </plain></SENT>
