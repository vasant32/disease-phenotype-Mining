<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recent publication guidelines suggest that there are treatment strategies for optimizing the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients including thrombolytic therapy, antiplatelet drugs and the establishment of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Thailand, the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit has been established since May 1997 and was named Siriraj <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit (SASU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors retrospectively analyzed the data of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who were admitted in the SASU from May 1997 to May 2007, as well as hyper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (within 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 11.0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were as follow: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (61.79%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (35.47%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> (46.58%), smoking (21.02%) and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (23.74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 3.4% mainly due <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> (26 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean total hospital stay of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients at the SASU was 13.81 days (ranging from 1-120 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were thirty hyper-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy (between August 2005 and May 2007) for which the mean age was 70.7 years (ranges 48-88 years, median 74.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was 14.27 </plain></SENT>
