<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 68-year-old man who had been treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> for 27 years suffered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and was treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After this treatment, other new infarctions occurred in multiple organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because serum antibodies against <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> complex were detected, he was diagnosed as having HIT, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and argatroban were administered instead of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case in which organization and frequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16113">cholesterin</z:chebi> deposition were found in thromboembolized lesions of multiple organs after relatively long-term follow up, is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that HIT accompanied by marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> of long duration contributes to a characteristic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> that needs careful management </plain></SENT>
