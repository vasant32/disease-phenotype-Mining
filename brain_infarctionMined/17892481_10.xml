<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed that following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, patients show early elevations of plasma neopterin, S100B and peroxidation markers, the latter two correlating with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume assessed from computed tomography (CT) scans, and being consistent with a rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> pathway of tryptophan metabolism was also activated, with an increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> : tryptophan ratio, but with a highly significant decrease in the ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15793">3-hydroxyanthranilic acid</z:chebi> : <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30754">anthranilic acid</z:chebi>, which was strongly correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18344">kynurenic acid</z:chebi> were significantly raised in patients who died within 21 days compared with those who survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that increased tryptophan catabolism is initiated before or immediately after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and is related to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, with a major change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15793">3-hydroxyanthranilic acid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together with previous evidence that inhibiting the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> pathway reduces brain damage in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and that increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> metabolism directly promotes <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, it is proposed that oxidative tryptophan metabolism may contribute to the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and brain damage following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some form of anti-inflammatory intervention between the rise of S100B and the activation of microglia, including inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> pathway, may be valuable in modifying patient morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
