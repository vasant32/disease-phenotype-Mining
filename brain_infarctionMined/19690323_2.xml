<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The impact of single and combined effects of subcortical white matter lesions (WMLs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on activities of daily living (ADL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and health status perception was analyzed in community-dwelling elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 268 participants from the Memory and Morbidity in Augsburg Elderly (MEMO) project, a population-based study on individuals aged 65 to 83 years, conducted in Augsburg, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI was performed, and 2 geriatric performance tests, scales to assess ADL, depressive symptoms, and self-perceived health status were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of large (&gt;10 mm) subcortical WML was 37.7% and of MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions was 15.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both vascular lesion types combined were found in 9% of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large WMLs were associated with significantly more impairments in basic ADL, inferior results in the performance tests, and a worse self-perceived health status compared to those without large WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was associated with impairments in performance tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with both lesion types were limited in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains and were 2 to 3 times more likely to have impairments in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their risk of impairment in a specific function was considerably higher than the sum of the single risks associated with each lesion type alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the single and especially the combined occurrence of common vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> are associated with functional impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identifying individuals with severe WML combined with MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> can help better understand the development of marked impairments in old age </plain></SENT>
