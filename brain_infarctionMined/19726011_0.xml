<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by non-invasive cerebral electrical impedance (CEI) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An invariable secure current at a frequency of 50 kHz and an intensity of 0.1 mA was given into a person's brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CEI values of the bilateral hemisphere of 200 healthy volunteers and 107 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were measured by non-invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> monitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of perturbative index (PI) converted from CEI were compared with the volumes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, which were calculated by an image analysing system according to magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) In the healthy volunteers, PI values in the left and right hemisphere were 7.98 +/- 0.95 and 8.02 +/- 0.71 respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two sides (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, gender and different measuring times did not obviously affect PI values (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> group, CEI measurements were more sensitive to the volumes of lesion, which were more than 20 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive ratio of PI was higher when the volumes of infarction were &gt;20 ml (80.0%): the ratio of PI was 75.9% when the volumes of infarction were 20-50 ml and it was 83.3% when the volumes of lesion were more than 50 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PI was lower when the volumes were less than 20 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) PI of the infarction side increased obviously 3-5 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; the difference of two sides was the most significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between PI of the infarction side and volume of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PI may be a sensitive parameter for non-invasive monitoring of the change of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CEI is a valuable method for the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
