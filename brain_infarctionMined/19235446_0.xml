<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current cognitive models propose that multiple processes are involved in reading and writing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to use linguistic analyses to clarify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> behind two classic alexic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report four experiments on two patients, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010523'>alexia</z:hpo> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001825" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">agraphia</z:e> following occipitotemporal lesions, and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010523'>alexia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001825" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">agraphia</z:e> from a left angular gyral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient with occipital lesions had trouble discriminating real letters from foils and his reading varied with word-length but not with linguistic variables such as part of speech, word frequency or imageability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He read pseudo-words and words with regular spelling better, indicating preserved use of grapheme-to-phoneme pronunciation rules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His writing showed errors that reflected reliance on 'phoneme-to-grapheme' spelling rules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the patient with a left angular gyral lesion showed better recognition of letters, words and their meanings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His reading was better for words with high imageability but displayed semantic errors and an inability to use 'grapheme-to-phoneme' rules, features consistent with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>His <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001825" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">agraphia</z:e> showed impaired access to both an internal lexicon and 'phoneme-to-grapheme' rules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Some cases of pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0010523'>alexia</z:hpo> may be a perceptual word-form <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo>, with loss of internal representations of letters and words, while the angular gyral syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010523'>alexia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001825" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">agraphia</z:e> is a linguistic deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001825" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">agraphia</z:e> does not always distinguish between the two; rather, writing can mirror the reading deficits, being more obvious and profound in the case of an angular gyral syndrome </plain></SENT>
