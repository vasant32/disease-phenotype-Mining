<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MBs were found in 23 (77%) patients with BD, 26 (51%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e>, and 5 (8%) controls, and the incidence and the number of MBs were significantly greater in the BD group compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD had a more widespread location of MBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More specifically, MBs were commonly found in areas within or surrounded by white matter lesions of the patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When 81 patients from both the BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> groups were analyzed, logistic regression analysis showed that number of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, severity of white matter hyperintensity, and use of antiplatelet agents were significantly associated with MBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD exhibited a high frequency and number of MBs, indicating advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-prone <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> within the brain, which should be taken into account in treatment and management </plain></SENT>
