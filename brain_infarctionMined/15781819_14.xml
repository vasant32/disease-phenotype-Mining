<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent findings argue for a pathway in humans for sensing the orientation of gravity and controlling upright body posture, separate from the one for orientation perception of the visual world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients with contraversive pushing were shown to experience their body as oriented upright when actually tilted about 20 degrees to the ipsilesional side, in spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual-vestibular functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A recent study suggested the involvement of posterolateral thalamus typically associated with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between pushing behavior and thalamic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 3-year period the authors prospectively investigated 40 patients with left- or right-sided thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent showed contraversive pushing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors found a strong relationship between etiology, vascular territory, lesion size, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> associated with contraversive pushing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pusher patients had larger lesions that typically were caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) located in the posterior thalamus (vs anterior thalamic lesions in those patients without pushing behavior) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the contralesional extremities was more frequent and more severe in pusher patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, these patients showed more additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> with right thalamic lesions, while they tended to be more aphasic with left thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Posterior thalamus seems to be fundamentally involved in our control of upright body posture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Higher pressure, swelling, and other secondary pathologic processes associated with posterior thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e>) may provoke contraversive pushing in combination with additional neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
