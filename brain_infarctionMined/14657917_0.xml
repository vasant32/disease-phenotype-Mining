<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Annually, about 400,000 new patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are recorded in Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 80% of patients may develop ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In approximately 30-40% of cases, ischemic lesion of the brain eventuates in lethal outcome; the same number of patients remain heavily disabled and only 15-20% of patients return to the previous level of work fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 30-50% of cases, the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> is caused by stenotic and occlusive lesion of aortic arch branches, being more frequently of atherosclerotic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with brachiocephalic artery (BCA) lesion face an important problem of the origin and progression of different forms of cardiac rhythm disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of hemodynamically significant stenotic and occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lesion of brain</z:e> vessels, even transient changes in cardiac rhythm may induce an additional deterioration of cerebral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In turn, the origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the immediate postoperative period in patients after reconstructions on the BCA is a serious complication which may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the long-term results of the surgical treatment in patients with associated BCA lesion and paroxysmal disorders of cardiac rhythm (PDCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment results were analyzed in 89 patients aged 35 to 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 66 (74.2%) men and 23 (25.8%) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had undergone different BCA reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the long-term period, this resulted in the lowering of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Besides, in the long-term period, vascular reconstructions carried out in patients with associated BCA lesion and PDCR not only improved the neurologic status but also favoured the positive course of changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 36.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
