<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> on the 24-h blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a 4-week observation period, a 4-week treatment period 1 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> at 2 mg/day), and a 4-week treatment period 2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> at 4 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven hypertensive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (10 dippers and 17 non-dippers) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average 24-h BP values were significantly decreased after both treatment periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the patients were divided into dippers and non-dippers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> exhibited a different BP-lowering effect in the groups with these two circadian BP patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In dippers, daytime BP was significantly decreased, whereas nighttime BP was not, so an excessive fall of nighttime BP was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-dippers, both daytime and nighttime BP were decreased, with a stronger BP-lowering effect at night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse correlation between the magnitude of the change in nighttime BP and the night/day ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> could induce a sustained decrease of the 24-h BP in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, a more pronounced nighttime BP-lowering effect was observed in non-dippers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the incidence of non-dippers is reported to be high among patients with cerebrovascular disease, better nighttime BP control by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8024">perindopril</z:chebi> might have helped to improve the outcome of such patients in PROGRESS </plain></SENT>
