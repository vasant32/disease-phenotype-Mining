<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> PRARIY, a synthetic fibronectin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, has shown an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> effect in in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> agents lead to reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> PRARIY displays anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective effects following transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) were randomly divided into three groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) controls, PRARI controls, and PRARIY treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral artery was transiently occluded using a 4-0 nylon suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hour later, the occluder was withdrawn, and reperfusion was maintained for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediately after reperfusion, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg, dissolved in PBS) and the same volume of PBS were continuously infused through the right external carotid artery using an osmotic minipump for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were examined at 3, 24, and 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed for determining infarction size, <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, PRARIY did not influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, PRARIY-treated rats showed significantly functional outcome, reduction of infarction size, decrease of TUNEL positive cells, and increase of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) positive cells in the ischemic areas when compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> PRARIY exerts its neuroprotective effects via supporting neural cell survival rather than anti-leukocyte recruitment following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
