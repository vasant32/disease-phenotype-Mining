<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for cerebral microhaemorrhages (CM), their relationship to other MRI lesions in the disease and their potential clinical impact have not been previously defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to examine the frequency, number and location of microhaemorrhages in a multicentre cohort study, defining predisposing factors and associated radiographic markers in CADASIL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected clinical data from 147 consecutive patients enrolled in an ongoing prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degree of neurological disability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were assessed by standardized scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T(1)-weighted, FLAIR and T2*-weighted gradient-echo (GE) MRI sequences were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volume and location of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Number and location of CM were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CM were present in 35% patients, most commonly occurring in the thalamus, brainstem and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The location of CM qualitatively differed from areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between the presence of CM and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.005), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P = 0.014), <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) (P = 0.004) and the volume of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P = 0.010) and WMHs (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of CM was independently associated with SBP (P = 0.005), the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.0004), volume of WMH (P = 0.0005) and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no association was found between blood pressure or HbA1c and the load of WMH or lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of CM was independently associated with increased modified Rankin scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CM are independently associated with blood pressure and HbA1c as well as with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and WMH volume in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Both the vascular risk factors and regional distribution of CM appear distinct from those associated with other MRI markers, suggesting a distinct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These lesions have a potential clinical impact in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings further suggest that modulation of blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels might influence the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
