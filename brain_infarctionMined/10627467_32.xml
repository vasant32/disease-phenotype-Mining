<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a frequent Val34Leu polymorphism in the FXIII A-subunit gene has been shown to be lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> than in controls, whereas it was higher in patients with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) and the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism in 456 patients consecutively recruited with a BI confirmed by MRI, and 456 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of genotypes was different in cases (63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2% Val/Val; 30.9% Val/Leu; 5.9% Leu/Leu) compared with controls (49 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>8% Val/Val; 42.8% Val/Leu; 7.4% Leu/Leu; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carrying the Leu allele was associated with an OR of 0.58 (95% CI = 0.44-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar association was observed in cases and controls free of previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular history (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.36-0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this association was observed after stratification on the main BI subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for traditional vascular risk factors did not modify these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of smoking was modified by the polymorphism (P =.05); the effect of smoking was weaker among Leu carriers than among noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there was a negative association of the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism with BI, thus suggesting a protective effect of the Leu allele against thrombotic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results suggest that among Leu carriers, the protective effect of the polymorphism outweighed the effect of smoking </plain></SENT>
