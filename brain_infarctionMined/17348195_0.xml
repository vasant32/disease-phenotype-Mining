<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 60 male Wistar rats weighing 280 - 320 g were randomly divided into five groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, sham operation, model, XNST treatment( XNST-T) , and Western medicine treatment (WM-T) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> model in rats was induced by injecting the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> of blood powder through the right external carotid artery (ECA) into the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, morphologic change and the express of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin -1beta ( IL-1beta) in hippocampus CAl section and cortex were observed, biochemical criterions including the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> -K+ -ATPase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), and the content of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in hippocampus were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The morphologic change of hippocampus and cortex in both XNST-T and WM-T groups was milder than that in model group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> -K+ -ATPase, LDH and SOD in hippocampus were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly decreased in model group (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>01), and elevated in XNST group (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>01) as well as in WM-T group (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The content of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in hippocampus was significantly increased in model group (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>05), and was reduced in XNST group (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>05) as well as in WM-T group (P &lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results reveal that XNST has the protective effect against cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>And its possible mechanism is that XNST can prevent the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
