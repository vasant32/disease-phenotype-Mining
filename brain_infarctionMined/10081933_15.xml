<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These remote effects may contribute to the neurological deficit following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>; in addition they may lead to post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and affect functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we addressed the question of whether an increase in excitability can be observed contralateral to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) was induced experimentally in rats with an intraluminal silicon-coated filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, brain excitability was tested with extracellulare recording techniques in neocortical coronal brain slices using a paired-pulse stimulus protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rats with MCAO, excitability was increased in the neocortex contralateral to the infarction compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These alterations extended through wide parts of the contralateral neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates that MCAO causes transcallosal electrophysiological diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together with results obtained previously with photothrombotic cortical lesions, it can be concluded that these remote effects are not due to characteristics of the individual lesion model, but are common consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
