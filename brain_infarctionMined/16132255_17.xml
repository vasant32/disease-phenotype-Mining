<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging studies were performed on 25 non-random patients (14 female, 11 male, mean age 51.8 +/- 18.0 years) with isolated cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairments</z:hpo> (CI) were seen in 22 patients (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238707" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impairments of attention</z:e>, planning, control, abstract thought, memory, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037823,C0869217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">speech disturbances</z:e> (naming difficulties, irregularity of speech, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242186" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">agrammatism</z:e>, dysprosodia), visuospatial and quasispatial disturbances, and counting impairments, demonstrating dysfunction of the anterior and posterior associative areas of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of CI varied: 16 patients (64%) showed impairments only in neuropsychological tests, while six (24%) had clinically apparent impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant CI developed in lesions of particular areas (posteroinferolateral and posteromedial/median) of the cerebellar cortex associated with the dominant hemisphere of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The existence of clinically significant CI was independent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were smaller (mean 5.65 cm3) in patients with marked impairments than in others (mean 12.8 cm3) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present studies demonstrated the involvement of the cerebellum in the modulation of CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of CI in cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> depended on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The topical localizations of cerebellar zones controlling CF and movement are different </plain></SENT>
