<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed 28 patients (18 men, 10 women; mean age 63 years) who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in striatum, internal capsule and thalamus on diffusion weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated in addition to conventional T2 weighted images (T2WI) and trace maps of DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists reviewed the location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in combination with and without FA maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exact location of infarction was determined by FA maps, i.e. on the white band of internal capsule or outside the internal capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accuracy and inter-observer agreement on determination of the location of infarction was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> localization by T2WI-DWI only was varied from 72 to 91% according to the observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer agreement value was moderate (Kappa=0.446), when images were interpreted by T2WI-DWI only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestation of each lesions were varied, but sensory motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was mainly observed in thalamic lesion (50%), while pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was predominant in the case of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involving internal capsule, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata (91%) and basal ganglia (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FA map is useful in the evaluation of lacunar lesions in striatum, internal capsule and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation varies according to the exact location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e>, and more accurate diagnosis can be made by FA maps as well as conventional T2-weighted image and DWI </plain></SENT>
