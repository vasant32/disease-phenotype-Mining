<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In cerebral small vessel disease, the core MRI findings include white matter lesions (WML) and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the clinical significance of WML is better understood, the contribution of lacunes to the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether incident lacunes on MRI determine longitudinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> in elderly subjects with WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within the Leukoaraiosis and Disability Study (LADIS), 387 subjects were evaluated with repeated MRI and neuropsychological assessment at baseline and after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of change in global cognitive function and specific cognitive domains over time were analyzed with multivariate linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for demographic factors, baseline cognitive performance, baseline lacunar and WML lesion load, and WML progression, the number of new lacunes was related to subtle decrease in compound scores for executive functions (p = 0.021) and speed and motor control (p = 0.045), but not for memory or global cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of lacunes, WML progression was associated with decrease in executive functions score (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Incident lacunes on MRI parallel a steeper rate of decline in executive functions and psychomotor speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in addition to WML, lacunes determine longitudinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the individual contribution of lacunes on cognition was modest, they cannot be considered benign findings, but indicate a risk of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
