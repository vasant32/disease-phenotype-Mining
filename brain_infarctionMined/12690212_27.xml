<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic background for SBI and white matter lesions in a large Japanese general population was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were recruited from participants in the National Institute for Longevity Sciences, Longitudinal Study of Aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T gene mutation and brain MRI examination were performed in 1721 subjects free of any history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SBI and white matter lesions were diagnosed from MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1721 MRI examinations, SBI was observed in 178 (10.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SBI and white matter lesions increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SBI was significantly higher in subjects with the MTHFR TT genotype compared with the TC+CC genotype (14.6% versus 9.5%; 42 of 288 versus 136 of 1433; chi2=6.71; P=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stage of white matter lesions was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In subjects &gt;or=60 years of age (n=849), the prevalence of SBI was significantly higher in TT than TC+CC (27.7% versus 16.6%; 36 of 130 versus 119 of 719; chi2=9.16; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of moderately advanced white matter lesions was also significantly higher in TT than TC+CC (60.7% versus 49.0%; 79 of 130 versus 352 of 719; chi2=9.16; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After correction for other risk factors, the MTHFR TT genotype was independently associated with SBI (odds ratio [OR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.68; P=0.018) and moderately advanced white matter lesions (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.33; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the MTHFR TT genotype is an independent risk factor for SBI and white matter lesions in the general Japanese population, especially in elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
