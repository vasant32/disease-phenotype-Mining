<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the NOS inhibitors significantly improved survival rate, MABP, and attenuated brain NO overproduction 24, 48 h and 72 h after DHS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that NO formation via iNOS activation may contribute to organ damage and that the selective iNOS inhibitor, AG, may be of interest as a therapeutic agent for neurological recovery following DHS </plain></SENT>
