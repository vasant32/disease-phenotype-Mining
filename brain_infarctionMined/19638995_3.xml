<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated the effect of glycyl-L-methylprolyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16015,29972">L-glutamic acid</z:chebi> (NNZ-2566) to lessen the severity of NCSs caused by permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous electroencephalographic recordings were performed in rats during pMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycyl-L-methylprolyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16015,29972">L-glutamic acid</z:chebi> (3, 10, or 100 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of a fixed dose of 3 mg/kg per hour for 12 h) was delivered at 20 mins after pMCAo (before the first <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> event) or delayed until immediately after the first <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> event occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control rats received pMCAo and saline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that 91% of the saline-treated animals had NCSs (23 episodes per rat and 1238 secs per rat) with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> latency of 35 mins after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When NNZ-2566 was administered before the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> events, it dose-dependently reduced the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> incidence to 36%-80%, decreased <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> frequency to 5-16 episodes per rat, and shortened the total duration of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> to 251-706 secs per rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two high doses significantly reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 28%-30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment also attenuated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> duration but had no effect on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that NNZ-2566 possesses a unique therapeutic potential as a safe prophylactic agent that synergistically provides neuroprotection and reduces injury-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
