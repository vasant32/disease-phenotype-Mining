<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of several experimental studies of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and anecdotal observations suggest that leukocytes may contribute to the injury initiated by an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The timing and the nature of leukocyte responses in evolving brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (either human or experimental) are incompletely characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a study of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in 96 Wistar rats that underwent occlusion of a large intracranial artery for variable intervals ranging between 30 minutes and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental model, based on the occlusion of a middle cerebral artery ostium via the insertion of a nylon monofilament through the external carotid artery, does not require opening the skull; therefore, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> is not influenced by the effects of craniotomy and changes in intracranial pressure are only those induced by the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 96 animals having the same type of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> developed an ischemic brain lesion (limited to the territory of the corresponding artery) that evolved into an area of extensive neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> over a period of 6 to 12 hours followed by pan-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) approximately 60 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, leukocytes (in particular polymorphonuclear cells) were detected in the microvessels (capillaries and venules) of the ischemic hemisphere as early as 30 minutes after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numbers of intravascular neutrophils peaked at 12 hours, whereas intraparenchymal granulocytes were most numerous at 24 hours; a few granulocytes were visible in the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> as late as day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circulating monocytes were first detected within the capillaries/venules of the ischemic area after 4 to 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregates were more abundant in the arterial than the venous side of the circulation, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> obstruction of arteries by platelet aggregates became noticeable only 48 hours after the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were conspicuous for their absence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations provide the background for studies that will attempt to unravel the relationship between the biological responses of leukocytes and neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> secondary to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
