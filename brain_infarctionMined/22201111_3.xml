<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Memory decline commonly occurs among elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This observation is often attributed to early neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus and related brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the contribution of vascular lesions, such as brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, to hippocampal integrity and age-associated memory decline remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 658 elderly participants without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> from a prospective, community-based study on aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> who received high-resolution structural MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified, and hippocampal and relative brain volumes were calculated following standard protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary scores reflecting performance on tasks of memory, language, processing speed, and visuospatial function were derived from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used multiple regression analyses to relate cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, hippocampal and relative brain volume, to measures of cognitive performance in domains of memory, language, processing speed, and visuospatial ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Presence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was associated with a smaller hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smaller hippocampus volume was associated with poorer memory specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with poorer memory and cognitive performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other domains, which was independent of hippocampus volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both hippocampal volume and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> independently contribute to memory performance in elderly individuals without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given that age-associated neurodegenerative conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, are defined primarily by impairment in memory, these findings have clinical implications for prevention and for identification of pathogenic factors associated with disease symptomatology </plain></SENT>
