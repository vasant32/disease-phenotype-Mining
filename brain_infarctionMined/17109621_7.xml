<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether gradual increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) reported during exercise down-regulates expression of TNF-alpha receptors I and II (TNFRI and II) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, leading to reduced brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to 30 minutes of exercise on a treadmill each day for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by a 2-hour middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion using an intra-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expressions of TNFRI and II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the brain were detected using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein expressions of TNFRI and II were determined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) in serum and brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spatial distribution of TNF-alpha receptors in brain regions was determined with immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we addressed the causal effect of TNF-alpha pretreatment on TNF I and II expression using ELISA and real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In exercised rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was significantly (p&lt;0.01) reduced in the entire <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> supplied regions, associated with a mild expression of TNFRI and II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a robust expression of TNFRI and II molecules was found in non-exercised rats subjected to similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion insults </plain></SENT>
