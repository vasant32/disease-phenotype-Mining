<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediate early genes (IEGs) represent the first wave of gene expression following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and are induced in extensive regions of the ischemic brain including cerebral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Neuritin and Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) belong to a subgroup of immediate early genes implicated in synaptic plasticity known as effector immediate early genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal activation pattern for these genes during the first 24 h of reperfusion following 2-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuritin showed a persistent activation in frontal-cingulate cortex while Arc displayed a biphasic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, in dentate gyrus, activation was observed at 0-6 h of reperfusion for Neuritin and 0-12 h of reperfusion for Arc while BDNF was induced 0-9 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates a rapid and long-term activation of effector immediate early genes in distinct brain areas following ischemic injury in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effector gene activation may be part of long-term synaptic responses of ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
