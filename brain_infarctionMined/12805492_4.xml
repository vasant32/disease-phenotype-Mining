<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a lack of systematic data regarding local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) of thromboemboli occurring during neuroendovascular procedures with the use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our technique for treating LIF of intracerebral thromboemboli occurring during neuroendovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine of 723 patients (1.2%) who underwent neuroendovascular procedures during the period from January 1997 to September 2002 suffered thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated by LIF with a maximum dose of 0.9 mg rtPA per kilogram body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was categorized as successful (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] grade 2 or 3) versus unsuccessful (TIMI grade 0 or 1), and clinical outcome was categorized as independent (Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) versus dependent or dead (Rankin Scale score 3 to 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minimum time between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> detection and beginning of LIF was 10 minutes, and the maximum time was 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization was achieved in 4 of 9 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 9 patients suffered cerebral ischemic infarctions, and none of the patients sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients (22%) died from malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients (44%) remained moderately disabled, and 3 patients (33%) were severely disabled 3 months after LIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although we used relatively high doses of rtPA, the recanalization rates and clinical outcome of LIF in our patients were not satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategies for the prevention of thromboemboli during neuroendovascular procedures must be improved, and novel fibrinolytic or thrombolytic techniques should be developed </plain></SENT>
