<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were investigated in patients with LI (20 patients, aged 60.9 +/- 7.3 years), 21 age- and gender-matched patients with SR and 21 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FMD was more impaired in patients with LI (0.4% +/- 5.0%) compared to patients with SR (3.8% +/- 4.8%) and healthy controls (7.9% +/- 6.0%) (P &lt; or = 0.01), whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was similarly thickened in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with LI have a diminished FMD, but a similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, compared to patients with SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal that for a given level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> patients with LI have additional endothelial impairment </plain></SENT>
