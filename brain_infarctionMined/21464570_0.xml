<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have conducted a risk factor profile analysis of the two diseases in a single study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 64 subjects with SBI lesions, 140 patients with sLAC, and 342 controls by retrospective investigation of brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Topographic findings and vascular risk factor profiles were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Compared to the controls, the SBI group was found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.002) and elevated plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sLAC group was found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.004), smoking (p = 0.002), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (p = 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, risk factor profiles of the SBI and sLAC were not exactly the same, indicating a different pathogenesis between the two diseases </plain></SENT>
