<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies regarding the effects of location and size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have yielded inconsistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the relationships of neuroimage findings and longitudinal Barthel index (BI) scores in patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The neuroimage findings of enrolled subjects were grouped by anatomical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was determined by the largest diameter of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up prospectively at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 2 weeks, 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear mixed model was employed for the repeated measurement analysis of BI at these six time points in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BI increased rapidly during the first two months, and reached plateau after four months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The location and size of the lesion had significant effects on serial measurements of BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, treatment mode, and baseline BI score, the posterior cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> group showed the largest improvement in BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a trend that the smaller the lesion size, the more favourable the functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both location and size of lesion in noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significant prognostic factors for functional outcome </plain></SENT>
