<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate the protective effect of postischemic treatment with an EP3 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, ONO-AE3-240, through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models, peritoneal injection of an EP3 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> after occlusion-reperfusion reduced infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and neurological dysfunctions to almost the same levels of those in EP3 knockout (KO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the ischemic cortex investigated by terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 immunostaining were ameliorated in EP3 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>-treated mice or EP3 KO mice as compared with vehicle-treated mice or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between ONO-AE3-240-injected or EP3 KO mice and vehicle-injected or WT mice, respectively, in mean arterial blood pressure, cerebral blood flow or body temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The double-immunostaining showed that EP3 receptor-positive cells were also positive for CD-11b and partially for Neu-N, the marker for microglia and neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletion of EP3 receptors also reduced damage of the blood-brain barrier, activation of microglia and infiltration of neutrophils into the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that EP3 receptors are involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> injury through the enhancement of inflammatory and apoptotic reactions in the ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, EP3 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may be valuable for the treatment of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
