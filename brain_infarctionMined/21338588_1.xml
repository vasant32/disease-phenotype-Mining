<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if subjecting a distant organ, such as the lower limb, to a similar priming ischemic insult would result in protection of the brain from a subsequent severe ischemic injury, as induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) and if this protection is mediated via a neurogenic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult Wistar male rats were subjected to either remote preconditioning (RPC) or sham surgery and then subsequently underwent 2 h MCAo 24, 48 or 72 h after the RPC/sham RPC stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the animals undergoing RPC, only those that sustained MCAo 24 h later showed significantly smaller cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (150.34±30.91 mm(3)) and better clinical neurological outcomes (1.15±0.69) as compared to the sham RPC group (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 250.25±26.98mm(3); neurological score 1.80±0.87) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RPC animals sustaining MCAo at 48 and 72 h later did not show significant differences in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes or clinical neurological outcomes as compared to the sham RPC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, attenuation of the neuroprotective effect by the ganglion blocker hexamethonium suggested a neurogenically mediated pathway responsible for this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remote sub-lethal ischemic injury to both lower limbs results in cerebral protection from subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> within 24 h of initiation of the RPC stimulus and this protection in part may be mediated via a neurogenic pathway </plain></SENT>
