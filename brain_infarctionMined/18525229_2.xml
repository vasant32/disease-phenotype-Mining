<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess retrospectively the treatment results of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> embolization of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) with a dominant outflow vein (DOV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients who had peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> with a DOV were enrolled in this study (mean age, 29.7 years; range, 15-42 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> embolizations (mean, 2.7; range, 1-8) were performed by direct puncture (n = 29), the transarterial approach (n = 13), the transvenous approach (n = 5), or a combination of methods (n = 4) under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coil and/or core-removed guide wire embolization of the DOV or another flow occlusion technique (i.e., use of an external pneumatic pressure cuff) to achieve vascular stasis were required in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up (mean, 22.2 months; range, 1-53 months) was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and imaging follow-up (mean, 22.1 months; range, 2-53 months) from the last treatment session was performed for 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic outcome (cure, improvement, no change, or aggravation) was assessed according to the clinical response and the degree of devascularization at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">Ethanol</z:chebi> embolization was considered as an effective procedure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (68%) of 19 patients were cured and six displayed improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of six patients with improvement needed further treatment sessions for residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients (21%) experienced a total of eight complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five complications (three events of a distal embolism and one event each of a urinary bladder <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> related to the accidental cannulation of the common carotid artery during insertion of the Swan-Ganz catheter) were major and three complications (skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>) were minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> with a DOV can be effectively treated with a high cure rate by the use of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> embolization alone or in conjunction with the use of coil and/or core-removed guide wire embolization </plain></SENT>
