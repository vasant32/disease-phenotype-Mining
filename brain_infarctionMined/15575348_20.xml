<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is well recognized that the season of the year exerts an influence on some diseases and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the influence of seasonal changes on diseases and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Japan using the Japan Vital Statistics from 1970 to 1999 and recorded weather data (mean temperature), by a Fourier decomposition in a log linear regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major influences of seasonal change with the highest rates in winter were seen on the following: the overall causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041849" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious and parasitic diseases</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tuberculosis; respiratory</z:e> disease, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>; heart and cerebrovascular diseases; <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">digestive diseases</z:e> and accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two peaks were seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicides</z:e>, a large peak in April and a small peak in autumn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and homicides were little or not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> influenced by seasonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no major difference in changes between the years studied, except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e>, which showed a clear reduction in the seasonality effect from 1970 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the overall mortality rate and to prolong life expectancy in Japan, measures must be taken to reduce those mortality rates associated with seasonal differences, especially those causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> which show a strong correlation with seasonal change: respiratory, heart, cerebrovascular, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
