<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted to our emergency department (ED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 286 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one patients were admitted within 3 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological deficit, of which 28 received IV thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 25 patients no thrombolytic treatment was given because of the presence of the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) exclusion criteria, and one patient refused treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No thrombolytic treatment was given to 27 patients because of mild neurological deficit or rapid clinical improvement, and after 3 months <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients were independently living at home without nursing help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite a public campaign to gain awareness concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the majority of the patients arrived too late at the ED for thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of the patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are admitted too late to receive IV thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More needs to be done to increase both public and medical awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a treatable emergency </plain></SENT>
