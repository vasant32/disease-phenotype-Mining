<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism may play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) susceptibility, but the results among the populations studied to date have not been consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the association between ACE genotypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and SBI in Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: DNA samples from 237 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, 264 SBI patients and 234 age-matched controls were amplified using polymerase chain reaction to detect the ACE ins/del (I/D) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype was determined by the presence of a 490-bp band (I allele) or a 190-bp band (D allele) in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Odds ratios of the I/D and D/D genotypes and the overall (I/D + D/D) for the I/I genotype were significantly different between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference between patients with SBI and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of a significant association between ACE polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no consistent associations have been found between ACE polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the populations studied to date, the ACE polymorphism may be a genetic determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, at least in Korean patients </plain></SENT>
