<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies on alterations of circadian blood pressure patterns after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in circadian blood pressure patterns in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and their relation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We studied 98 consecutive patients who were admitted within 24 h after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a detailed clinical examination, laboratory studies and a CT scan study of the brain on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study the circadian rhythm of blood pressure, a continuous blood pressure monitor (Spacelab 90217) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the percentage fall in the mean systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure at night compared with during the day as: dippers (fall&gt; or =10-20%); extreme dippers (&gt; or =20%); nondipper (&lt;10%); and reverse dippers (&lt;0%, that is, an increase in the mean nocturnal blood pressure compared with the mean daytime blood pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were separated and analysed in two groups: lacunar and nonlacunar infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical testing was conducted using the SSPS 12.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Methods We studied 60 males and 38 females, mean age: 70.5+/-11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient population consisted of 62 (63.2%) lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 36 (36.8%) nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the most common risk factor (67 patients, 68.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> (44 patients, 44.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (38 patients, 38.7%), smoking (24 patients, 24.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (19 patients, 19.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were predominantly men (P=0.037) and had a lower frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (P=0.016) as compared with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, the mean systolic blood pressure was 136+/-20 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 78.7+/-11.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Comparing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, there were no differences in 24-h systolic blood pressure and 24-h diastolic blood pressure between patients with lacunar and nonlacunar infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> showed a mean decline in day-night systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 4 mmHg [systolic blood pressure: 3.9 (SD 10) mmHg, P=0.003; diastolic blood pressure 3.7 (SD 7) mmHg, P=0.0001] compared with nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> showed a lack of 24-h nocturnal systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diurnal variation in systolic blood pressure was abolished in 87 (88.9%) patients, and the variation in diastolic blood pressure was abolished in 76 (77.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>On comparing lacunar and nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, we found that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diurnal variation in systolic blood pressure was abolished in 53 (85.4%) lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and in 34 (94.4%) nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (P=nonsignificant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In terms of diurnal variation in diastolic blood pressure, it was abolished in 43 (69.3%) lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and in 33 (91.6%) nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show clear differences in the blood pressure circadian rhythm of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> between lacunar and nonlacunar infarctions by means of 24-h blood pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure dip was significantly higher in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Besides, patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> presented a higher percentage of dipping patterns in the diastolic blood pressure circadian rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, one should consider the ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype when deciding on the management of blood pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
