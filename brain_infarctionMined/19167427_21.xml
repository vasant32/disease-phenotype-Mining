<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Considerable debate exists in the literature on how best to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damage and at what point after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is histologically complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As many researchers are focusing on more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> endpoints in neuroprotection studies it is important to evaluate histological damage at later time points to ensure that standard methods of tissue injury measurement are accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To compare tissue viability at both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> time points, we used 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC), Fluoro-Jade B, and NeuN staining to examine the evolving phases of infarction induced by a 90-min MCAO in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> outcomes were examined at 1.5h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, and 7d after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a time-dependent increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 1.5h to 24h in the cortex, followed by a plateau from 24h to 7d after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were complete by 12h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-Jade B staining peaked at 24h and was minimal by 7d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that histological damage as measured by TTC and Fluoro-Jade B reaches its peak by 24h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a reperfusion model of MCAO in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TTC staining can be accurately performed as late as 7d after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits do not correlate with the structural lesion but rather transient impairment of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is complete by 24h and even earlier in the striatum, even the most efficacious neuroprotective therapies are unlikely to show any efficacy if given after this point </plain></SENT>
