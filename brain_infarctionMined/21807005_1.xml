<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite several decades of research, current antidepressant (AD) treatments remain of a limited efficacy justifying the need to find new drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These drugs have to be more efficacious, more rapid and display lesser side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e>, we recently identified spadin as a new antidepressant molecule that acts more quickly than classical ADs, working within 4 days to get same effects obtained with other ADs after 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spadin blocks TREK-1 K(2P) <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels that are considered as new targets for ADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the TREK-1 channel is known to increase sensitivity to pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus blocking these channels could result in deleterious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study we showed that spadin did not interfere with other TREK-1 controlled functions such as pain, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that spadin was unable to inhibit currents generated by TREK-2, TRAAK, TASK and TRESK four other K2P channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, spadin did not induce cardiac dysfunctions, did not block I(Kr) and I(Ks) and did not modify the systolic pressure or cardiac pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a three week treatment spadin remained an efficacious AD and did not modify the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in brain following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed that kainate induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and glycemia were not modified by spadin treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data, together with those previously published reinforce the idea that spadin represents a good candidate for a new generation of ADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This article is part of a Special Issue entitled '<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>' </plain></SENT>
