<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are a frequent consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main goal of the present study is to verify whether anoxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> per se is able to induce early changes in excitability that may be a prelude to the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and, ultimately, to epileptogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excitability changes in the very <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postischemic phase are here analyzed in a new model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> developed in the isolated guinea pig brain preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent bilateral occlusion of the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) was performed in the isolated guinea pig brain maintained in vitro by arterial perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemistry were utilized to identify the penumbra and core regions induced by ACA occlusion (ACAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slow potentials and evoked responses recorded in olfactory cortices were utilized to evaluate excitability changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: ACAo induces a core area located in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and a region of penumbra in the underlying olfactory cortices, where characteristic slow potential shifts, but no reduction of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) signal and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) immunostaining (typical of ischemic core) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recording of responses evoked by low- and high-frequency stimulations of the lateral olfactory tract showed no excitability changes in the early hours that follow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the olfactory cortical areas supplied by ACAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The absence of early hyperexcitability changes in an isolated whole brain model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, strongly suggests that brain <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> per se does not contribute to the generation of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the view that blood-borne events (such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) may play a major role in early postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
