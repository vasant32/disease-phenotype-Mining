<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In the treatment of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), early occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is necessary as well as monitoring and treatment of complications following the primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monitoring with microdialysis has been studied for its ability to indicate and predict the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 42 patients with aneurysmal SAH microdialysis monitoring of metabolites was performed using a 0.3-microl/minute perfusion flow over several days, and the results were correlated to clinical events and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> observed on computerized tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microdialysis probe was inserted into the territory of the parent artery of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors defined an ischemic pattern as increases in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (L/G) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> (L/P) ratios that were greater than 20% followed by a 20% increase in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This ischemic pattern was found in 17 of 18 patients who experienced a DIND and in three of 24 patients who did not experience a delayed clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ischemic pattern preceded the occurrence of a DIND by a mean interval of 11 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum L/G and L/P ratios did not correlate with the presence of DIND or outcome, and there was no association between the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> level and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microdialysis monitoring of the cerebral metabolism in patients with SAH may predict with high sensitivity and specificity the occurrence of a DIND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether an earlier diagnosis results in better treatment of DINDs and, therefore, in overall better outcomes remains to be proven, as it is linked to an efficacious treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
