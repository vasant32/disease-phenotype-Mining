<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of surgical decompression to decrease the mortality and morbidity in patients with STMBI refractory to medical therapy and to compare the results with those of the medically managed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 24 consecutive patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of STMBI, refractory to medical management in 2 years, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Option of surgical decompression after explaining the outcome, risk and benefits of the procedure was given to the attendants/relatives of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were fulfilling the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient group, whose attendants/relatives were not willing to undergo surgery, were subjected to the same medical therapy and they were taken as the "control group." RESULTS: Supratentorial malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were more common in the age group of 41-60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age of presentation was 42.16 ± 16.2 years and the mean GCS on admission was 7.83 ± 2.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 16.7% in the surgically and 25.0% in the medically managed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients operated early (&lt;48 h), age ≤60 years, midline shift &lt;5 mm and size of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> less than 2/3(rd) of the vascular territory involved showed good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome revealed by modified Rankin Score (mRS) and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was better in surgically managed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of the Zung Self-Rating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Score were better in surgically managed patients at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Barthal Index in the surgically managed group showed statistically significant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive hemicraniectomy with duroplasty if performed early in STMBI not only decreases the mortality but also increases the functional outcome when compared with patients who were managed conservatively with medical therapy only </plain></SENT>
