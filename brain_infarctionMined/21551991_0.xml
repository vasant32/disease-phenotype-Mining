<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: 1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> (n=10); 2) Exercise (n=10); 3) Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo), n=10); 4) Exercise+MCAo (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both exercise groups ran on a treadmill at a speed of 15 m/min, 30 min/day for 4 weeks, then, MCAo was performed for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was measured by Nissl staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of the remaining neuronal cell after MCAo, and microvascular protein expression on the motor cortex, showed the expression of Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) &amp; laminin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 48 hr of MCAo, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly reduced in the Ex+MCAo group (15.6±2.7%) compared to the MCAo group (44.9±3.8%) (p&lt;.05), and many neuronal cells were detected in the Ex+MCAo group (70.8±3.9%) compared to the MCAo group (43.4±5.1%) (p&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity of laminin, as a marker of microvessels and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were intensively increased in the Ex+MCAo group compared to the MCAo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the neuroprotective effects of exercise pre-conditioning reduce ischemic brain injury through strengthening the microvascular integrity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
