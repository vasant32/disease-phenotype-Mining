<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects and mechanism of power-frequency electromagnetic fields on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism and homodynamic during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were divided into 2 groups, 55 cases of them were treated by exposure to power-frequency electromagnetic fields, 60 cases were treated as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Barthel index and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were used to evaluate rehabilitation outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and its subclasses, homodynamic parameters were compared at pre- and post-rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment group showed a statistically significant better prognosis compared with the control group(P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The score of Barthel index also increased after treatment(P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol(Tc), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>(TG), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>(<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c) levels dropped and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>(<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c) increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Tc/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c ratio along with the blood and plasma viscosity decreased significantly compared with the controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence decreased significantly after the treatment compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The power-frequency electromagnetic fields can improve <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism and homodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can improve the ADL and FIM of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, which may have significant implications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
