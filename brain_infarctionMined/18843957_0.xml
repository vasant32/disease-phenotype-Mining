<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence by age, response to different therapies and outcome in newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients who were hospitalized from July 1992 to December 2006 and followed up with telephone were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 103 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time of follow-up was between 2 months to 15years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male:female = 35:68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of patients over 60 years old was 34.0% (35/103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>59 patients were sensitive to adrenocorticosteroid and 4 patients under going splenectomy achieved a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>: including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>(CsA) used in the present series, CsA was shown to be more effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It could increase the platelet count when given together with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, the effective rate was 81.3% (26/32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe side effects like kiney function failure were not found in CsA treated patients so the use of geug in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> would be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 2, 1 and 1 ITP patients progressing respectively to Sjogren' s syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>7 patients died, 1 patient died of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 2 brain infarction, 3 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrosis</z:hpo> The refractory rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> is 17.2% (10/58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity in older people is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mortal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient </plain></SENT>
