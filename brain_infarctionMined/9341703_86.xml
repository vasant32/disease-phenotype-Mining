<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the usefulness of serial measurements of S-100 protein versus neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in blood samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using nonisotopic sandwich immunoassays, we measured plasma concentrations of S-100 protein and NSE on admission and on days 3, 4, 7, and 14 after infarction in 44 patients (age range, 22 to 86 years; mean age, 65.1 years; 12 female, 32 male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured by volumetric CT on day 4 after ictus, and clinical outcome was assessed at discharge from hospital with the Activities of Daily Living Scale and 6 months after infarction with the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak blood levels of S-100 protein were found on day 2.5 +/- 1.3, and peak levels of NSE were found on day 1.9 +/- 0.8 after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak plasma levels of S-100 protein correlated well with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = .75, P &lt; .001) and with clinical outcome assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (r = .51, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of NSE correlated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (r = .37, P &lt; .05) but not with clinical outcome (r = .18, P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that measuring blood concentrations of S-100 protein periodically in the first 10 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> helps to predict <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and the long-term neurological outcome more accurately than periodic measurements of blood concentrations of NSE </plain></SENT>
