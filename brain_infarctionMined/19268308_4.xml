<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with focal cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were studied prospectively after their injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent a complete neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neuropsychological examination, as well as a specific computerized battery (Test of Attentional Performance), and an "ecological" test: the Multiple Errands Task-hospital version (MET-hv, adapted version) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found between patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in language and executive functions tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed in the flexibility subscale of the Test of Attentional Performance and several subscales of the MET-hv (total amount of failures, interpretation failures, task completion score, and inefficiencies subscale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study supports previous reports showing a pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive abnormalities</z:hpo> following focal cerebellar damage that includes impairments of executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it suggests that the ecological test used in this investigation might be useful for the detection of deficits in real-life executive functioning among this patient population </plain></SENT>
