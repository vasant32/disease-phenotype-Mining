<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The interhemispheric transcallosal approach offers an excellent surgical corridor for the treatment of deep-seated midline lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The approach typically requires the sacrifice of one or more middle-third superior sagittal sinus (SSS) cortical bridging veins, which introduces the risk of venous infarction and associated neurological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the incidence of venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> following this operative approach in a pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of surgical cases involving pediatric patients treated at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles between 1990 and 2007, in which an interhemispheric transcallosal operative procedure was performed and one or more middle-third SSS cortical bridging veins were occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies done 1-3 days following the procedure were analyzed and compared with preoperative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging evidence of venous infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occlusion of one or more middle-third SSS cortical bridging veins related to the interhemispheric transcallosal approach resulted in no incidence of cerebral venous infarction in this pediatric population </plain></SENT>
