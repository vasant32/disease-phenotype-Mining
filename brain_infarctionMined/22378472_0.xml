<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 220 consecutive patients (mean age, 69 years) without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed for the presence of SBI, WMHs and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was evaluated using CAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized into one of two groups according to the presence or absence of SBI and WMHs, and clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAVI was significantly higher in patients with SBI or in patients with WMHs than in those without those respective findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CAVI cutoff values for detection of SBI and WMHs were 9.2 and 8.9, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analyses, CAVI, a one point increase in CAVI: odds ratio (OR), 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.56; CAVI ≥9.2: OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.16-5.02, was independently associated with SBI, however, CAVI was not independently associated with WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with CAVI ≥9.2 had higher OR for the presence of both SBI and WMHs (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.15-5.98) when compared with patients with CAVI &lt;9.2 after adjustment for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SBI is independently associated with arterial stiffness indicated by CAVI </plain></SENT>
