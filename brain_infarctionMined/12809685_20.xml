<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Which components of the enriched environment that are of greatest importance for recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously found that enriched environment and social interaction alone both improve functional recovery after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, compared with isolated housing with voluntary wheel-running </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the aim was to separate components of the enriched environment and investigate the effects on some potential mediators of improved functional recovery; such as the inducible transcription factors nerve growth factor-induced gene A (NGFI-A) and NGFI-B, and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rats were divided into four groups: individually housed with no equipment (deprived group), individually housed with free access to a running wheel (running group), housed together in a large cage with no equipment (social group) or in a large cage furnished with exchangeable bars, chains and other objects (enriched group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of inducible transcription factors, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors was determined with in situ hybridisation 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats housed in enriched or social environments showed significantly higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of NGFI-A and NGFI-B in cortical regions outside the lesion and in the CA1 (cornu ammonis region of the hippocampus), compared with isolated rats with or without a running wheel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NGFI-A and NGFI-B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in cortex and in CA1 was significantly correlated to functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(1A)) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and binding, as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(2A) receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were decreased in the hippocampus (CA4 region) of the running wheel rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">Mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor gene expression was increased in the dentate gyrus amongst wheel-running rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No group differences were found in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> levels or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor, corticotropin-releasing hormone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>(2C) or c-fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have found that social interaction is a major component of the enriched environment regarding the effects on NGFI-A and NGFI-B expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These transcription factors may be important mediators of improved functional recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e>, induced by environmental enrichment </plain></SENT>
