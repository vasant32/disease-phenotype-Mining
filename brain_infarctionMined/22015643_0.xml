<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Peri-ischemic early venous filling (PEVD) has been reported to occur at certain stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and has previously been termed as "luxury perfusion" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on the significance of PEVD after a successful endovascular recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment from February 2006 to April 2010 in two centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PEVD was rated as present or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infarction was evaluated on computed tomography (CT) â‰¥ 18 h post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Localization of the PEVD and the infarction was noted for the anterior and posterior circulation; for the anterior circulation, also deep and superficial veins/brain regions were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 151 of the 175 patients developed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 151 patients, 118 had PEVD (sensitivity 78.1%); meanwhile, 20 of 24 patients without an infarction had no PEVD (specificity 83.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent localization of the PEVD and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was seen in 107/151 patients (70.9%); in 28 of these 107 cases, the territory of PEVD was smaller than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (26.2%) and exceeded it in 7/107 patients (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Territorial congruency of the PEVD and the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was 57.6-75% for deep/superficial brain regions of the anterior, but only 16.7% for the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Separate evaluation for the anterior circulation resulted in a 94.9% sensitivity and an 81.0% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PEVD is a potential angiographic predictor for irreversible regional tissue damage and subsequent infarction despite successful recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding deserves further studies and may influence therapeutic decisions such as post-treatment anticoagulative medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It may also be considered in potential refined classifications of angiographic reperfusion success in the future </plain></SENT>
