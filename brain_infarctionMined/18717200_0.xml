<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging revealed a high-intensity area in the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebrobasilar (VB) territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRA showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography with a sector probe (2MHz) showed a mobile mass with an acoustic echo in the innominate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a calcified mass in the innominate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite full-dose antithrombotic therapy, recurrent attacks could not be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the innominate artery was performed by cardiac surgeons, and a ruptured calcified plaque was found in the innominate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent, computed tomography of the brain showed calcified emboli in the right ICA and VB territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial ultrasonography appears to be very useful in evaluating the innominate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On finding calcified emboli, an embolic source should be searched for in the aorta, heart valves, and the innominate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with calcified emboli are found only in the right ICA and VB territories, the innominate artery should be explored by ultrasonography for the presence of a calcified atheroma </plain></SENT>
