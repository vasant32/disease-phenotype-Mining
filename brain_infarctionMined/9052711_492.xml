<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> to the clinical expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cognitive function and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were determined for participants in the Nun Study who later died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, lacunar and larger brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> in the neocortex were quantitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants with abundant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> in the neocortex were classified as having met the neuropathologic criteria for AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Convents in the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southern United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 102 college-educated women aged 76 to 100 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive function assessed by standard tests and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD assessed by clinical and neuropathologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 61 participants who met the neuropathologic criteria for AD, those with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had poorer cognitive function and a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> than those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or deep white matter had an especially high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, compared with those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (the odds ratio [OR] for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was 20.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.5-288.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fewer neuropathologic lesions of AD appeared to result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in those with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or deep white matter than in those without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among 41 participants who did not meet the neuropathologic criteria for AD, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were only weakly associated with poor cognitive function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 102 participants, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the circle of Willis was strongly associated with lacunar and large brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease may play an important role in determining the presence and severity of the clinical symptoms of AD </plain></SENT>
