<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA) demonstrated the first segment of the basal vein of Rosenthal passing in front of the internal carotid artery and the anastomosis with the cavernous sinus, the partially hypoplastic second segment, and the superficial sylvian vein entering the lateral side of the sphenoparietal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the sylvian fissure toward the distal direction enabled transfer of the superficial sylvian vein to the temporal side, but the bridging vein had to be sacrificed to secure adequate operating space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CT demonstrated hemorrhagic infarction at the left caudate head and surrounding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative venous infarction is not an uncommon complication of various approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3D-CTA can provide important information about the venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> indispensable for avoiding postoperative venous infarction </plain></SENT>
