<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters might predict clinical outcome, recanalization and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients treated by intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed prior to thrombolysis and at day 1 with the following sequences: magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), T2*-gradient echo (GE) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was assessed at day 60 by T2-weighted imaging (T2-WI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was assessed prior to rt-PA therapy and the modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) score was assessed at day 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A poor outcome was defined as a day 60 m-RS score &gt;2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the predictors of clinical outcome, recanalization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline NIHSS score was the best independent indicator of clinical outcome (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A worse clinical outcome was observed in patients with tandem internal carotid artery (ICA)+middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion versus other sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (p=0.009), and in patients with larger pretreatment PWI (p=0.001) and DWI (p=0.01) lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two factors predict a low rate of recanalization: a proximal site of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (p=0.02) and a delayed time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) on pretreatment PWI (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was correlated with pretreatment DWI lesion volume (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was associated with a lower final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a severe baseline NIHSS score, a critical level of pretreatment DWI/PWI parameters and a proximal site of occlusion are predictive of a worse outcome after IV rt-PA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
