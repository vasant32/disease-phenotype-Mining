<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although detailed mechanisms of SBI pathogenesis have yet to be determined, recent studies suggest that SBI is significantly influenced by genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) gene (i.e., -786T&gt;C, 4a4b and 894G&gt;T) as possible risk factors for SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 269 patients with SBI and 234 control subjects and examined their fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels, and analyzed for eNOS polymorphisms and haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SBI was shown to be significantly higher in patients with the eNOS 894GT genotype (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.30-3.08) and 894GT+TT genotype (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.34-3.16), compared with the 894GG genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the case of -786T&gt;C and 4a4b polymorphisms, no significant difference was observed between SBI patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that the prevalence of SBI can increase twice as high when either -786T&gt;C or 4a4b polymorphism was combined with 894G&gt;T polymorphism, -786TC+CC/894GT+TT (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.24-11.80) and 4a4b+4a4a/894GT+TT (OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.34-12.40), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to haplotype analysis, we found that three haplotypes (-786T-4b-894G, -786T-4b-894T and -786C-4a-894T) were shown to be significantly different between SBI patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that eNOS polymorphisms and haplotypes serve as risk factors for SBI, and three different polymorphic loci in the eNOS gene play interactively, thereby leading to synergistic effects for the generation of SBI </plain></SENT>
