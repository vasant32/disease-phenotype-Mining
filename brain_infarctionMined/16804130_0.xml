<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition support has been commonly used to improve nutrition status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine whether significant alterations in fluid and serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> and K+ levels due to nasogastric tube feeding depended on patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted by retrospective review of the medical records of tube-fed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> who had been hospitalized in a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of overhydration were high before tube feeding in both elderly and nonelderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This overhydration rate became more prevalent after iso-osmolal tube feeding in the elderly but decreased somewhat in the nonelderly subjects, and this difference in fluid balance after tube feeding between the elderly and nonelderly was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to fluid balance, serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> and K+ concentrations were no different in the elderly and nonelderly patients after tube feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the results showed that overhydration state was prominent after tube feeding in the elderly, it appeared that there was a very mild clinical impact because the osmolality and serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> were not changed in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, more attention to the maintenance of fluid balance in the elderly tube-fed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is needed because elderly patients have great difficulty in maintaining a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fluid balance </plain></SENT>
