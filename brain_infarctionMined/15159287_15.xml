<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date, no prospective studies have examined the association between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective, nested, case-control study of Japanese subjects 40 to 85 years of age was conducted by using frozen serum samples from 11 846 participants in cardiovascular risk surveys collected from 1984 to 1995 for one community and 1989 to 1995 for the other two communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By the end of 2000, we identified 150 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, the subtypes of which were confirmed by imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three control subjects per case were selected by matching for sex, age, community, year of serum storage, and fasting status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control subjects, total (n=150), hemorrhagic (n=52), and ischemic (n=98) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had higher geometric mean values of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and higher proportions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> &gt; or =11.0 micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multivariate odds ratios (95% CI) for highest (&gt; or =11.0 micromol/L) versus lowest quartiles (&lt;7.0 micromol/L) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> after adjustment for body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, serum total cholesterol, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were 2.99 (1.51 to 5.93) for total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 3.89 (1.60 to 9.46) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 3.36 (1.27 to 8.90) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, and 1.63 (0.44 to 6.00) for hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The respective multivariate odds ratios associated with a 5-micromol/L increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> were 1.40 (1.09 to 1.80), 1.52 (1.07 to 2.14), 1.48 (1.01 to 2.18), and 1.10 (0.76 to 1.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The excess risk of total and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> did not vary significantly according to sex, age, smoking status, or hypertensive status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were associated with the increased risk of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, more specifically <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, among Japanese men and women </plain></SENT>
