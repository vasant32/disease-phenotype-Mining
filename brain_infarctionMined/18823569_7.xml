<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGF-R2)-positive cells induced from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into both endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells (MCs) and these vascular cells construct blood vessel structures in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have also established a method for the large-scale expansion of ECs and MCs derived from human ES cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the potential of vascular cells derived from human ES cells to contribute to vascular regeneration and to provide therapeutic benefit for the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Phosphate buffered saline, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hMNCs), ECs-, MCs-, or the mixture of ECs and MCs derived from human ES cells were intra-arterially transplanted into mice after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transplanted ECs were successfully incorporated into host capillaries and MCs were distributed in the areas surrounding endothelial tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow and the vascular density in the ischemic striatum on day 28 after MCAo had significantly improved in ECs-, MCs- and ECs+MCs-transplanted mice compared to that of mice injected with saline or transplanted with hMNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, compared to saline-injected or hMNC-transplanted mice, significant reduction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as acceleration of neurological recovery were observed on day 28 after MCAo in the cell mixture-transplanted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transplantation of ECs and MCs derived from undifferentiated human ES cells have a potential to contribute to therapeutic vascular regeneration and consequently reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
