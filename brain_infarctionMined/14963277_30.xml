<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthesized by endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) is a key mediator of endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the role of 3 potentially functional eNOS polymorphisms (T-786C, intron 4ab, G894T) located toward the 5' flanking end of the gene as risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> subtypes: isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (n=137) and ischemic leukoaraiosis (n=160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and 600 community controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined through polymerase chain reaction with or without restriction fragment digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nitrate (NO(x)) levels were determined in a subgroup by use of a Griess method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms were tested individually and in combination with haplotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intron 4a variant was protective against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was confined to isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.86; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Haplotypes encountered were significantly different in this subtype compared with controls (P=0.001), with the -786C promoter/intron 4a combination particularly underrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NO(x) levels were associated with the T-786C locus (P=0.03) but only in the presence of the intron 4a allele (P=0.07 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intron 4ab insertion/deletion genotype was associated with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Haplotype and functional studies suggested that the protective effect of the 4a variant could be mediated through changes in eNOS promoter activity and increased NO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The specific association with isolated symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and not ischemic leukoaraiosis may reflect different etiopathogeneses of the 2 subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Lack of NO could predispose to localized microatheroma in proximal arterioles rather than diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> affecting distal perforating vessels </plain></SENT>
