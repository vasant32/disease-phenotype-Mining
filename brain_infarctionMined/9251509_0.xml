<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 63-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> was scheduled for the cystoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient had no prominent preoperative abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was maintained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/oxygen combined with a spinal block and a continuous epidural block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia lasted uneventfully for 16.5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, emergence from anesthesia was delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the first postoperative day, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> and right hemiparalysis was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The computed tomography (CT) of the brain demonstrated a low density area in the frontoparietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated the corresponding lesion as the CT had demonstrated, and an old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This meant that the patient had a history of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (ABI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with ABI are considered to be a high-risk group for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is important to evaluate the risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> preoperatively and to minimize those risks during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of the cerebral perfusion pressure is imperative </plain></SENT>
