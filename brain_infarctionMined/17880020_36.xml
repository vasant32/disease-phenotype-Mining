<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The risk for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (sICH) associated with thrombolytic treatment has not been evaluated in large studies using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the relation between pretreatment DWI lesion size and the risk for sICH after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, prospectively collected data from 645 patients with anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis within 6 hours (&lt;3 hours: n = 320) after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized according to the pretreatment DWI lesion size into three prespecified groups: small (&lt; or =10 ml; n = 218), moderate (10-100 ml; n = 371), and large (&gt;100 ml; n = 56) DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 44 (6.8%) patients experienced development of sICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sICH rate was significantly different between subgroups: 2.8, 7.8, and 16.1% in patients with small, moderate, and large DWI lesions, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This translates to a 5.8 (2.8)-fold greater sICH risk for patients with large DWI lesions as compared with patients with small (or moderate) DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were similar in the large subgroup (n = 536) of patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DWI lesion size remained an independent risk factor when including National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, age, time to thrombolysis, and leukoariosis in a logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: This multicenter study provides estimates of sICH risk in potential candidates for thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sICH risk increases gradually with increasing DWI lesion size, indicating that the potential benefit of therapy needs to be balanced carefully against the risk for sICH, especially in patients with large DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
