<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other etiologies for infarction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), however, have not been well-studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence and etiologies for infarction after SAH, we reviewed the head CT scans of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SAH patients at our center from 1993-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1993-2000, 679 consecutive patients were admitted with SAH, of which 619 patients underwent surgical or endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers examined the head CT scans of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 619 patients for new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was collected from a prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 505 patients were treated with surgical clipping; 114 with endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were CT findings of new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 189 patients (30%): 140 in the surgical group (28%) and 49 in the endovascular group (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The etiologies for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the surgical group were vasospasm 79 (15%), perforator occlusion 40 (8%), large vessel occlusion 14 (3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> 4 (1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> 2 (0.4%), and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> 1 (0.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> in the endovascular group were due to vasospasm 20 (18%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> 12 (11%), large vessel occlusion/dissection 9 (8%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> 4 (4%), perforator occlusion 3 (3%), and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> 1 (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hunt Hess Grade (P &lt; 0.001), Fisher Score (P &lt; 0.0001), and MGH Grade (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with CT-demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in incidence of CT-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> when the period 1993-1996 was compared to 1997-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in the treatment of SAH, there is still a significant incidence of associated radiographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hunt Hess Grade, Fisher Score, and MGH Grade were significantly associated with CT-demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
