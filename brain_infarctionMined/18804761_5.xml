<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scarce findings are, however, available on the detection of complement activation products in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have measured plasma levels of the five complement activation products (C1rC1sC1inh, C4d, C3a, C5a and SC5b-9) in samples of 26 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> upon admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with severe carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> served as patient controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of two activation products (SC5b-9 and C4d)) were significantly elevated in the plasma of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, SC5b-9 levels, exhibited significant positive correlation with the clinical severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the severity of neurological deficit, as well as with the level of functional disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that complement activation plays an active role in the development of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measurement of complement activation products might help to determine the clinical prognosis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is potential usefulness of complement modulating therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
