<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examine whether participation in leisure activities modifies the effect of WML load on cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data are from 2300 men and women (aged 66-92 years) participating in the population-based Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subcortical WML load was calculated as a weighted sum, based on size of lesions in the four lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Periventricular WML load was calculated as the sum of lesion scores, based on size, for the frontal caps, occipitoparietal caps and bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The upper quartile of lesion load in either area was compared to the lower three quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Composite scores of memory (MEM), speed of processing (SP), and executive function (EF) were constructed from a battery of neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequency of participation in nine cognitively stimulating leisure activities was assessed via questionnaire; the upper quartile was compared to the lower three quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression, controlling for demographic and health factors and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, was used to test the main effects and interaction of WMLs and leisure activity on cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High leisure activity was associated with higher performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cognitive abilities: MEM beta = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.29; SP beta = 0.37, 95% CI, 0.29-0.45; and EF beta = 0.23, 95% CI, 0.15-0.29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High WML load was associated with significantly lower performance in SP (beta = -0.06, 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect of WMLs on SP performance was modified by high leisure activity (p for interaction &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activity may attenuate the effect of WML pathology on cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
