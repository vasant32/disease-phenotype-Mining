<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study addressed the association of HLA-DR gene with atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) in a North Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The genotyping of HLA-DRB1 was determined by standard techniques based on polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotides hybridization in a gene chip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The relative risk (RR) of HLA-DRB1 FNx01 04 and HLA-DRB1 FNx01 03 (17) in patients with ACI and their first-degree relatives were significantly higher than those in the control group (RR=2.56 and 18.77, respectively; P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the RR of HLA-DRB1 FNx01 12 was dramatically reduced in patients with ACI in relation to healthy controls (RR=0.17; P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1 may influence the risk of ACI in the North Han population of China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to validate the observation in larger samples </plain></SENT>
