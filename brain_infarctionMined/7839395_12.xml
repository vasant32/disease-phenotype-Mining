<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated this problem in young adults, in whom even a thorough workup often fails to reveal any predisposing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a hospital-based case-control study comprising 75 consecutive subjects aged 16 to 40 years with first-ever ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 133 control subjects from the same hospital who were group-matched with the case patients for age, sex, day of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, and acuteness of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that alcohol intake exceeding 40 g of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> within the 24 hours preceding disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was a significant independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> among both men (odds ratio [OR], 6.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 20.3) and women (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 60.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking was not found to be an independent risk factor in the model, whereas among men arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.5 to 24.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that very recent alcohol drinking, particularly drinking for intoxication, may trigger the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in young adults and that there might be a variety of mechanisms behind this effect </plain></SENT>
