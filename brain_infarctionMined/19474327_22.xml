<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a transcription factor of the mouse Mn-SOD gene, and elucidated the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(*-) overproduction after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tFCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that Mn-SOD expression is significantly reduced by reperfusion in the cerebral ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that activated STAT3 is usually recruited into the mouse Mn-SOD promoter and upregulates transcription of the mouse Mn-SOD gene in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, at early postreperfusion periods after tFCI, STAT3 was rapidly downregulated, and its recruitment into the Mn-SOD promoter was completely blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, transcriptional activity of the mouse Mn-SOD gene was significantly reduced by STAT3 inhibition in primary cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that STAT3 deactivated by reperfusion induces accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(*-) in mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The loss of STAT3 activity induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by reducing Mn-SOD expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using SOD2-/+ heterozygous knock-out mice, we found that Mn-SOD is a direct target of STAT3 in reperfusion-induced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that STAT3 is a novel transcription factor of the mouse Mn-SOD gene and plays a crucial role as a neuroprotectant in regulating levels of reactive oxygen species in the mouse brain </plain></SENT>
