<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated 42 consecutive patients admitted within 6 hours after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial venous blood samples were taken hourly between 1 to 6 hours, and at 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients lesion topography was assessed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficit was quantified by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale score, and functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>H-FABP and B-FABP concentrations showed peak values already 2 to 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and remained elevated up to last measurements at 120 hours.Unlike BFABP, early H-FABP concentrations were significantly associated with the severity of the neurological deficit and the functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High H-FABP release was associated with large infarction on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study shows for the first time quantitative data of serum BFABP and H-FABP being elevated early in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> indicating that especially H-FABP might have the potential to be a rapid marker of brain damage and clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As both FABPs indicate damage to neuronal and glial tissue but are not specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, further investigations are needed to better understand the prolonged release of both in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which is in contrast to the transient increase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and can not be explained by their renal extraction </plain></SENT>
