<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 26 patients with lesions following ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was studied to find evidence for selective impairments in these three processes using displays with pictures of everyday objects on different locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, object-recognition memory and visuospatial construction was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Corsi Block-Tapping Task and Oxford Stylus Maze Test were included as standard spatial-memory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that of these 26 patients, 8 patients had selective impairments in the aforementioned object-location memory task conditions (both after immediate and delayed testing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data further support the existence of separate cognitive processes within memory for object locations that can be selectively affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
