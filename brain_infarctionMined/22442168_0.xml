<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the interactions of WML volume with SI and MB on gait and postural stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants in a population-based study aged 60 to 86 years underwent brain MRI, computerized gait measurement, and a physiological profile assessment of postural stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Segmentation procedures and standard rating methods were used to measure WML, SI, and MB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear regression was used to test interactions between lesions on gait and postural stability, adjusting for age, sex, and total intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 395 participants (mean age, 72 years; SD, 7.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIs were predominantly located in subcortical frontal white matter and in deep gray structures, and MBs were largely lobar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with SI or MB had higher WML volumes than those without (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of SI (P for interaction=0.01) or MB (P for interaction &lt;0.01) magnified the adverse association of WML volume with gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SI (P for interaction=0.02), but not MB, magnified the adverse association of WML volume with postural stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical cerebrovascular lesions are adversely associated with gait and postural stability in older people in a cumulative fashion </plain></SENT>
