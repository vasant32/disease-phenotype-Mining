<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(Sapindales: Anacardiaceae) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is a <z:chebi fb="47" ids="26848">tannin</z:chebi>-rich herb that is widely used in traditional Korean medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its various pharmacological effects, including its radical-scavenging effects, have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to determine if these radical-scavenging effects can be confirmed using in vitro assays and to investigate its neuroprotective effects, optimal dosage, mechanisms, and therapeutic time window in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Galla Rhois 85% <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> extract (GRE) exhibited potent and dose-dependent radical-scavenging effects on various radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of GRE (300 mg/kg) in a transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rat model (two hours of occlusion followed by 22 hours of reperfusion) reduced the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume by 37.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also improved sensory motor function and reduced <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-peroxidation in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it did not have any inhibitory effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time window study revealed that pre- and co-treatment with GRE had protective effects, but post-treatment with GRE (three or six hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) did not have protective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, GRE had potent radical-scavenging activities and neuroprotective effects in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when it was pre- and co-administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The optimal dosage may be around 300 mg/kg for oral administration </plain></SENT>
