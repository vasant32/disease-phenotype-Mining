<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of functional recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, functional MRI was used to investigate these mechanisms in six right-handed patients with complete recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e>, and nine right-handed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The non-infarcted side of the cerebellum and the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the non-infarcted side of the cerebellum were significantly activated during the infarcted-side hand movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the infarcted side of the cerebellum, intact regions were activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> depends on reorganization in the infarcted side of the cerebellum, and recruitment of the cerebellocortical loop involving the cerebrum ipsilateral to the movement and the cerebellum contralateral to the movement </plain></SENT>
