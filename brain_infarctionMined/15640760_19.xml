<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cannabidiol and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis, significantly decreased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 4 h in the mouse middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol but not cannabidiol were inhibited by SR141716, a cannabinoid CB1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, and were abolished by warming of the animals to the levels observed in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol significantly decreased the rectal temperature, and the hypothermic effect was inhibited by SR141716 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results surely show that the neuroprotective effect of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol are via a CB1 receptor and temperature-dependent mechanisms whereas the neuroprotective effects of cannabidiol are independent of CB1 blockade and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
