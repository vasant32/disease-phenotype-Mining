<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since MK-801, an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor, showed many adverse reactions that hampered its clinical applications, development of safe and effective agent for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is eagerly required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was to investigate the effects of N(1)-(quinolin-2-ylmethyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">butane-1,4-diamine</z:chebi> (QMA), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> analogue, on the in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemic damage </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results also demonstrated that QMA could inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-mediated intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) accumulation in rat primary cortical neurons and reduce brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present report suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> played a crucial role in the pathological processes of cerebral ischemic damage and that QMA or other novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> analogues could be promising therapeutic candidates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by virtue of their anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and antioxidation property </plain></SENT>
