<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The applications of a new segmentation software, Anatomatic, in the evaluation of volumetric measurements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> and the new Medimag 3D software in the evaluation of 3D image representation of infarctions are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These programs are applied to magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of these software packages in making accurate volumetric measurements in 40 patients with right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e>, in determining the correlations between the quantitated lesions and neurological/neuropsychological dysfunctions and in creating realistic 3D views of the infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Anatomatic, reproducible infarction volumes were achieved with ease and within a reasonably fast time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medimag helped achieve realistic 3D representations of the infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared, the semiautomatic segmentation proved to be much faster and yielded higher infarction volumes than the manual segmentation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly positive correlations between the infarction volumes and neurological dysfunctions and neuropsychological deficit (neglect) helped to explain the effect of volumes on the clinical status of the patients </plain></SENT>
