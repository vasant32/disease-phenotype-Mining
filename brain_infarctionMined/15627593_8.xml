<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two patients perfusion imaging (PI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) obtained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was coregistered with BOLD imaging of brain functions acquired when profound recovery had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients suffered from thrombembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> due to dissection of the internal carotid artery (ICA) characterized by a severe PI-DWI mismatch in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following ICA recanalization and clinical recovery BOLD imaging showed task-specific activation adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion within the former PI-DWI mismatch area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data in these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients provide evidence that brain tissue at risk of infarction as shown by the PI-DWI mismatch can survive and, thereby, constitute the major site underlying post-ischemic recovery </plain></SENT>
