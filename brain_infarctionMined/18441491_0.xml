<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We studied the influences of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and its longitudinal progression in healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRI scans were performed on 109 neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults (mean age, 58.6+/-5.8 years), with follow-up at an average of 4.9 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> using the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> index (BAI; the ratio of the brain area to the intracranial area) and the ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> index (VAI; the ratio of the ventricular area to the brain area) on MRI T1-weighted images at the levels of the basal ganglia and lateral ventricle in horizontal sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, BMI, smoking habit, and alcohol consumption between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group and the SBI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BAI was significantly lower at entry for the SBI (+) group than for the SBI (-) group at both the basal ganglia and lateral ventricle levels (basal ganglia level, p=0.02; and lateral ventricle level, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the VAI was significantly higher at entry for the SBI (+) group than for the SBI (-) group at the lateral ventricle level (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the BAI was significantly lower at entry for the hypertensive group than for the non-hypertensive group at the basal ganglia level (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the annual variations of the BAI and VAI between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group and the SBI (+) or hypertensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that the SBI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are accelerating factors for brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
