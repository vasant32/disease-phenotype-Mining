<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the effect of hydrogen gas on hemorrhagic transformation in a rat focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats (n=72) were divided into the following groups: sham; sham treated with hydrogen gas (H(2)); Middle Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Artery Occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO); and MCAO treated with H(2) (MCAO+H(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats received an injection of 50% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> (6 ml/kg i.p.) and underwent MCAO 15 min later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following a 90 min ischemic period, hydrogen was inhaled for 2 h during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured the level of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> at 0 h, 0.5 h, 4 h, and 6 h after <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> and hemorrhagic volumes, neurologic score, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (evaluated by measuring the level of 8 Hydroxyguanosine (8OHG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-Hydroxy-2-Nonenal</z:chebi> (HNE) and nitrotyrosine), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/MMP-9 activity were measured at 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that hydrogen inhalation for 2 h reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and hemorrhagic volumes and improved neurological functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect of hydrogen was accompanied by a reduction of the expression of 8OHG, HNE, and nitrotyrosine and the activity of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a reduction of the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level from 500+/-32.51 to 366+/-68.22 mg/dl at 4 h after <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> injection was observed in hydrogen treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the treatment had no significant effect on the expression of ZO-1, occludin, collagen IV or aquaporin4 (AQP4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, hydrogen gas reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, hemorrhagic transformation, and improved neurological function in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The potential mechanisms of decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels after hydrogen treatment warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
