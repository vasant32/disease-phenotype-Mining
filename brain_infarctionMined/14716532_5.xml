<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the S100b protein increase is marker of brain ischemic sufferance and predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients underwent clinical assessment and cranial computed tomography (CT) 24-48 hours before and 3 months after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S100b serum levels were evaluated before surgery, at cross-clamping, 10 minutes later, at declamping, and 24-48 hours and 10-12 weeks after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased S100b levels were detected in 11 patients (39%); eight (73%) of these patients had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased S100b level correlated with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ( p=0.005), low mini-mental state examination score ( p=0.02), and ischemic infarctions at preoperative CT ( p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slight and transient increased S100b levels were detected in 39% of patients during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein levels increased despite the absence of clinical events during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a failure of compensatory hemodynamic or metabolic mechanisms in peri-ischemic tissue, whose longterm effects on cognition remain to be investigated </plain></SENT>
