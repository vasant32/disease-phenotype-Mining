<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: At diagnosis, the primary clinical manifestations of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or CSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSs are reported to be more prevalent in younger than in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether age-related differences in clinical manifestations are associated with age-related angiographic differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We divided 78 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> before 16 years of age into four 4-year age groups and examined the relationships between age at diagnosis and clinical manifestations and angiographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 4 diagnostic age groups, in those younger than 4 years of age, the prevalence of CSs and of infarctions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images was highest, and along with severity of steno-occlusive lesions of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, the prevalence was significantly higher than that in the next diagnostic age group (4-7 years), though the severity of steno-occlusive lesions in the ICA and the degree of transdural collaterals did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CSs and infarctions did not differ significantly in the 3 oldest diagnostic age groups, whereas ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions and transdural collaterals correlated positively with diagnostic age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of CSs and infarctions in patients diagnosed before 4 years of age is associated with advanced steno-occlusive lesions of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients 4 years of age and older at diagnosis, transdural collaterals develop in parallel with advancement of ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions, which may contribute to the nearly constant prevalence of CSs </plain></SENT>
