<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to investigate the serotonergic tone in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients by IDAP </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IDAP was calculated as the linear amplitude/stimulus intensity function (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASF</z:e>) slope, by measuring the peak-to-peak amplitude of Nl-P2 on four blocks of different stimulus intensities </plain></SENT>
