<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the time he reached the emergency department, clouded consciousness precluded localization of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of brain MRI were initially interpreted as negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmologic examination several hours later disclosed a small vertical ocular misalignment attributed to skew deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding led to careful scrutiny of the upper brainstem on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the diffusion, apparent diffusion coefficient, and exponential apparent diffusion coefficient MRI studies allowed a diagnosis of subtle left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recognition of skew deviation in this setting is important because it may be the most specific indicator of a brainstem lesion </plain></SENT>
