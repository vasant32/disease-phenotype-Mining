<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases, surgery was performed via the posterior petrosal approach, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>neurinomas</z:hpo> were completely removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first case, the haemorrhagic infarction was considered to have resulted from transection of the tentorial sinus, the presence of which had not been predictable by preoperative angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second case, the haemorrhagic infarction was caused by a coagulation of the petrosal vein, which was firmly adherent to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the posterior petrosal approach, meticulous care is necessary to preserve the deep anastomotic veins into and around the cerebellar tentorium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereby, catastrophic morbidity related to compromised deep cerebral venous outflow can be avoided </plain></SENT>
