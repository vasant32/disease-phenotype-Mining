<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quantitative diffusion value in ipsilateral cerebral peduncle of patients with differing motor function abilities and analyse the thresholds discriminating the poor motor function disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty-nine patients who previously suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent diffusion tensor imaging examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Motor function was evaluated 8 months after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of cerebral peduncle and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio and FA ratio of patients with different motor function scales were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ipsilateral FA value and FA ratio were distinctly different in patients with different motor function scales, and significantly correlated with the motor function scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference of ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio, and neither had correlation with motor function scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with poor motor function scale could be discriminated by the cutoff value of ipsilateral FA of 0.453 and FA ratio of 0.623 with sensitivity of 90%, 75% and specificity of 88.9%, 88.9% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ipsilateral FA value and FA ratio were feasible and better imaging indices in discriminating patients with poor motor function ability </plain></SENT>
