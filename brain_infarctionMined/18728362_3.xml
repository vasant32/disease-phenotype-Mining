<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 76 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (&lt;12 h from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) were enrolled during a 1-year period (n = 76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between those who received (group A; n = 29) or did not receive (group B; n = 47) IV rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: END/favorable outcomes were observed in 24/31% of the subjects in group A and 21/23% in group B (p = 0.77/0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis of the etiologic subtype of small-vessel occlusion showed that END/favorable outcomes were observed in about 33/33% and 15/19% of the patients in groups A and B, respectively (p = 0.21/0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors showed that the use of rtPA in cases of no lysible clots might not affect the END and favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
