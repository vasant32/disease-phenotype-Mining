<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the negative results of the international Bypass Study, extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery is infrequently employed in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Newly acquired evidence concerning the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, however, has facilitated the identification of a small subgroup of patients with "hemodynamic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristically, these patients demonstrate severely impaired cerebrovascular reserve capacity due to occlusive disease and insufficient collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over an 8-year period, 28 patients were defined by clinical and laboratory criteria as suffering from hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had recurring episodes of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography (CT) scans either were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or showed evidence of border zone infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular reserve capacity was studied using 133Xe single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge and was found to be significantly impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these criteria, superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was performed to augment collateral flow to the ischemic hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, one 4 days and the other 2 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died from massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and another suffered a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with incomplete recovery, resulting in a major morbidity and mortality rate of 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minor morbidity included one patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> who subsequently recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful in 23 patients (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up period of almost 3 years, no patient had another episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bypass patency was confirmed by postoperative angiography in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve capacity showed significant improvement of the latter while the resting CBF was essentially unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In view of these findings, the authors conclude that EC-IC bypass surgery constitutes appropriate therapy for a subgroup of patients with recurrent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, defined using the strict selection criteria employed in this study </plain></SENT>
