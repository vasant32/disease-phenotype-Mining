<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined cross-sectional relations of stress-induced BP reactivity to silent cerebrovascular disease assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-seven nondemented, community-dwelling older adults (ages 55 to 81; 75% male) free of major medical, neurological, or psychiatric disease, engaged in: (1) clinical assessment of resting systolic and diastolic BP; (2) assessment of systolic and diastolic BP responses to 3 laboratory-based mental stressors; and (3) MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRIs were rated for small silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (&gt; or =3 mm), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-like lesions (&lt;3 mm), and periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for age, gender, resting clinic BP, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels, higher systolic BP reactivity was associated with an increased number of small silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (r2=0.14; P=0.004) and greater severity ratings of periventricular (r2=0.08; P&lt;0.04) and deep WMH (r2=0.06; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher diastolic BP reactivity was similarly associated with an increased number of small silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (r2=0.08; P&lt;0.04), and greater severity ratings of periventricular (r2=0.08; P&lt;0.04) and deep WMH (r2=0.11; P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that greater stress-induced BP reactivity is associated with enhanced silent cerebrovascular disease on MRI in healthy asymptomatic older adults independent of resting BP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exaggerated stress-induced BP reactivity warrants further examination as a potential biobehavioral risk factor for cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
