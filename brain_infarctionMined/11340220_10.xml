<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the relationship of carotid artery lesions (CALs), with and without acoustic shadowing (AS), to incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> events in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 13 123 men and women aged 45 to 64 years, and free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, examined during 1986-1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over an average follow-up time of 8.0 years, 226 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> cases (thromboembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e>) were identified and classified by a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three levels of exposure were defined on the basis of the presence of B-mode ultrasound-detected CALs and AS in a 3-cm segment of the carotid arteries centered at the bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> adjusted for age, ethnicity, and study site for women with a CAL without AS, compared with those without a CAL, was 1.92 (95% CI, 1.23, 3.01), and the hazard ratio comparing those with a CAL with AS with those without a CAL was 4.01 (95% CI, 2.28, 7.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corresponding hazard ratios for men were 1.99 (95% CI, 1.36, 2.91) and 2.23 (95% CI, 1.32, 3.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although adjustment for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> medication, systolic blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> score, fibrinogen, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen, and smoking status attenuated these associations somewhat, when compared with no evidence of CALs, CALs with AS remained statistically significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in women, while CALs without AS were predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: B-mode ultrasound-detected CALs and AS serve as markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and thus are predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
