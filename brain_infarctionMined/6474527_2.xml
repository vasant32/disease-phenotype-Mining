<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven anticoagulated patients, six with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and one nonanticoagulated patient with a small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> abruptly worsened from eight hours to 11 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with CT revealing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> or severe HI </plain></SENT>
