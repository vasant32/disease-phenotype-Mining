<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A reversible model of focal thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was developed in the rat and examined for histological evidence of reperfusion injury after clinically relevant times of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The distal middle cerebral artery of 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded by 562-nm laser-driven photothrombosis for 0.5, 2, and 3 hours or permanently (each n=7) and was recanalized by 355-nm UV laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occlusive material was examined by transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical cerebral blood flow was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were examined histologically at 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After occlusion, cortical cerebral blood flow was reduced to 33+/-4% of baseline for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and was restored to 82+/-9%, 75+/-3%, and 93+/-7% of baseline for the 0.5-, 2-, and 3-hour groups, respectively, following recanalization after 29+/-8, 38+/-20, and 70+/-33 minutes of UV laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic occlusion contained compactly aggregated platelets but no fibrin, with length (1.2 to 1.8 mm) proportional to the ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During recanalization, microchannels containing erythrocytes and scattered leukocytes and bordered by intact disaggregated platelets infiltrated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes (mm3) at 3 days were 12+/-3 for the permanent case and 8+/-4, 24+/-3, and 30+/-9 for the 0.5-, 2-, and 3-hour cases, respectively, thus demonstrating reperfusion injury histologically in the latter 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: UV laser-facilitated dissolution of a conventionally refractory platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> provides a novel and effective method for restoring blood flow without hemorrhagic complications during thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was the first observation of histologically confirmed reperfusion injury in such a model </plain></SENT>
