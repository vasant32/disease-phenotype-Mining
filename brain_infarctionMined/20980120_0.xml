<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physicians should have a high index of suspicion and prompt appropriate investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 22-year-old healthy African American man presented with a 2-day history of constant occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and ambulatory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical examination showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo>, slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010544'>vertical nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the right cerebellum in the distribution of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography of the neck showed focal dissection of the right vertebral artery at C1 through C2 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On subsequent questioning, the patient recollected riding a roller coaster 2 weeks before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was started, and the patient was bridged to oral <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a 5-day uneventful hospital course, symptoms improved and patient was discharged on oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cervicocephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> after roller coaster rides are rarely described in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The acceleration and abrupt changes of direction might lead to indirect trauma that is applied to mobile portions of the cervicocephalic arteries leading to intimal tears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography combined with axial T1-weighted cervical MRI is preferred because it is a high-sensitive, noninvasive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rationale for the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> or antiplatelets in patients with cervicocephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> is to prevent early recurrence and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, a meta-analysis failed to show significant difference in the rates of disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the decision for medical treatment should be made in a case-by-case basis </plain></SENT>
