<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is known that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, which has been used for severe brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or head injury as a brain protective drug, inhibits the increase of free fatty acids (FFAs) liberated from membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of FFA liberation from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and the mode of action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we have investigated the effects of induction of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> pretreatment upon <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> was evoked by rat decapitation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> (60 mg/kg) was administered i.p. for 15 min prior to decapitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removed brains were incubated for 1, 5, 15 or 30 min at 37 degrees C and then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After extraction of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> from the brains, neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> compositions were analyzed by thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that FFAs, either unsaturated or saturated, were rapidly accumulated in the brain during early period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but attenuated significantly by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">Pentobarbital</z:chebi> attenuated the accumulations of stearic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acids</z:chebi>, with little effect on palmitic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diacylglycerol (DG), which is considered to be as a plausible candidate for the source of FFA, was also produced in the ischemic brain, and its acyl chain composition was similar to that of liberated FFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase of DG was inhibited significantly by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> attenuated the accumulation of DG enriched in arachidonic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This fatty acyl composition resembled the principal composition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in rat brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
