<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological signs and prognosis of patients with localized lesions in the vicinity of Broca's area of the left inferior frontal gyrus have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied periodic changes in the neuropsychological signs of four patients who had relatively localized lesions in the vicinity of Broca's area and manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> of the non-fluent type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ages of the four patients at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were 62, 66, 30 and 37 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The localized lesions in their brains were the result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> revealed by CT scans, and included so-called Broca's center in the left inferior frontal gyrus along with adjacent brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychological signs of the four patients were periodically assessed by means of the standard language test of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (SLTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, they had moderate difficulties in speaking to explain test materials or recall words and mild difficulties in reading aloud, repeating and writing words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One year later, most of their neuropsychological signs disappeared except for mild difficulties in speaking fluently and recalling words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It should be noted, however, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients were able to return to their previous occupations one or two years later, because they had recovered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the neuropsychological signs of Broca's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> caused by relatively localized lesions in the left inferior frontal gyrus are mild and largely disappear within one or two years </plain></SENT>
