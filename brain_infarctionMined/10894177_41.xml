<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was studied in mice using multiparametric imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One-hour focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by occluding the middle cerebral artery using the intraluminal filament technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protein synthesis (CPS) and the regional tissue content of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) were measured after recirculation times from 0 hours to 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed changes were correlated with the expression of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of hsp-70, c-fos, and junB, as well as the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks, visualized by TUNEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of 1 hour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, protein synthesis was suppressed in a larger tissue volume than ATP in accordance with the biochemical differentiation between core and penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was selectively expressed in the cortical penumbra, whereas c-fos and junB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were increased both in the lateral part of the penumbra and in the ipsilateral cingulate cortex with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion after withdrawal of the intraluminal filament, suppression of CPS persisted except in the most peripheral parts of the middle cerebral artery territory, in which it recovered between 6 hours and 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATP, in contrast, returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels within 1 hour but secondarily deteriorated from 3 hours on until, between 1 and 3 days, the ATP-depleted area merged with that of suppressed protein synthesis leading to delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hsp70 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, but not c-fos and junB, was strongly expressed during reperfusion, peaking at 3 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells were detected from 3 hours on, mainly in areas with secondary ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results stress the importance of an early recovery of CPS for the prevention of ischemic injury and suggest that TUNEL is an unspecific response of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
