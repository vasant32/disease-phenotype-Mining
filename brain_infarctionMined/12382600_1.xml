<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous findings suggest that self-rated function predicts future functional decline and is strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the strength of the relationship of self-rated function to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was in part due to functional decline, such as would occur with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Self-ratings of function and health (on a 5-point scale, ranging from excellent to poor) were assessed annually on 630 participants in the Nun Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality surveillance extended from October 31, 1991 to March 1, 1998, and, among those who died, neuropathological examination determined postmortem evidence of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression modeling with self-rated function and health as time-dependent covariates and stratification by assessment period were used in these analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Self-rated function and health ratings of good, fair, and poor were significantly associated with doubling of the risk of mortality, compared with ratings of very good and excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Self-rated function ratings of fair or poor were associated with a threefold increase in the risk of mortality with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but self-rated function and health ratings of fair and poor were comparable in their association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and mortality without brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Self-rated function was significantly associated with mortality with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, suggesting that brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may be experienced as functional loss but not recognized or labeled as disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that self-rated function and health should be explored simultaneously in future research </plain></SENT>
