<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND Diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI is recommended in UK guidelines to evaluate minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, yet can produce negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors determined the rate of negative MRI (including DWI) and associated features in patients presenting to hospital with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a prospective observational cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischaemic lacunar or minor cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors performed MRI (DWI, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2* and T1) as soon as possible after presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors used multivariate analysis to determine predictors of negative DWI and MRI (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gold standard for clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was the opinion of an expert panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors recruited 246 patients, mean age 68.1 years (SD 11.6 years), 162 were males (66%), and the median NIHSS was 2 (range 0 to 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scan was 12 days (IQR 4-27 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one patients (33%) did not show any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients (24%) did not show the recent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on MRI (DWI/T2/FLAIR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With multivariate analysis, less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, younger age, female gender and increased time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to scan were associated with negative DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With multivariate analysis, younger age and female gender were associated with negative MRI (DWI or T2 or FLAIR) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of negative MRI and DWI among patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (a third) which has important management and research implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A negative MRI or DWI does not exclude the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
