<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an essential part in the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several methods have been established to monitor cerebral perfusion in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During last few years, a new sonographic approach has been introduced, the so called 'angle independent ultrasound system' for monitoring volume flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angle independent Doppler ultrasound system Quantix ND (Cardiosonix Ltd, Israel) determines the diameter of the ICA as well as the velocity of blood flow in the extracranial part of this vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, a determination of the global CBF in the anterior circulation can be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aim of our study was to compare the Quantix ND system and the commonly used transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in patients suffering from aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We included 11 patients (eight female and three male; Hunt and Hess I-V) and performed post-operatively/post-interventionally daily measurement of blood flow volume in the ICA, and determined the blood flow velocity in middle and anterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA) with TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients post-operatively/post-interventionally developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e>, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and territorial infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients were chosen as case studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the TCD, we found a strong significant correlation of blood flow volume with Quantix ND in the ICA and the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These preliminary data justify further investigation of this angle independent Doppler ultrasound device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We postulate that this new tool might be effective for monitoring the CBF in the critical post-operative/post-interventional interval following aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
