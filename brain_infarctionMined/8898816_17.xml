<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short-term electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings have shown similar abnormalities of heart rate variability in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there is no information regarding the clinical significance of these abnormalities and of heart rate variability in long-term ECG recordings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, we analyzed the time domain and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability from 24-hour ECG recordings in 31 consecutive patients with hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and at 1 and 6 months after the infarction and in 31 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the measured components of heart rate variability, ie, standard deviation of RR intervals (P &lt; .001), total power (P &lt; .0001), very-low-frequency power (P &lt; .0001), low-frequency power (P &lt; .001), and high-frequency power (P &lt; .05), were significantly lower than those of the control subjects in both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and 1 and 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Impaired heart rate variability correlated with the severity of neurological deficits and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> due to large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, no relevant spectral components were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> seems to cause significant long-lasting damage to the cardiovascular autonomic regulatory system manifested as abnormalities of heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distorted heart rate variability in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be prognostically unfavorable </plain></SENT>
