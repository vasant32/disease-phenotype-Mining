<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A set of growth-associated genes important in axonal sprouting in peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system regeneration and cortical development has recently been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of these growth-associated genes were defined during the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> axonal sprouting response using a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in barrel field cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> induces sequential waves of neuronal growth-promoting genes during the sprouting response: an early expression peak (SPRR1), a mid expression peak (p21, Ta1 tubulin, L1, MARCKS), a late peak (SCG10, SCLIP), and an early/sustained pattern (GAP43, CAP23, c-jun) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These expression peaks correspond to specific time points in the sprouting response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of the growth-inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> aggrecan, brevican, versican, and phosphacan are induced late in the sprouting process; except neurocan, which is increased during the peak of the growth-promoting gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The developmentally associated growth inhibitors ephrin-A5, ephB1, semaphorin IIIa, and neuropilin 1 are also induced in the early phases of the sprouting response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi>, in the form of peri-neuronal nets, are reduced in the region of axonal sprouting, during the peak of growth-promoting gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results identify a unique profile of growth-promoting gene expression in adult cortex after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the inhibitory molecules that are present during the sprouting response, and a region in which growth-promoting genes are increased, growth-inhibitory proteins are diminished and axonal sprouting occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This region may be a growth-promoting zone after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
