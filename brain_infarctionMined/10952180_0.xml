<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out repeat MRI on 12 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the cerebellum or basal ganglia with a short T1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar cortical lesions showed high signal on T1-weighted spin-echo images beginning at 2 weeks, which became prominent from 3 weeks to 2 months, and persisted for as long as 14 months after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basal ganglia lesions demonstrated slightly high signal from a week after the ictus, which became more intense thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signal intensity began to fade gradually after 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High signal could be seen at the periphery until 5 months, and then disappeared, while low or isointense signal, seen in the central portion from day 20, persisted thereafter </plain></SENT>
