<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Overall 30 patients who suffered ischemic brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were examined for cerebral and central hemodynamics by radiocerebrography (RC) with the aid of the radiopharmaceutical preparation Tx-99 and by radiocardiography (RCG) using 131I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These methods were employed simultaneously with computer-aided tomography, cerebral angiography, rheoencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group was made up of 18 patients suffering from peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients with a favourable outcome of ischemic brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the recovery of work fitness, the RC and RCG readings did not practically differ from those in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 19 patients with disability due to brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> demonstrated deceleration of the cerebral blood flow, most pronounced on the side of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry of the cerebral blood flow and deceleration of blood supply in the main and intracerebral vessels as shown by the RC readings turned out the signs of the hemodynamically significant stenosis of one of the internal carotid arteries, even in lack of the changes on the angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlation was established between deterioration of central hemodynamics and deceleration of the cerebral blood flow, as was a possibility of an increase of the blood inflow to the brain after administering drugs that make the RCG readings return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
