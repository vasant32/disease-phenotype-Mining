<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The details of the relationship between brain function and metabolism in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI), we localized sources of abnormal magnetic activities in ischemic brain regions and biochemical changes in suspected lesions showing pathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were examined and the results of MEG and 1H MRSI were superimposed onto the corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The signal intensities of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> (NA) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (Lac) were measured in the lesions with highly concentrated dipoles of slow wave activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 12 cases had increased slow wave activity in the cortical areas adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; 1 case was excluded because the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was too small (&lt;1 cm in diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signal intensity of NA in the regions with the highest slow wave activity was significantly reduced and was well correlated with the dipole density of slow waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Though Lac was mildly accumulated in the lesions, the Lac level had no correlation with slow wave magnetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining and metabolically active cortical tissue showing NA signal produced the abnormal slow wave activity under <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> (mild accumulation of Lac) </plain></SENT>
