<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these cases "spontaneous" dissections, intended as non-traumatic, represent about 34% of posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> in patients aged less than 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here describe the case of a seven-year-old boy who developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spontaneous vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (VAD) leading to occipito-mesial, thalamo-capsular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once a traumatic origin was excluded, clinical history and laboratory findings were further analysed: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> during the previous week, raised inflammatory indices, a throat culture positive for beta haemolysing Streptococcus group A and high titres of streptococcal antibodies were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that patients with CAD referred as spontaneous deserve extensive analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects presenting with a dissection and an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are likely to have a hyperinflammatory response (although further experience is needed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients immediate start of antibiotic therapy, treatment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> and further a lifelong prophylaxis with antibiotics before any invasive procedure are strongly recommended </plain></SENT>
