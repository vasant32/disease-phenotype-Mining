<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to modify the photochemical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model of Watson et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[23] so as to make possible microscopical investigation of the so-called penumbra, a tissue zone at risk that surrounds an infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The idea was to minimize photochemical challenge to endothelial membranes in such a way that thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> is avoided but destabilization of the blood-brain barrier is still obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphological examination of the challenged area revealed open blood vessels, overt blood-brain barrier leakage over the entire area, severely swollen glial cells and structurally intact neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion expanded over time due to progressive extravasation, formation of perivascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and consequent development of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> through mechanical compression and microvascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a photothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, in which the ischemic insult is more severe and blood vessels are completely congested by aggregated platelets, with this approach blood flow is partially preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this way, an ischemic penumbra is created that mimics pathologic conditions secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The model may be useful in studying effects of drugs on pathologic phenomena that are characteristic of a penumbra, e.g. vasogenic and cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and infarction </plain></SENT>
