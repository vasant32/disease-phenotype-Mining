<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) is often found with white matter hyperintensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent genetic study on elderly twins indicated that the susceptibility to white matter hyperintensity was largely determined by genetic factors, implying the existence of genetic susceptibility for SBI as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied 3 genetic polymorphisms in SBI, the deletion/insertion polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [apo(a)] size polymorphism, and the T677C polymorphism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene, by a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By MRI, 147 subjects with SBI and 214 without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> (control group) were selected from participants of a health examination of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> (SSI) from the same area were also included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to the control group, 2 more reference populations were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Typing of the apo(a) size polymorphism was done by Western blotting with the use of an anti-apo(a) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotypes of ACE and MTHFR were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the genomic DNA and subsequent restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ACE polymorphism was not associated with either SBI or SSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the small apo(a) was associated with both SSI and SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR polymorphism was associated only with SSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of MTHFR and apo(a) was greater in the younger subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among the 3 genetic polymorphisms studied, only the apo(a) size polymorphism is a risk factor for SBI </plain></SENT>
