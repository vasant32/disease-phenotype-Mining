<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to determine the ability to predict <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> age based on decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively identified 94 individuals (age range 16 years to 91 years; mean 63.7 + 14.1 years) who underwent magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging at our institution over a course of 14 months whose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> age could be reliably determined within 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single observer measured <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values within the center of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and compared them against values in contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the ability of four <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease thresholds (i.e., &gt;50%, &gt;40%, &gt;30%, and &gt;20%) to predict <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> age of &lt;24 and &lt;48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were as follows: &lt;20%, n = 9; 20-29%, n = 21; 30-39%, n = 25; 40-49%, n = 23; &gt;50%, n = 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For prediction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> age &lt;24 h, sensitivity for the four <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decrease thresholds ranged from 25% to 94%, specificity ranged from 10% to 85%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) ranged from 18% to 25%, and negative predictive value (NPV) ranged from 85% to 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For prediction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> age &lt;48 h, sensitivity ranged from 23% to 98%, specificity ranged from 15% to 87%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> ranged from 46% to 56%, and NPV ranged from 60% to 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Test performance characteristics for predicting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> age of &lt;24 and &lt;48 h were relatively poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> was very low for predicting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> &lt;24 h old </plain></SENT>
