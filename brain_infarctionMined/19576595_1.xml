<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of a hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) on baseline brain CT is associated with poor clinical outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains uncertain whether the presence of HMCAS is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deterioration after tPA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of HMCAS in routinely intravenous tPA-treated patients with anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological deterioration, the 3-month functional outcome and the occurrence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit registry of 384 consecutive patients with anterior circulation infarction, treated with intravenous tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were used to assess if HMCAS was independently associated with predefined outcome definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a HMCAS in 104 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HMCAS was related to the risk of early neurological deterioration (p=0.04) and poor functional outcome (p&lt;0.001) on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was not significantly different between patients with and without HMCAS (7% versus 6%, p=0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariable analysis, the presence of HMCAS was significantly associated with a poor outcome (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HMCAS is associated with early neurological deterioration and poor functional outcome, but not with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
