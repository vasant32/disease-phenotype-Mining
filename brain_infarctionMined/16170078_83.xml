<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The endogenous, highly selective, IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) protects against ischaemic cerebral injury in a range of experimental settings, and IL-1ra causes a marked reduction of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when administered peripherally or at a delay in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917805,C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the first randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of recombinant human IL-1ra (rhIL-1ra) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients within 6 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were randomised to rhIL-1ra or matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Test treatment was administered intravenously by a 100 mg loading dose over 60 seconds, followed by a 2 mg/kg/h infusion over 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded for up to 3 months, serial blood samples were collected for biological markers up to 3 months, and 5-7 day brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No adverse events were attributed to study treatment among 34 patients randomised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Markers of biological activity, including neutrophil and total white cell counts, C reactive protein, and IL-6 concentrations, were lower in rhIL-1ra treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, clinical outcomes at 3 months in the rhIL-1ra treated group were better than in placebo treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that rhIL-1ra is safe and well tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, rhIL-1ra exhibited biological activity that is relevant to the pathophysiology and clinical outcome of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings identify rhIL-1ra as a potential new therapeutic agent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
