<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 63 patients with embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> identified during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were not randomized because of specific exclusion criteria or delayed identification more than 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 45 patients who were randomized, 44 patients (98%) completed the initial week of the protocol: 24 were immediately heparinized at an average of 32 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 21 received no immediate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed delayed hemorrhagic infarction and two patients experienced early recurrent embolism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> among the nonanticoagulated group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT in 40 of these patients showed late developing hemorrhagic infarction in two additional patients (5%) </plain></SENT>
