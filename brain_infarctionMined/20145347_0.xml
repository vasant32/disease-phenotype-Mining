<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in paroxysmal AF patients on rhythm control therapy who were stratified by their CHADS2 score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 334 NVAF atients (229 men and 105 women, mean age, 68 +/- 12 years, mean follow-up period, 60 +/- 35 months) who were categorized into low risk (score 0), moderate risk (1 or 2), and high risk (3 or more) groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low, moderate, and high risk groups accounted for 34%, 50%, and 16% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 257 patients without <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy, the annual rate of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was 0.6% in the score 0 group, 0.5% in the score 1 group, 3.1% in the score 2 group, and 9.6% in the score 3 or more group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 77 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (target PT-INR: 1.6-3.0), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 0% in the score 0 group, 0% in the score 1 group, 1.4% in the score 2 group, and 6.6% in the score 3 or more group </plain></SENT>
