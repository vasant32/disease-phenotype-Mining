<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage (&lt;5 days) evolution of the watershed infarction (WI) on diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging and to evaluate the role of perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in predicting the progression of watershed infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> WI within 24 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Criterion for WI was based on DW images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume changes between the initial and follow-up (mean: 2.2 days) DW images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion images were obtained in 20 patients at the initial work-up and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of perfusion-diffusion mismatch in predicting severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> progression were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was assessed by using National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes on initial and follow-up DW images were 8.6+/-7.7 cm3 and 20.2+/-27.0 cm3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases showed no or slight increment (&lt;15 cm3) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and seven cases showed severe progression (&gt;15 cm3 increment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 20 cases in which perfusion maps were obtained, 5 cases showed perfusion-diffusion mismatch: among those, 4 developed severe progression of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe progression group showed higher follow-up NIHSS score and poor outcome by 90-day mRS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WI usually begins as a small volume lesion, and progression of infarction during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage is usually limited in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perfusion imaging may have an important role in predicting severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> progression in WI </plain></SENT>
