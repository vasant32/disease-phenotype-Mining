<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we assess the neuroprotective efficacy of tacrolimus in a nonhuman primate model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, photochemically induced thrombotic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in cynomolgus monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment, tacrolimus (0.01, 0.032, or 0.1 mg/kg) was intravenously administered immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, and neurologic deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volumes were assessed 24 hours after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus dose-dependently reduced neurologic deficits and infarction volume in the cerebral cortex, with statistically significant amelioration of neurologic deficits at 0.032 and 0.1 mg/kg and significant reduction of infarction at 0.1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, the long-term efficacy of tacrolimus on neurologic deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vehicle-treated monkeys exhibited persistent and severe deficits in motor and sensory function for up to 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single intravenous bolus injection of tacrolimus (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg) produced long-lasting amelioration of neurologic deficits and significant reduction of infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have provided compelling evidence that a single dose of tacrolimus not only reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> but also ameliorates long-term neurologic deficits in a nonhuman primate model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, strengthening the view that tacrolimus might be beneficial in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
