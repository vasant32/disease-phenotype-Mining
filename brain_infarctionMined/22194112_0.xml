<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Foramina transversaria (FT) are located on the transverse processes of cervical vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These foramina are known to exhibit variations with regard to size, shape and may even be absent or duplicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study are to investigate the shape, size and variations of FT in an ancient population and to point out the importance of double FT in the human <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: 262 ancient skeletons, dated 6th c AD, were unearthed from the Iasos Archaeological site between 1979 and 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these skeletons, 22 cervical vertebrae belonging to 21 individual skeletons were examined for the variations of FT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen (68.2%) of the skeletons were male and 6 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the FT were round in shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 22 cervical vertebrae, double FT was found in 5 (22.7%) vertebrae, while unilateral in 3 and bilateral in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asymmetrical FT was observed only in one (4.5%) vertebra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of FT was 6.2 mm in the right side and 6.4 mm in the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Double FT exists since the antiquity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recognition of this variation provides safety and effectiveness for the posterior approaches of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
