<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The persistence of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian forebrain suggests that endogenous precursors may be a potential source for neuronal replacement after injury or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) can facilitate neural precursor proliferation in the adult rodent subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the application of EGF and bFGF was found to boost neurogenesis after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in this study we investigated whether a combined intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) EGF/bFGF treatment over a period of 2 weeks affects the proliferation of newly generated cells in the endothelin-1 model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As assessed by toluidine blue staining, EGF/bFGF substantially increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) i.c.v. application revealed an EGF/bFGF-induced increase in cell proliferation in the lateral ventricle 14 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation in the striatum increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas in the dentate gyrus and in the dorsal 3rd ventricle the number of cells decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the neuronal fate of these cells by co-staining with a doublecortin (DCX) antibody showed that the growth factors concomitantly nearly doubled early neurogenesis in the ipsilateral striatum in ischemic animals but diminished it in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and unclear long-term outcome further modifications of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment schedule are needed before final conclusions concerning the perspectives of such an approach can be made </plain></SENT>
