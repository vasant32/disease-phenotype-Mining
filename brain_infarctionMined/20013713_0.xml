<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (SVCI) vs. mild stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> patients (AD), using the Weschler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) word lists test, to examine the adequacy of this test to show the different memory patterns in this population, that could contribute to early differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three groups of patients were compared: AD (n = 25), SVCI-leukoaraiosis (n = 17) and SVCI-multi <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three groups did not differ in age, education or severity of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with SVCI showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in free recall with an improvement in their performance on the recognition task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AD group, however, showed low scores in free recall as in recognition tasks, with a major number of false positive errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were also found between the SVCI-leukoaraiosis and SVCI-multi <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> groups, with the latter showing the best performance in long term retention and a minor trend to respond with false positive errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The WMS-III word lists test is a good instrument to differentiate the memory profile between SVCI and AD, with the recognition task being the most discriminative one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The worst impairment in leukoaraiosis patients in comparison to the multi <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> group, suggests that white matter diffuse lesion could affect more directly the recall processes mediatised by the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
