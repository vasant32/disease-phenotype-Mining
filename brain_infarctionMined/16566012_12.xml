<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 12-lead electrocardiograms of 493 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (BI) proved by an magnetic resonance imaging and 493 control subjects matched for age, sex, and center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insular involvement (insula (+/-)) was assessed by two independent readings of the magnetic resonance imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were followed for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> BI was independently associated with heart rate (&lt; or = 64 beats/min), abnormal repolarization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and ventricular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular ectopic beats</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower heart rate in BI patients was due to an interaction with smoking (p for interaction = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insula(+) group was significantly associated with abnormal repolarization with no interaction with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> by history was also more frequent in the insula(+) than in the insula(-) group (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular history, and handicap at admission, right insula(+) BI was significantly associated with 2-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-3.52) and with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis including age, sex, cardiovascular history, handicap at admission, and lesion side, increased QTc interval and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and vascular mortality at 2 years in right insula(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings support the notion that right insular involvement may lead to electrocardiographic abnormalities with potential prognostic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This could be important for optimal care in patients with right insular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
