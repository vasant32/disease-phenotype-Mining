<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>Acidosis</z:hpo> was induced either by homogenization and incubation of rat cortical homogenates in acidified buffers or by submitting hyperglycemic rats to complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a procedure that leads to intracellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of low molecular weight species (LMWS) iron was measured after filtration of tissue homogenates through a 10,000 Mr ultrafiltration membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When cortical tissue was homogenized in buffer pH 7, the level of LMWS iron was equal to 0.21 microgram/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was significantly enhanced by acidification of the homogenization medium, reaching 0.34 microgram/g at pH 6 and 0.75 microgram/g at pH 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the tissue was homogenized in water, the LMWS iron level reached 0.17 microgram/g in normoglycemic rats and 0.38 microgram/g (p &lt; .05) in hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both aerobic incubation of homogenates for 1 h at 37 degrees C and inclusion of EDTA in the homogenization medium led to further increases in the iron level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to demonstrate the deleterious role of iron in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, the effect of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35545">bipyridyl</z:chebi>, an iron-chelating agent, was assessed by measuring regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> by the specific gravity method, 24 h following induction of thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment significantly attenuated the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, reducing the water content of the infarcted area by about 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that a significant component of brain ischemic injury involves an iron-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
