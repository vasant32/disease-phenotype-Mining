<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the ischemic crisis activates a cascade of events that are potentiated by reperfusion, eventually leading to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chief aim in this study was to investigate whether our new experimental model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy, flushing the ischemic territory with saline before reperfusion, could minimize this damage by (1) reducing the inflammatory reaction and (2) improving regional microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=39) was induced by a 2-hour middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with the use of a novel intraluminal hollow filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before 48-hour reperfusion, 20 of the ischemic rats received 7 mL isotonic saline at 23 degrees C or 37 degrees C infused into the ischemic area through the filament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow in cortex supplied by the right middle cerebral artery was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>Leukocyte infiltration</z:mp>, microvascular plugging, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were compared with the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was determined by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the prereperfusion infusion of saline, significantly (P&lt;0.001) improved cerebral blood flow (105+/-12% of baseline) was obtained up to 48 hours after reperfusion, compared with 45+/-7% at 24 hours and 25+/-3% at 48 hours after reperfusion without local saline infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant (P&lt;0.001) reductions in <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> (61%), vascular plugging (45%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (approximately 65%), and neurological deficits were also produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region was significantly (P&lt;0.05) minimized by 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and neurological deficits may be attributed to adequate reperfusion and ameliorated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> induced by local prereperfusion infusion </plain></SENT>
