<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a register-based cohort study of nearly 3 million working people (age 30-64 years in 1990) with a 13-year follow-up (1991-2003) for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (50 114 events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Job control was aggregated to the data by a secondary data source (job-exposure matrix) in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gender-specific Cox regressions were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age- and workhour-adjusted hazard ratio of the lowest versus the highest job control quartile was 1.25 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.17-1.32] for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1.33 (95% CI 1.15-1.55) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 1.22 (95% CI 1.14-1.31) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> among the women, and the corresponding figures for the men were 1.24 (95% CI 1.21-1.28), 1.30 (95% CI 1.21-1.40), 1.23 (95% CI 1.19-1.28), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for education, marital status, and income attenuated these associations to 1.07 (95% CI 1.01-1.14) for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1.22 (95% CI 1.04-1.42) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 1.04 (95% CI 0.97-1.12) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> for the women and to 1.08 (95% CI 1.04-1.12), 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.22), 1.08 (95% CI 1.04-1.13), respectively, for the men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher in low job-control occupations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between job control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes varied as a function of gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was highest for the women in low job-control occupations </plain></SENT>
