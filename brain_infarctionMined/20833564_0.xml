<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a comparative study of VBD and non-VBD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, we aimed to elucidate the clinicoradiologic features of VBD patients in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 481 consecutive patients (302 men and 179 women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were admitted to our department between 2007 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 481 inpatients, 374 (231 men and 143 women) had brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (BI), and 107 (71 men and 36 women) had brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (BH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed medical records, and VBD was diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk profile, modified Rankin scale score at 30 days poststroke, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions were compared among 4 groups: the VBD BI group, the VBD BH group, the non-VBD BI group, and the non-VBD BH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diameter, height, and lateral displacement of the basilar artery (BA) were analyzed in the VBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses used multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VBD was found in 37 patients (34 men and 3 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age (± SD) was 64.4 ± 14.7 years (63.4 ± 14.6 years in men and 65.3 ± 6.1 years in women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (21 men and 3 women) had BI, and 13 men had BH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were significant male preferences in VBD BI (P &lt; .01) and VBD BH patients (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean age (± SD) was 67.7 ± 14.3 years in BI patients and 56.7 ± 12.7 years in BH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The VBD BH men were significantly younger than the non-VBD BH men (P &lt; .05) and VBD BI men (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Frequency of current smoking was significantly greater in VBD BI patients compared with non-VBD BI patients (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors did not differ among the 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mean modified Rankin Scale score was significantly higher in VBD BH men compared with non-VBD BH men and VBD BI men (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The height and lateral displacement of the BA were scored more severely in BH patients than in BI patients (P &lt; .01), but BA diameter did not differ between BH and BI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The frequency of pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was 3-fold greater in VBD BI (P &lt; .05) and VBD BH patients (P &lt; .005) compared with non-VBD BI and BH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate a VBD prevalence of 7.7% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, 6.4% in BI patients, and 12.1% in BH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Our clinicoradiologic analyses suggest male predominance, younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BH, and higher frequency of pontine lesions in VBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Significant BA changes and poor outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were found in patients with hemorrhagic VBD rather than ischemic VBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, more attention should be paid to risk and care of BH in VBD patients, in addition to those of BI </plain></SENT>
