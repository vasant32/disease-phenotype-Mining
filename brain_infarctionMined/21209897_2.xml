<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neuronal calcium-activated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels of the BK type are activated by membrane depolarization and intracellular Ca(2+) ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that these channels may play a key neuroprotective role during and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, but this hypothesis has so far not been tested by selective BK-channel manipulations in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the in vivo contribution of neuronal BK channels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we performed middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice lacking BK channels (homozygous mice lacking the BK channel alpha subunit, BK(-/-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MCAO was performed in BK(-/-) and WT mice for 90 minutes followed by a 7-hour-reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronal 1 mm thick sections were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> to reveal the infarction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by MCAO produced larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, more severe neurological deficits, and higher post-ischemic mortality in BK(-/-) mice compared to WT littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly different between genotypes as measured by Laser Doppler (LD) flowmetry pre-ischemically, intra-ischemically, and post-ischemically, suggesting that the different impact of MCAO in BK(-/-) vs. WT was not due to vascular BK channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> was injected intracerebrally in non-ischemic mice, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced neurotoxicity was found to be larger in BK(-/-) mice compared to WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures revealed that BK channels contribute to rapid action potential repolarization, as previously found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When these cultures were exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-like conditions this induced significantly more neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in BK(-/-) than in WT cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that neuronal BK channels are important for protection against ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
