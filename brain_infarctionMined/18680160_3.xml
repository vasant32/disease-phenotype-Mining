<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether the KA receptors subunit GluR6 is involved in the activation of p38 MAP kinase during the transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) in the rat hippocampal CA1 subfield is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this present study, we first evaluated the time-course of phospho-p38 MAP kinase at various time-points after 15 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and then observed the effects of <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of KA receptor subunit GluR6, GluR6 antisence oligodeoxynucleotides on the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase induced by I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that inhibiting KA receptor GluR6 or suppressing the expression of KA receptor GluR6 could down-regulate the elevation of phospho-p38 MAP kinase induced by I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These drugs also reduced the phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK3/MKK6, MKK4, and MAPKAPK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our results indicated administration of three drugs, including p38 MAP kinase inhibitor before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells detected at 3 days of reperfusion and increased the number of the surviving CA1 pyramidal cells at 5 days of reperfusion after 15 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we suggest that GluR6-contained KA receptors can mediate p38 MAP kinase activation through a kinase cascade, including MLK3, MKK3/MKK6, and MKK4 and then induce increased phosphorylation of MAPKAPK-2 during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> injury and ultimately result in neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the rat hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
