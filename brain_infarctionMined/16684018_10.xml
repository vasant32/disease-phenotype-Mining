<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A large Finnish family was clinically evaluated (ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed linkage analysis with markers flanking the SCN5A gene and subsequently sequenced the SCN5A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five family members had atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e>, and due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> needed a pacemaker when adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was seen in one individual and three individuals had a slightly enlarged right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in one subject during the study, and two other members had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis favored the role of the SCN5A gene in disease pathogenesis, and direct sequencing disclosed D1275N mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This alteration was present not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six affected individuals, but also in two young individuals lacking clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defect</z:e> and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a large Finnish family appear to result from the SCN5A D1275N mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> was recorded in the family, at least three affected members had encountered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> at the age of 30 or younger </plain></SENT>
