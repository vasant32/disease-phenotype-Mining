<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prospectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> proved the most common and potent precursor of ABI's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its contribution was direct and could not be attributed to factors related both to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic, causal "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>" was associated with a risk of ABI about four times that of normotensives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of occurrence of an ABI was predicted no better with both blood pressure measurements or the mean arterial pressure than with systolic alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since there was no diminishing impact of systolic pressure with advancing age, the concept that systolic elevations are, even in the aged, innocuous is premature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing normotensives and hypertensives in each sex, women did not tolerate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> better than men </plain></SENT>
