<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:  <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> are common in patients with β-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia intermedia</z:e> (TI), especially in the splenectomized adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although arterial involvement is not commonly reported, we have recently observed a high prevalence (60%) of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on brain MRI in 30 splenectomized adults with TI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of these white matter lesions remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective work, we evaluated magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans of the same cohort of 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected were the presence or absence of vascular lesions, their locations, and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between MRA abnormality and patients/disease characteristics were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between MRA and previous MRI findings were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 29 evaluable patients, 8 (27.6%) had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of lesions had mild narrowing and mostly involved the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients (17.2%) had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and high non-transferrin-bound iron levels independently characterized patients with evidence of stenosis on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 18 patients with silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on MRI, three had evidence of stenosis on MRA with only one patient having lesions that could explain the silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral vasculopathy is common in splenectomized adults with TI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, large-vessel disease does not explain the occurrence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The combined use of MRA and MRI better identifies splenectomized TI adults with neuroimaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
