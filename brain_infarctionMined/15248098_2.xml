<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 11 preterm infants with PVHI, who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Anjo Kosei Hospital from April 1985 through December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent serial cranial ultrasonography and were diagnosed as having PVHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An EEG was recorded at least once within 1 week after PVHI and then recorded at 1- to 4-week intervals until 40 weeks of postconceptional age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EEG findings were classified into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> were seen in 5 infants after PVHI, which were symmetrical in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, 3 infants died during the early neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infants who had a higher grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> showed significantly higher mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the surviving 8 infants, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> were seen in 3 predominantly in the ipsilateral side of PVHI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> to predict outcome were 0.75 and 1.0, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> give valuable information for short-term and long-term outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm infants</z:e> with PVHI </plain></SENT>
