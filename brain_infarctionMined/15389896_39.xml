<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that individual therapeutic responses vary, but methods to identify IFN-beta responsiveness have not been validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate methods to classify IFN-beta responder status using relapses and MRI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data was analyzed from 172 patients who were followed up in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of IFN-beta1a for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders using (1) the number of relapses during the 2-year trial; (2) the number of new T2 lesions after 2 years; and (3) the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhancing lesions at year 1 and year 2 on study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included 2-year change in the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>Sclerosis</z:mp> Functional Composite, and brain parenchymal fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that subgroups with high on-study relapse numbers had more disease progression, differences between responder subgroups were similar in the IFN-beta1a and placebo arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, subgroups with high numbers of new MRI lesions had significantly more disease progression only in the IFN-beta1a arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics failed to account for differential outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New MRI lesion activity during IFN-beta1a treatment correlates with poor response to IFN-beta1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI classification may facilitate rational therapeutic decisions, better clinical trial designs, and studies correlating biomarkers with therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
