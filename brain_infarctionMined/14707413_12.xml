<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: If new advances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management are to be put into practice, crucial information about their costs needs to be considered in relation to clinically pertinent variables (e.g. handicap level and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Details of costs throughout the entire period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care are essential in the political decision-making process, in order to avoid other budget-balancing approaches, which are not always satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to perform an in-depth evaluation of the direct medical cost of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care in a large cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 435 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in 12 primary-care and referral neurology departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care was prospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on postacute care was collected by research nurses' visits to the patient's or a relative's home 18-40 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We thus collected detailed information on handicap levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospitalization costs, rehabilitation, nursing care and ambulatory costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This enabled us to calculate costs over an 18-month period after the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the 12th month after discharge, the costs amounted to 17,799 euros (16,440-19,158) per patient; the initial hospitalization accounted for 42% of this cost, rehabilitation for 29% and ambulatory care for 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These costs were mostly concentrated within the first 3- to 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 46 months without recurrence, the cost of ambulatory care outweighed the cost of the first 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Handicap levels explained 43% of the variance of costs (p &lt; 0.0001) and, according to the Rankin scale divided into 3 classes (0-2, 3 and 4-5), cumulative costs over time differed considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were not discriminating variables except for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, which were significantly less costly than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By providing a fairly comprehensive figure for the details of direct costs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care over time, our study gives some clues about the economic burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care which is mostly driven by a high handicap level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggests that any early intervention aimed at reducing the handicap level will probably dramatically reduce this burden </plain></SENT>
