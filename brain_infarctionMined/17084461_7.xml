<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports document a wide variety of insertion techniques with speeds ranging from 10 microm/s to 10 m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that insertion speed has an effect on tissue trauma induced by implantation of a neural probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to monitor the neural interface during and after probe insertion, we have developed a silicon-substrate array with hydrous <z:chebi fb="12" ids="49666">iridium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> microelectrodes for potentiometric recording of extracellular pH (pH(e)), a measure of brain homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microelectrode sites were sensitive to pH in the super-Nernstian range (-85.9 mV/pH unit) and selective over other analytes including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>, Ca(2+), and Mg(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following insertion, arrays recorded either triphasic or biphasic pH(e) responses, with a greater degree of prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> for insertions at 50 microm/s than at 0.5 mm/s or 1.0 mm/s (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spatiotemporal analysis of the recordings also revealed micro-scale variability in the pH(e) response along the array, even when using the same insertion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Implants with more intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> were often associated histologically with blood along the probe tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potentiometric microsensor array has implications not only as a useful tool to measure extracellular pH, but also as a feedback tool for delivery of pharmacological agents to treat surgical brain trauma </plain></SENT>
