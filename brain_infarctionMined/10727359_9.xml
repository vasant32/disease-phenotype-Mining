<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to correlate the echostructural characteristics of carotid plaques with neurological symptoms and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: one hundred and five plaques were studied in 74 patients by colour-flow duplex ultrasound: 39 were symptomatic and 37 were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: the images were digitalised for computer-assisted image standardisation and divided in homogenous (n=67) and heterogenous (n=38) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters of the plaque image were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: global echogenicity was significantly lower in symptomatic and in CT(+)plaques (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For homogenous plaques, an echogenic cap (EC) was visualised in 8.3% of symptomatic vs. 33.9% of asymptomatic (p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>05) and in 7.7% for plaques that were CT(+)vs. 37.7% for CT(-)(p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surface disruption was visualised in 50% of symptomatic vs. 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5% of asymptomatic (p=0.002) and in 46% of CT(+)vs. 9.4% of CT(-)plaques (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For heterogenous plaques, the echolucent region was juxtaluminal in 67% of symptomatic and CT(+)plaques vs. 33% in asymptomatic and CT(-)(p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: echolucent plaques are associated with a higher neurological risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In homogenous plaques the absence of an echogenic cap and disruption of the plaque surface also correlates with symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In heterogenous plaques, juxtaluminal location of the echolucent region is an additional marker of increased risk </plain></SENT>
