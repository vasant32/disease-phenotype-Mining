<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This experiment provides a comparative, serial evaluation of neurological deficits and brain injury following middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this high-risk strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP), spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were evaluated over 28 days using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathology, and neurobehavioral testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2- and diffusion weighted-MRI was performed after 1, 10 and 28 days to measure the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Normotensive WKY rats receiving the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other SHR-SP rats receiving sham surgery were used for control comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were scored after 1, 4, 11, 18 and 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>/injury was practically identical in hypertensive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WKY rats exhibited significantly smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.05), with neurological function recovering quickly to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by day 11 in this strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits persisted longer in hypertensive rats, with function recovering to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by day 18 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits in SHR-SP rats persisted the longest, and were observed even after 28 days (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increased and prolonged neurologic dysfunction exhibited by SHR-SP compared to SHR rats, while exhibiting practically identical degrees of brain injury/infarction, reflects the increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and sensitivity of this strain and suggests a reduced SHR-SP brain plasticity following injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone rat provides an enhanced and prolonged functional deficit model that can be used to elucidate those mechanisms/novel targets critical to longitudinal neurobehavioral recovery post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
