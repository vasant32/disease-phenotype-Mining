<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Microbleeds on T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represent a hemorrhagic type of small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease causes both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied clinical background and MRI findings of the patients to clarify the correlation between microbleeds and lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This study consisted of 180 consecutive patients who underwent brain MRI using 1.5T system in our hospital for a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging as well as T1 and T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We statistically identified the factors related to the presence of microbleeds in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of lacunes and microbleeds on MRI was compared to clarify the correlation of the lesions in the patients who had both lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The overall prevalence of microbleeds was 41.1% (74 of 180 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis indicated that previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, leukoaraiosis and lacunes were significantly correlated with microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patients who have both microbleeds and lacunes, lesions are tended to locate in thalamus and basal ganglia, especially incidence of lacunes are significantly greater compared with other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six of 398 lesions (9.05%) diagnosed as lacunes with T1- and T2-weighted imaging were demonstrated as microbleeds with T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lacunes, leukoaraiosis as a hypertensive change on MRI had statistically significant correlation with the presence of microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging should be included in the imaging protocol for cerebrovascular disease, because T1- and T2-weighted imaging recognizing some of the microbleeds as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
