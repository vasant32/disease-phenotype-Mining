<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included 35 patients (mean age 59.6 +/- 7.1 years), in stable state for 5.7 +/- 2.5 years; group 2 consisted of 39 patients (mean age 58.1 +/- 8.1 years) with LS as a debut of subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE), illness duration after LS development--3.9 +/- 2.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several parameters revealed statistically significant between-group differences: "classical" lacunar syndromes, most frequently motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, were detected in 94% of group 1 patients and in 42% of group 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pareses of the extremities were marked or moderate in 57% and 3% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Foci characteristic of LS were determined by MRI/CT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients of group 1 and in 69% of the patients of group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Foci mean size (MRI, regime T1) was larger in group 1 (0.24 +/- 0.18 cm3), comparing to group 2 (0.11 +/- 0.06 cm3); foci shape was round or oval in 77% of patients in group 1 and irregular--in 51% of patients in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 1, concomitant asymptomatic leucoareosis and lacunes were detected in 37% and 20%; in group 2--in 77% and 62%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences revealed may be used in prognosis of LS further course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences may be underlied by the lesions of intracerebral arteries of different size and differend of change occurrence that, to a certain extent, relate to different hemodynamic variants of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
