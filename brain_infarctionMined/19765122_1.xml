<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But recent data regarding active treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> showed no clinical benefit suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> may not have a detrimental effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional data are needed to resolve this uncertainty and identify patients at higher risk if any </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 477 adult Caucasian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and 395 age- and sex-matched controls admitted at the same centres for nonneurological causes were recruited consecutively from 12 neurological centres in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic, carotid ultrasonography, and transcranial Doppler studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn in the morning from fasting subjects for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was measured on admission, at 10 days and at 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 477 brain infarction patients and 395 hospitalised controls the adjusted mean (+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was higher in cases (6.4+/-1.0 mmol/l) than in controls (6.0+/-1.01 mmol/l, P=0.006), with a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> across sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fully adjusted odds ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> per 1-standard deviation increase in log-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level was 1.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.37) in men and 2.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.44-3.40) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 477 brain infarction cases elevated admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were associated with poor outcomes and higher poststroke mortality after adjustment for conventional vascular risk factors and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These relationships were not modified by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in women only and with a higher 5-year mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further investigation focusing on the impact of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level in different target population is needed to optimise glycaemic management in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
