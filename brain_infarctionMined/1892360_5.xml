<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography 1 day to 4 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight had had prior intra-arterial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen magnetic resonance angiographic studies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion in the vascular distribution of magnetic resonance image-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and, in 7 children, in the same location as previously defined abnormalities on intra-arterial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One child had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intra-arterial angiogram and magnetic resonance angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 5 children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> magnetic resonance angiographic studies included 3 with presumed embolic disease, 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow patterns could be determined in 4 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Artifact presenting as filling defects in vessels was present in 10 studies, but did not interfere with interpretation of 8 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography provides a screening technique to evaluate noninvasively brain parenchyma and vasculature in children with suspected large-vessel abnormalities, allowing selection for intra-arterial angiography and serial monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> over time and during therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
