<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the implications of LP(a), we examined plasma LP(a) levels and molecular weights of <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>(a) in patients with cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean LP(a) concentrations were higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> patients with atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> than in those with brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LP(a) levels were lower in the DM cases on diet therapy alone than in those treated with insulin or oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">hypoglycemic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that LP(a) is thrombogenic and atherogenic and that insulin may modulate LP(a) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We subclassified the <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>(a) gene into four types (A to D) by polymorphisms in the 5'-flanking region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also measured plasma LP(a) concentrations and examined expression of the gene by an in vitro assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homozygotes of type C had higher LP(a) levels than those of type D, and the relative expression of type C was higher than that of type D in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, LP(a) concentrations are genetically determined, and hyper-LP(a)-nemia is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
