<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan performed 30 minutes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> failed to depict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging could not be performed because of intrathoracic wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An emergent angiogram demonstrated filling defect in the right precentral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transaxial images of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT showed hypoperfusion areas in the right frontal and left temporo-parietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT, we could clearly detect a sharply demarcated ischemic area which was later confirmed to be an infracted lesion in the follow-up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3D-SSP, thus, appears to be useful for identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction in such cases that MRI is impermissible </plain></SENT>
