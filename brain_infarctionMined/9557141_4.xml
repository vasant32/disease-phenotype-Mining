<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography ruled out extra- and intracranial large vessel disease in 36% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRA also demonstrated extra- or intracranial disease in 56% (probably symptomatic in 31, possibly symptomatic in 18, and asymptomatic in 17 patients), and provided no information in 8% of the 118 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 176 major vessels visualized by both MRA and conventional angiography, conventional angiography confirmed the presence of 9/10 extracranial and 32/40 intracranial large vessel abnormalities detected on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were two false-negative findings on MRA: occlusion of a distal branch of middle cerebral artery, and an asymptomatic posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography is a clinically useful method for screening extra- and intracranial disease in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and selecting high-yield patients for conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
