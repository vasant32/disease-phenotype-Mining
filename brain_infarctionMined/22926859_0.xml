<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Embolism from a proximal source to the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation could be a sign of embolism from the same source to the hemispheric circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in patients with monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> of presumed ischemic origin (MVL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 129 consecutive patients with MVL secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent DWI, comprehensive ophthalmologic and neurologic examination, and diagnostic evaluations for the underlying etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses explored univariate and multivariate predictors of DWI evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWI revealed concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>(s) in 31 of the 129 patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of positive DWI was higher in embolic versus nonembolic MVL (28 vs 8%, p = 0.04), in MVL characterized by permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> versus transient symptoms (33 vs 18%, p = 0.04), and in MVL associated with concurrent hemispheric symptoms versus isolated MVL (53 vs 20%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive DWI were more likely to harbor a major underlying etiology as compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DWI (odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-9.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that MVL does not always represent an isolated disease of the retina; approximately 1 of every 4 patients with MVL demonstrates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because patients with concurrent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are more likely to exhibit a cardiac or vascular source of embolism, imaging evidence of brain injury in patients with MVL may be a useful marker to guide the timing and extent of diagnostic examinations </plain></SENT>
