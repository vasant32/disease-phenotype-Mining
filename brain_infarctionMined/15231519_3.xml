<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined whether NO metabolites (NOx) and 8-iso-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F(2alpha) (IsoP) levels in vivo correlated with the severity of periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) to evaluate potential roles of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and NO in white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants (687 males and 528 females) of a health-screening examination were recruited into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma NOx and urinary IsoP levels were measured using the Griess method and ELISA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PVH was diagnosed on the basis of MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nonparametric univariate trend analyses, plasma NOx as well as aging, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and of lacunes, mean blood pressure, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> showed highly significant monotone correlation with PVH severity (P&lt;/=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the multivariate ordinal regression analysis, the plasma NOx (P=0.002) and urinary IsoP (P=0.01) levels were found to be independent factors influencing the severity of PVH together with aging (P&lt;0.001), presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.001) and lacunes (P&lt;0.001), and mean blood pressure (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and NO have a close correlation with PVH severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and NO levels were evaluated in a general population with or without mild periventricular hyperintensity under a cross-sectional study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum NOx (NO metabolites) and urinary 8-iso-PG F2alpha (a marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>) correlated with the severity of periventricular hyperintensity in a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
