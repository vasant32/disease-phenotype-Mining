<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this protection has been demonstrated in several different treatment and injury paradigms, it has not been demonstrated in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by intraparenchymal endothelin-1 injection, a model with many advantages over other models of experimental focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reproductively mature female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized and divided into placebo and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
