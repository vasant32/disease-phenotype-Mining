<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar and cerebral gray and white matter were segmented using Freesurfer version 4.5 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used linear regression analyses to model the relationship between age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white matter lesions (WMLs) and cerebellar and cerebral volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Smaller cerebellar volumes with increasing age were mainly driven by loss of white matter </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supratentorial lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and WMLs were related to smaller cerebellar volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infratentorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were related to smaller cerebellar white matter volume and total cerebral volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that determinants of cerebellar volume do not entirely overlap with those established for cerebral volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or WMLs in the cerebrum can affect cerebellar volume </plain></SENT>
