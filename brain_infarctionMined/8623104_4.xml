<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to establish the possible role of calcification of the aortic valve with or without stenosis as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Occurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, and concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were prospectively analyzed in 300 patients with echocardiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004380'>aortic valve calcification</z:hpo>, 515 patients with calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo>, and 562 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004380'>aortic valve calcification</z:hpo>, 24 patients with calcified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo>, and 27 control subjects had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using Cox proportional hazards models, we found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004380'>aortic valve calcification</z:hpo> with or without stenosis, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and any <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On multiple logistic regression analysis, we did not find any association between one of the two valve lesions and indirect possible indications of cardiogenic embolism such as territorial as opposed to small deep brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or the presence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004380'>Aortic valve calcification</z:hpo> with or without stenosis is not a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
