<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated aggregation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) to dense plaque-like deposits in the thalamus of rats subjected to transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the underlying molecular effects of MCAO on APP processing and expression profiles of Abeta degrading enzymes in the cortex adjacent to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (penumbra) and ipsilateral thalamus 2, 7 and 30 days after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enhanced beta-amyloidogenic processing of APP and altered insulin degrading enzyme and neprilysin expression were observed in the thalamus, but not the penumbral cortex, 7 and 30 days after MCAO coinciding with increased calcium levels and beta-secretase (BACE) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutively, increased BACE activity associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of BACE trafficking protein GGA3, suggesting a post-translational stabilization of BACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> leads to complex pathogenic events in the thalamus long after the initial insult </plain></SENT>
