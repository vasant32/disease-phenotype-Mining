<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Rat models of cerebrovascular diseases are used for a variety of human pathologies comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas in neuro-intensive care, Doppler ultrasonographic examination of major cerebral arteries is a common diagnostic tool, only few data exist concerning the animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied cerebral blood flow velocities in the rat by ultrasonographic triplex mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female Wistar rats underwent a large craniectomy and baseline values for blood flow velocities were obtained by 399 examinations in 52 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameters were assessed by 301 examinations in 39 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, in 26 animals, continuous measurements of blood flow velocities were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For a duration of more than 30 minutes, values in the anterior trunk, the left carotid artery and the basilar artery were obtained every 60-90 seconds with simultaneous detection of heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flow velocities in the anterior part of cerebral circulation were faster than those in the posterior part and showed higher standard deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities in arteries belonging to the anterior circulation changed in relation to carotid flow velocity and heart rate, whereas the velocity in the basilar artery showed much lower correlation to carotid flow velocity or heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Ultrasonographic triplex mode examination of cerebral vessels offers a reproducible method to study rat cerebral blood flow velocities and vessel diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In combination with monitoring of systemic hemodynamic parameters, it can provide a detailed description of the vascular response to drugs, experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
