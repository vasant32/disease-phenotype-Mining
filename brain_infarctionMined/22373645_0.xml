<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) were isolated from male Wistar rats and perfused with plasma from rats that were hyperglycemic for 5 to 6 days by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> and underwent either <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (HG MCAO) or Sham surgery (HG Sham) compared with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> perfused with physiologic saline (No plasma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myogenic responses and endothelial function were compared in untreated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (n=8/group) or with inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>; n=8), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> (FeTMPyP; n=8) or endothelin-1 (ET-1)(A) (BQ-123; n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, animals were treated in vivo before reperfusion after mild (&lt;68% cerebral blood flow (CBF) decrease) or severe (&gt;68% CBF decrease) MCAO with FeTMPyP (n=12) or vehicle (n=12) and CBF and infarction measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HG MCAO plasma increased tone in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> versus No plasma (P&lt;0.05) that was reversed by FeTMPyP, but not by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> or BQ-123 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HG Sham plasma also increased tone in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) that was reversed by BQ-123 only </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that circulating factors in plasma can affect cerebrovascular function through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> generation and ET-1 </plain></SENT>
