<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the role of cerebral small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>), including white matter lesions (WMLs) and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, in mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) is increasingly being recognized, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> have MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated whether the presence of MPS was dependent on the microstructural integrity underlying WMLs, the early loss of integrity of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing white matter (NAWM) and location of this damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 483 elderly subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects with severe loss of integrity within their WMLs had a higher risk of MPS, regardless of WML volume (fractional anisotropy odds ratios = 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same was found in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing white matter, but this association disappeared after adjustment for WMLs and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the periventricular frontal regions-of-interest was significantly lower in subjects with MPS than without, independent of WMLs and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that integrity of WMLs, especially in the frontal lobe, is associated with MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffusion tensor imaging may be of added value in investigating the underlying mechanisms of parkinsonian signs in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
