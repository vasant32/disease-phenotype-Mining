<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the role of visual neglect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right hemisphere brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> as a predictor of poor functional outcome during the first year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, we were interested in the additional value of neglect measures besides <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, hemianopia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 57 patients with a neuroradiologically verified right hemisphere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was examined within 10 days of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were followed up for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neglect was measured with the Conventional and the Behavioural subtests of the Behavioural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Inattention</z:e> Test (BITC and BITB, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictors were determined at the 10-day examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed 3, 6 and 12 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> with the Frenchay Activities Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neglect in BITB was the best single predictor, which together with high age formed the best combination of predictors for poor functional outcome at each follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>Hemiparesis</z:hpo> was also included in this prediction model at the 3-month follow-up, but hemianopia, BITC, or visuoconstructional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> showed no additional predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, neglect usually recovered soon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When neurological and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> were assessed at the same time as the outcome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> rather than neglect was the strongest correlate of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neglect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is an important predictor of poor functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Residual neglect, which could be compensated in the follow-up tests, may nevertheless restrict patients' real-life activities and hobbies </plain></SENT>
