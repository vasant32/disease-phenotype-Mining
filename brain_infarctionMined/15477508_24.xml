<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> has been ascribed to prominent frontal lobe dysfunction secondary to ischemic lesions in frontothalamic circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether small-vessel disease in fact predominantly affects the frontal lobes is not well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> (lacunes and white matter lesions [WML]) on cortical function, as reflected in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and cognitive function, in elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Multicenter, university-based study of subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Persons with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognition, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and with and without lacunes on magnetic resonance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, normalized regional metabolic activity, and neuropsychological test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major hypotheses were that volume of lacunes and WML correlate selectively with hypometabolism of prefrontal cortex and failure of executive cognitive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lacunes correlated with metabolic rates in dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLF); WML substantially reduced metabolic rates throughout cortex, most strongly so in DLF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When regional metabolic activity was normalized to whole brain activity, lacunes remained correlated with DLF activity, whereas the WML effect was no longer found, probably because of its general distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and normalized activity in DLF also correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metabolic activity in DLF correlated with executive function, memory, and global cognitive function, while activity in middle temporal gyrus correlated with memory and global function but not executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic effects of lacunes and WML are most apparent in DLF, but the effects of WML are generalized and frontal hypometabolism correlates with memory and global impairment, cognitive as well as executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effects of subcortical cerebrovascular disease appear to converge on the frontal lobes but are diffuse, complex, and of modest magnitude </plain></SENT>
