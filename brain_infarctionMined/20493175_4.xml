<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> on measures of behavior in New Zealand white rabbits embolized using a suspension of small-sized blood clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these studies, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> was administered up to 3 hours following embolization, and behavior was measured 48 hours following embolization to calculate the dose of emboli (P(50) in mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A treatment is considered neuroprotective if it significantly increases the P(50) compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment (20mg/kg, bolus subcutaneous injection) significantly improved clinical function and increased the P(50) by 143% when administered 1 hour following embolization but was ineffective at 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In combination studies with the thrombolytic, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) using a standard intravenous dose of 3.3mg/kg (20% bolus, 80% infused), we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> could be safely administered with tPA to improve clinical scores; however, the maximum behavioral improvement with the combination treatment was similar to either monotherapy alone, both of which significantly improved behavior (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> neuroprotection may be related to a variety of signaling pathways including Rho-kinase (ROCK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine if a ROCK mechanism is involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection following embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, we used pharmacological intervention with the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When fasudil was administered 30 minutes before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> (given at 1 hour), there was an additional significant (p=0.0217) synergistic increase in behavioral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, fasudil as a monotherapy did not affect behavioral function in embolized rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that there may be an interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment and the ROCK signaling pathway that should be further explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment may have clinical benefit when used alone or in the presence of tPA, but the therapeutic window using a single-dose regimen is narrow </plain></SENT>
