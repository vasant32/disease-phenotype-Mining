<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare two different functional procedures in the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338437" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurocysticercosis</z:e> (NCC): (1) electroencephalography (EEG) evaluated by brain maps and EEG current sources in the frequency domain using variable resolution electromagnetic tomography and (2) blood flow analyzed by computerized tomography assessed with stable Xe (Xe-CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with NCC at different evolution stages were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT and Xe-CT scans, as well as quantitative electroencephalography with source calculation in the frequency domain, were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> and in 6 of them there were also vascular complications: two of them presented calcifications of the middle cerebral artery, two other subjects showed calcifications of the vessels in the circle of Willis and the remaining two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> areas important hypoperfused zones were observed, as intense as those observed in infarcted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Damage to the blood-brain barrier was originated by parasites in colloidal phase (final cysticerci stage) producing large areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal delta EEG activity was observed in very large lesions, probably generated by partial cortical deafferentation; and abnormal theta activity was mainly related to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> activity were very similar in topography to the hypoperfused areas </plain></SENT>
