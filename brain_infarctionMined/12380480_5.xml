<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients (11 with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> and 14 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of middle cerebral arterial territories) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rMSD values were measured from 83 regions of interest and compared with measurements from corresponding rCBV and rCBF maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, rMSD correlated strongly with rCBF (r = 0.96) but only fairly with rCBV (r = 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absence of an association between rMSD and rCBV was evident in regions of increased contrast bolus dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> patients, the correlation of rMSD with rCBF (r = 0.85) was similar to that of rMSD with rCBV (r = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interparameter associations were well predicted by computer simulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that rMSD is as useful as rCBF under a variety of pathophysiological conditions, whereas in conditions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean transit time, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, rMSD provides equivalent blood volume information to rCBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simplicity of rMSD maps could lead to the increased use of perfusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
