<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It possesses <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties, the ability of neurotransmitter/receptor modulation and antiplatelet activation factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This research is designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of long-term treatment with EGb761 (a standard form of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf) in combination with MgSO(4), FK506, or MK-801 on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of male gerbils' brain induced by unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five gerbils fed a standard diet were intragastrically given water or EGb761 (100 mg/kg/day) for one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five randomized groups were established: control (n = 7), EGb761 (n = 8), EGb761 + MgSO(4) (n = 7), EGb761 + FK506 (n = 7), and EGb761 + MK-801 (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three drug-combination groups were injected with MgSO(4) (90 mg/kg), FK506 (0.5 mg/kg), or MK-801 (1 mg/kg), respectively 30 min before MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were anesthetized and craniectomized to expose the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was constricted with an 8-0 suture to produce a permanent ligation for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postmortem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were determined by quantitative image analysis of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC)-stained brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes of the four treated groups either EGb761 alone or in combination with drugs were lower than the control group by 36.1% (EGb761 alone), 40.3% (EGb761 + MgSO(4)), 35.3% (EGb761 + FK506), and 56.4% (EGb761 + MK-801), respectively (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main affected areas of the brain in the four treated groups were significantly focused between 4 and 6 mm from the frontal pole, when compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals in the five groups had infarctions in both cortex and subcortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that long-term pre-treatment of EGb761 administered either alone or in combination with drugs significantly effective neuroprotection on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in gerbil ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
