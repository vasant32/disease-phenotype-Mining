<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> affecting the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to antibiotic therapy remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is an even greater challenge in patients who have underlying compromise of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors present a 46-year-old male with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who was found to have cerebrospinal fluid compatible with syphilitic involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and a cerebral arteriogram, which revealed focal narrowing of the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline transcranial Doppler study demonstrated increased mean and peak flow velocity within the right middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite a 10-day course of intravenous <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi>, with substantial improvement in the cerebrospinal fluid results, this flow velocity elevation persisted, in a remarkably consistent pattern, over a 4-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the involved vessel remained patent following treatment, but no clear resolution of the stenotic lesion was observed </plain></SENT>
