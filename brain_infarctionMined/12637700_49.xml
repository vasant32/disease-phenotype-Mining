<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>Pneumonia</z:hpo> has been estimated to occur in about one third of patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only limited data are available on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (SAP) in specialized neurological intensive care units (NICUs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 124 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were treated at our university hospital NICU in a prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates and risk factors of SAP and long-term clinical outcome were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAP incidence was 21% with a spectrum of pathogens, which is comparable to previously published data on general ICU patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanical ventilation, multiple location, and vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and abnormal chest x-ray findings, were identified as risk factors for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAP patients showed higher mortality rates than nondiseased subjects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, 26.9% versus 8.2%; long-term, 35.3% versus 14.3%) and a significantly poorer long-term clinical outcome (Barthel Index, 50.5+/-42.4 versus 81.5+/-27.8; Rankin Scale, 3.5+/-1.7 versus 2.2+/-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data underline the considerable epidemiological and prognostic impact of SAP for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in a specialized NICU setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They demonstrate that the occurrence of SAP deteriorates clinical outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results allow us to identify high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients at time of NICU admission in whom the use of preventive treatment strategies is most promising </plain></SENT>
