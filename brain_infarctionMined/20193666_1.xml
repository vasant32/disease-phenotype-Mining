<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteomic profiling using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated upregulation of albumin protein after 2h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 22h of reperfusion among the other altered proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, the albumin overexpression was verified by quantitative real time PCR at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, validated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although, exogenous human albumin therapy is already under clinical trials for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, its endogenous expression in ischemic rat brain at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels has not been investigated as yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report for the first time de novo synthesis of albumin in the ischemic rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study paves the way for further investigation of signaling mechanisms leading to albumin overexpression, so that it can be exploited as a therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
