<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It hypothesized that prolonged oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6715">medroxyprogesterone</z:chebi> (MPA) plus oral conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> (CEE) diminishes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> ability to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> damage in the rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis, we fed ovariectomized rats CEE or MPA, or a combination of CEE and MPA (CEP), before inducing 120 min of reversible focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, using the intraluminal filament model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 22 h reperfusion, the brains were harvested and infarction volumes were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CEE alone or with CEP reduced cortical infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, CEP failed to provide ischemic protection in subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that CEE alone, or with CEP, is neuroprotective in the cortex, but interactive effects between the hormones may counteract CEE beneficial effects in subcortical brain regions </plain></SENT>
