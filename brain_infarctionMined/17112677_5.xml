<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thoroughly investigated the expression of astrocytic connexin 43 (Cx43) after photothrombosis in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The temporal profile of Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as well as protein expression was studied in remote, structurally uninjured cortical and hippocampal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal formation revealed an increased number of Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positive astrocytes and an up-regulated protein expression exclusively in the ipsilateral stratum oriens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assume a participation of this region in glia scar formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positive cells were transiently increased, immunoreactivity was reduced in the somatosensory cortex of injured hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed decrease of Cx43 protein in the post-ischemic cerebral cortex implies an impairment of gap junctional intercellular communication which might be detrimental to the brain </plain></SENT>
