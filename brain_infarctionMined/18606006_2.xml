<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) in mice results in a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the volume of which depends on the length of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following permanent occlusion, neuropathological changes - including a robust glial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> - also occur downstream of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have performed short, transient MCAo in mice to induce penumbral damage spanning the motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 30 minute MCAo using a poly-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi>-coated intraluminal suture introduced through a common carotid artery incision was performed in 17 female C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five sham-operated mice received common carotid artery ligation without insertion of the suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioural assessments were performed during occlusion, immediately following reperfusion, and at 24 and 72 hours post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Routine histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed at 24 and 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 11 of the surviving 16 mice subjected to MCAo, we observed a focal, subcortical necrotic lesion and a reproducible, diffuse cortical lesion with accompanying upper motor neuron involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was associated with contralateral ventral spinal cord microglial priming without significant reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> or lower <z:mp ids='MP_0000938'>motor neuron degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The advantages to this method are that it yields a reproducible cortical lesion, the extent of which is predictable using behavioural testing during the period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with upper motor neuron involvement and downstream priming, but not full activation, of microglia in the lumbar spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, survival is excellent following the 30 minutes of occlusion, rendering this a novel and useful model for examining the effects of microglial priming in the spinal motor neuron pool </plain></SENT>
