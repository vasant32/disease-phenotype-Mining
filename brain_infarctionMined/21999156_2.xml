<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kuwaiti <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> patients carry the India/Arab chromosomal haplotype, which is associated with elevated Hb F (on average ~22%) on account of the Xmn1 site in the (G)γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients had either Hb SS or Hb S-β(0)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> (β(0)-thal) and there are a few <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hb SD</z:e> compound heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have carried out longitudinal clinical studies of these patients to document the pattern of morbidity, spleen function, brain and hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prevalence of silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> of the femoral head (AVNFH), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, pulmonary function, SPECT (single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography) brain cerebral blood flow and response of selected patients to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) treatment were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Hb SS and Hb S-β-thal patients have a generally mild phenotype compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> in other populations and most patients do not have their first pain crisis until about the age of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spleen function is retained till late childhood; pneumococcemia and other severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are uncommon in childhood (~3% prevalence) although SPECT reveals cerebral blood flow deficits in ~30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>Avascular necrosis</z:hpo> of the femoral head is, however, common with a prevalence of ~26% in children and 50% in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is brisk response to HU in patients with frequent pain crises, with marked increases in Hb F levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who are compound heterozygotes for Hbs S and D-Los Angeles, have the most severe phenotype despite Hb F levels of &gt;20% and Hb S &lt;30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although the patients have a uniformly elevated Hb F level, there are still considerable phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and other modulating genetic factors that require further studies </plain></SENT>
