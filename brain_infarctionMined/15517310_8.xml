<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, the age of the lesion was determined by measuring the time elapsed between initial clinical presentation and date of surgery or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple microscopic variables were analyzed on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 104 (76%) male and 33 (24%) female patients with a median age of 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The location of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> included 129 cerebral, 5 cerebellar, and 1 each in the pons, midbrain and medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age of the lesions ranged from 1 day to 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were single and varied from lacunes to large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the distribution of one or more cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Key histologic features of the proposed classification are as follows: (1) phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury (11 cases studied), age 1-2 days, characterized by the presence of neuronal changes, and spongiosis of the neuropil and absence of neuronal ferrugination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, macrophages, neo-vascularization and cavitation; (2) phase of organization subdivided into: (a) phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (31 cases), age 3-37 days, characterized by coagulative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and (b) phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (57 cases), age 10 days-53 years, characterized by the presence or absence of coagulative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, neuronal injury, red neurons, macrophages, mononuclear inflammatory cells, perivascular cuffing, cavitation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, spheroids; absence of neutrophils; and (3) phase of resorption (38 cases), age 26 days-23 years, characterized by absence of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
