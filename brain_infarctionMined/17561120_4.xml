<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurons around <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> ischemic foci exhibited an enhanced immunoreactivity for 14-3-3 proteins either in the cytoplasm (especially for its sigma isoform) or in the nucleus (especially for its beta isoform), and sometimes in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>14-3-3-like immunoreactivity was evaluated in each neuron, which enabled us to identify into three patterns: intense cytoplasmic staining with or without nuclear staining; a predominant nuclear staining with weak cytoplasmic staining; and an exclusive nuclear staining without cytoplamic staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantification of 1500 neurons in relation to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> estimated by the relative distance from ischemic foci clarified that nuclear immunoreactivity for 14-3-3 proteins was more frequent in neurons near the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the cytoplasm of astrocytes was similarly positive for the sigma and the epsilon isoform, their nuclei were only immunopositive for the gamma isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral white matter with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, axonal swelling and some nuclei of oligodendrocytes were positive for the zeta isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isoform-specific translocation of 14-3-3 proteins into nuclei is a cellular reaction to ischemic stress that may be related to survival of neurons and their protection against cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
