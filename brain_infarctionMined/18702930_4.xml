<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the lesion, each of the 244 cases presented at least one of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e>, Fourth Edition (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV) symptoms of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349208" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">manic episode</z:e>, namely, elated or irritable mood, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233681" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">grandiosity</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0859023" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">talkativeness</z:e>, flight of ideas, hyperhedonism, reduced need for sleep, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, or distractibility (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> optional in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As expected, the subgroup of 59 manic patients had a right hemisphere lesion far more often than a left one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, this was also true of various sets of the nonmanic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, elation was not the symptom most strongly associated with lesion side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elation without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100754'>mania</z:hpo> was not significantly predicted by lesion side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0859023" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">talkativeness</z:e> was strongly predicted by right lesion side whether in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0564408,C0338831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">manic</z:e> or nonmanic patients or even when the symptom was the only symptom observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo> was consistently and robustly associated with right lesion side, but not completely distinctly so (it fell short of significance when not accompanied by elation or other symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that prevalence of right hemisphere lesions causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100754'>mania</z:hpo> is primarily related to mental and behavioral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> rather than a shift of mood and that it consists of release of left hemisphere influence </plain></SENT>
