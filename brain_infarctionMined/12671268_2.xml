<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hand use, however, critically depends on visual guidance in such patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using regional cerebral blood flow measurements, we wished to identify interrelated brain areas that are engaged in relation to manual activity in seven patients after their first hemiparetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the blind-folded performance of sequential finger movements, the patients differed significantly from healthy controls (n = 7) by the recruitment of a predominantly contralesional network involving visual cortical areas, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Greater expression of this cortical-subcortical network correlated with a more severe sensorimotor deficit in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reflecting its role for post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients also differed from controls on a lesion-related pattern expressed during rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A third differentiating pattern involved the ipsilesional supplementary motor area and the contralesional premotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recovery form impaired sensorimotor integration utilizes crossmodal plasticity of a visual network </plain></SENT>
