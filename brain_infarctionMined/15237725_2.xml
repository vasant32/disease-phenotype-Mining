<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging(DWI) and T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images showed cortical and thalamic hyperintensity with swelling of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions did not respect vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also observed an increased signal in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery on magnetic resonance angiography(MRA), and leptomeningeal enhancement on postcontrast MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging revealed that the abnormal findings resolved within a few weeks, although a residual area of increased T2 signal intensity persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the presence of reversible cytotoxic and vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this disorder should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of other conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
