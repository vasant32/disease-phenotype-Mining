<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The previously reported method for quantitative measurements of whole-brain or hemispheric-brain perfusion using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) radionuclide angiography is now further developed so that regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) can be measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lassen's correction algorithm is used for the linearization of a curve-linear relationship between the radioactivity in the brain and blood flow as seen with single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPET) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this algorithm, the cerebral hemisphere was chosen as the reference region and the correction factor alpha was adapted to rCBF in the reference region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This new method of measuring CBF from SPET has been validated in 33 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 22 patients with cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF values in 20 brain regions of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were in good agreement with reported values measured by other methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF in the frontal cortex was greater than that in the temporal, parietal or occipital cortex for the entire age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This hyperfrontal perfusion tended to be less pronounced with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> showed significantly lower rCBF than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core showed a low rCBF value of 11.1 ml/100 g/min on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase in rCBF after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration was observed and measured with this method in five patients with unilateral occlusive vascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this non-invasive method (without any blood sampling) permits the routine measurement of rCBF from HMPAO SPET tomograms of blood flow </plain></SENT>
