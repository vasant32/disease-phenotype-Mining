<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, attempts to recanalize the brain are currently being extended beyond the classic 3-h time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanical thrombectomy is particularly attractive as it may carry lesser risks of severe hemorrhagic transformation than thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether late reperfusion per se promotes hemorrhagic transformation and increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume as compared to permanent occlusion is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is no study of the histopathologic sequelae of late reperfusion following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (MCAo) in the non-human primate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five young adult baboons completed a specially designed protocol of 20-h MCAo (under etomidate anaesthesia), followed by 4-week survival and finally perfusion-fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured histologically using validated stereological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to our previously published series of 6 h and permanent MCAo performed with identical experimental and post mortem procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was present in each baboon, consistently involving the caudate head, internal capsule and putamen; the adjacent inferior frontal cortex was involved in one subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly larger than with 6 h MCAo, as expected, but did not differ from permanent MCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> around the infarcted area in any animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that following a 20 h ischemic episode, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was similar to that found with permanent occlusion, with no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cautiously extrapolating to the human situation, our findings suggest that even late mechanical recanalization may not promote brain damage and could be considered in selected cases </plain></SENT>
