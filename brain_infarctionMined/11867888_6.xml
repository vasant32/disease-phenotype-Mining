<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In France, the socioeconomic aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have never been addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such analyses are essential for health authorities to justify the establishment of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units when resources are low, provided it can be shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units are effective in reducing both the morbidity and mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 6 dedicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> services exist for 60 million inhabitants in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and postacute pathways and to determine the factors that influence destination after discharge, handicap evolution and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cohort of 494 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, we collected information on medical and socioeconomic variables, handicap and its evolution using the modified Rankin scale and Mini-Mental Status score at the 10th day, 6th month and 18th-40th month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data were recorded during the initial hospital stay, at the follow-up clinic visit and in a home interview done 18-40 months after discharge by research nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used multiple logistic regression for analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most important factor for not returning home was having a Rankin score greater than 3 with an odds ratio of 41.7 (95% confidence interval 19.2-90.0; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that when the Rankin score was 0, 1 or 2, the main factors for not returning home were socioeconomic variables and serious medical disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the Rankin score was 4 or 5, the main reason for not being sent for rehabilitation was medical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for the Rankin score, patients who returned home or were transferred to rehabilitation were quite similar regarding socioeconomic and medical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other patients transferred to a geriatric ward, nursing home or new housing were more frequently living alone, 60 years of age or older, had less than 2 children, low level of education, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, the mean cost was 19,513 Euros over an 18-month period and was mainly driven by the level of the Rankin score (e.g. 10,530 vs. 34,809 Euros for Rankin scores of 0-1 and 4-5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data showed that not only handicap level but also socioeconomic variables are important in determining the destination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They may help health authorities to make decisions to establish new approaches to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study can also serve as a basis for future cost-effectiveness studies of new drugs being evaluated in therapeutic trials or of new management strategies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
