<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on seven patients with a clinical manifestation of sensory-motor deficit, imitating peripheral nerve involvement, due to lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> verified by brain computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients had an ulnar nerve-like deficit and two median nerve-like deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were located in the thalamus and the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No clinical or electrophysiological evidence for peripheral nerve involvement was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unusual peripheral nerve pattern of lesions caused by lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be defined as an additional lacunar syndrome and must be taken into consideration in the clinical evaluation of peripheral nerve deficits with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nerve conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
