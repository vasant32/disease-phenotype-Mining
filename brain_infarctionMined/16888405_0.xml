<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated the presence of activated areas in the non-injured contralateral sensorimotor cortex in addition to the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex of the area surrounding a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, using a rat model of focal photochemically induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e>) and functional magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this model, we next applied gene expression profiling to screen key molecules upregulated in the activated area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from the ipsilateral and contralateral sensorimotor cortex to the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and from the sham controlled cortex, and hybridized to gene-expression profiling arrays containing 1,322 neurology-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that glycine receptors were upregulated in both the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex to the focal ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To prove the preclinical significance of upregulated glycine receptors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18344">kynurenic acid</z:chebi>, an endogenous <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> to glycine receptors on neuronal cells, was administered intrathecally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18344">kynurenic acid</z:chebi> significantly improved behavioral recovery within 10 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> induced by the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e> (p &lt; 0.0001), as evaluated with beam walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intrathecal administration of a glycine receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> may facilitate behavioral recovery during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
