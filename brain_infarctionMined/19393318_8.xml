<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured an increased number of extravascular NE-positive cells, as well as increased levels of tissue elastase protein and activity, following transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both pharmacologic inhibition of NE with ZN200355 (ZN), and genetic deletion of NE, significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, blood-brain barrier disruption, vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and leukocyte-endothelial adherence 24 h after tMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ZN also reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in MMP9-null mice following tMCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were, however, no reductions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume or vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in NE-null mice in two models of permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirm the involvement of NE in neurovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathology, when reperfusion allows neutrophils access to vulnerable brain, with pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of NE being both neuro- and vasculo-protective in this setting </plain></SENT>
