<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1 h followed by reperfusion for 23 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received an intravenous bolus injection of Forsythoside B at 15 min after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that Forsythoside B at doses higher than 8 mg/kg produced a significant neuroprotective potential in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forsythoside B (20 mg/kg) demonstrated significant neuroprotective activity even after delayed administration at 1 h, 3 h and 5 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forsythoside B 20 mg/kg attenuated histopathological damage as demonstrated by smaller brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, decreased cerebral Evans blue extravasation and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, inhibited cerebral <z:chebi fb="27" ids="28659">phosphor</z:chebi>-IkappaB-alpha and nuclear transcription factors kappaB (NF-kappaB) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, NF-kappaB expression with immunohistochemical staining was reduced, while circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these findings suggested that Forsythoside B exerted potent neuroprotective effects with a favorable therapeutic time-window, reduce of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury degree, attenuating blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown, and its protective effects may be due to inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
