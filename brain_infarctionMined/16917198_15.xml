<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both studies involve more than 1000 older persons who agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Published findings from the studies to date suggest that the relationship between risk factors, pathology, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some cases, known neuropathologic indices mediate the association of risk factors to cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In other cases, risk factors modify the relation of pathology to cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, some risk factors seem to be related to clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, even decline in episodic memory, in the absence of any association with amyloid plaques, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, or other pathologic indices that can be identified and quantified at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings to date illustrate the kinds of insights that can be gained into mechanisms of disease through the incorporation of pathologic indices into well-designed, epidemiologic studies of aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
