<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> LI, who presented a lacunar syndrome according to Miller-Fisher's classification were recruited and were classified into a group presenting isolated LI on MRI (n = 17) or multiple LI (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite equivalent demographic, clinical and cognitive characteristics, patients with multiple LI had increased ratings of WMH in frontal, occipital and subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations could be evidenced between the number of LI and WMH ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Present findings provide support to previous hypothesis considering single and multiple LI MRI presentations of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients as distinct entities </plain></SENT>
