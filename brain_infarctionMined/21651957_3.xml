<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study sought to determine the neuroprotective effect of anthocyanin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27843">cyanidin</z:chebi>-3-O-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15903">glucoside</z:chebi> (CG), isolated and purified from tart cherries, against permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) in mice and its potential mechanisms of neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C57BL/6 mice subjected to pMCAO were treated with CG orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after pMCAO, neurological scoring was used to evaluate functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains were then excised for measuring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and brain <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a separate set of experiments, the influence of CG on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor (AIF) release from mitochondria under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> were assessed in isolated cortical neurons from adult mouse brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction volume was attenuated by 27% in mice pre-treated with 2mg/kg of CG compared to vehicle-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed treatment with 2mg/kg of CG also showed 25% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological functional outcome was significantly improved in mice pre- or post-treated with CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to vehicle treated mice CG treated mice had lower levels of brain <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CG also blocked the release of AIF from mitochondria under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, but did not inhibit the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data show that CG is neuroprotective against pMCAO in mice, and this beneficial effect may be mediated by attenuation of brain <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> levels after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CG may also exert its neuroprotective effect by blocking AIF release in mitochondria </plain></SENT>
