<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> occurred relatively more often during the first 30 minutes after awakening than at any other time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In multiple stepwise logistic regression analyses, snoring was the only independent risk factor differentiating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring during sleep and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring either during sleep or during the first 30 minutes after awakening from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring at other times of the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk ratios were 2.65 (95% confidence interval 1.32-5.29, p less than 0.005) and 3.16 (95% confidence interval 1.61-6.22, p less than 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other factors tested were age, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> seemed to have an additive effect on the independent risk caused by snoring </plain></SENT>
