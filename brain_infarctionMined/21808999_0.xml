<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS) for a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012020'>right-sided aortic arch</z:hpo> with an aberrant left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 72-year-old man presented right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neck CT angiography showed 70% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> as artery-to-artery embolism due to ICA stenosis and decided to perform carotid artery stenting (CAS) for symptomatic ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT angiography to evaluate an access route to the lesion incidentally showed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012020'>right-sided aortic arch</z:hpo> with an aberrant left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An intraoperative aortogram showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012020'>right-sided aortic arch</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The guiding catheter was carefully introduced up to the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CAS was performed with a proximal balloon and distal filter protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The stenotic area was restored, and the patient was discharged without suffering recurrent attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012020'>right-sided aortic arch</z:hpo> with an aberrant left subclavian artery is a very rare anatomical variation, it can be encountered in neuroendovascular treatment, and therefore knowledge of this anatomical variation is important </plain></SENT>
