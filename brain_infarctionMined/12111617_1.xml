<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve centers in 10 Italian regions were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and instrumental data were prospectively collected for 335 patients 65 years or older, presenting in a 12-months period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with the presence of total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and the use of antiedema agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-related disability was related to female sex, unified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">USS</z:e>) scores at entry and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores at the 1-months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (70%) received antiplatelets to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
