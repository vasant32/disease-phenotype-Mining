<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was made in mature male rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>dFGF was administered by intracisternal injection at one and three days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests to evaluate sensorimotor recovery of the contralateral limbs were done during the next three weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: dFGF significantly enhanced recovery of sensorimotor function in limb placing and body swing tests compared to vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in body weight or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in dFGF- vs. vehicle-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: dFGF represents a potential treatment to enhance functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and offers several advantages over bFGF, including stability and independence from extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26820,35175">sulfates</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
