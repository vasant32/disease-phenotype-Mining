<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that administration of brazilein after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reperfusion can reduce the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> area and improve the neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the action were investigated and attributed to the anti-inflammatory effect of brazilein, because a decrease of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) was found in the ischemic animals with brazilein treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further substantiate the anti-inflammatory effect of brazilein, we examined the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the cytokines in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) induced microglial cell line BV2 cells; TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expressions were significantly suppressed by brazilein treatment but the decrease of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) produced by inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), another indicator of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> of the immune cells was measured in RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV2 cells; brazilein inhibited its production induced by LPS in both types of cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of iNOS was also decreased by brazilein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these results illustrate that brazilein can protect the brain against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury and the anti-inflammatory effect was believed to be one of the contributive mechanisms </plain></SENT>
