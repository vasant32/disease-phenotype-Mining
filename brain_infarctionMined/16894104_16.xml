<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Cardiovascular Health Study is a population-based, longitudinal study of people aged 65 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was measured annually using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) and the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors tested whether education level modified 1) the cross-sectional association between cognitive performance and MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 2) the change in cognitive function associated with an incident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at a follow-up MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In cross-sectional analysis (n = 3,660), MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was associated with a greater impact on 3MS performance in the lowest education quartile when compared with others (p for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among those with a follow-up MRI who had no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on initial MRI (n = 1,433), education level was not associated with the incidence, size, or location of new brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a new MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> predicted substantially greater decline in 3MS scores in the lowest education group compared with the others (6.3, 95% CI 4.4- to 8.2-point decline vs 1.7, 95% CI 0.7- to 2.7-point decline; p for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher education was not associated with smaller declines in DSST performance in the setting of MRI-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Education seems to modify an individual's decline on a test of general cognitive function when there is incident brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive reserve influences the impact of vascular injury in the brain </plain></SENT>
