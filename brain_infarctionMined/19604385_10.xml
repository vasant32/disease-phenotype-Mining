<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The widespread use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA-approved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment, remains limited by its narrow therapeutic time window and related risks of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normobaric oxygen therapy (NBO) may be a useful physiological strategy that slows down the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, thus potentially allowing for delayed or more effective thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the effects of NBO started simultaneously with intravenous tPA, in spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After homologous clot injection, animals were randomized into different treatment groups: saline injected at 1 hour; tPA at 1 hour; saline at 1 hour plus NBO; tPA at 1 hour plus NBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NBO was maintained for 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and hemorrhagic transformation were quantified at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome assessments were blinded to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Upon clot injection, cerebral perfusion in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory dropped below 20% of pre-ischemic baselines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both tPA-treated groups showed effective thrombolysis (perfusion restored to nearly 100%) and smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (379 +/- 57 mm3 saline controls; 309 +/- 58 mm3 NBO; 201 +/- 78 mm3 tPA; 138 +/- 30 mm3 tPA plus NBO), showing that tPA-induced reperfusion salvages ischemic tissue and that NBO does not significantly alter this neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NBO had no significant effect on hemorrhagic conversion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBO can be safely co-administered with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of tPA thrombolysis is not affected and there is no induction of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These experimental results require clinical confirmation </plain></SENT>
