<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Walther possesses several biological/pharmacological activities including hepatoprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Water (GWE), 50% alcohol (GE50) extracts of Graptopetalum paraguayense E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Walther, and extracts obtained from further extraction of GE50 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27750">ethyl acetate</z:chebi> (GEE) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of GEE, but not GWE or GE50, for 2 weeks protected animals against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of GEE was accompanied by reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, neurological deficits, caspase-3 activity, malondialdehyde content, microglia activation, and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since microglia-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> plays critical roles in ischemic brain injury, anti-inflammatory potential of Graptopetalum paraguayense E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Walther leaf extracts was further investigated on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma-activated BV-2 microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GEE decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>- and LPS/IFN-gamma-induced free radical generation and LPS/IFN-gamma-induced iNOS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic study revealed that the neuroactive effects of GEE were markedly associated with anti-oxidative potential, activation of serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases, and down-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, Akt, Src, Janus kinase-1, Tyk2, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, and NF-kappaB and might be attributed to the presence of polyphenolic compounds such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30778">gallic acid</z:chebi>, genistin, daidzin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings point out its potential therapeutic strategies that target microglia activation, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and iNOS expression to reduce ischemic brain injury and suggest that Graptopetalum paraguayense E </plain></SENT>
