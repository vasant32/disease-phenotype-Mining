<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine parenchymal effects of tPA and its non-protease mutant S478A-tPA in permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, before doing in vivo experiments, effects of tPA and S478A-tPA on zinc or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> toxicity were first studied in cortical cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like tPA, which has protease-independent cytoprotective effects, the non-protease mutant S478A-tPA blocked zinc toxicity in cortical cell cultures, but did not affect calcium-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, effects of tPA and S478A-tPA on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> induced by permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>tPA and S478A-tPA were administered into the cerebral ventricle 15 min or 1 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both tPA and its non-protease mutant S478A-tPA, when given 15 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, substantially reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and ameliorated motor deficits in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when administered 1 h after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, neither showed protective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protective effects of tPA or S478A-tPA remained unchanged at 7 days after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indicating that the native protein conformation is necessary for the protective effect of tPA and S478A-tPA, heat-denatured tPA did not exhibit any protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since S478A-tPA lacks protease activity, which has been implicated in causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or aggravating excitotoxicity, its parenchymal neuroprotective effect may be useful in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
