<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cerebrovascular lesions were compared separately in 40 brains of patients with mild and 50 with severe AD features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the two groups, the number of lesions were compared between the brains with severe and those with mild of absent CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of the patients, the vascular risk factors and antithrombotic treatment were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the compared groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brains with mild and severe AD features and with CAA contained more haematomas, cortical micro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and micro-bleeds, and more severe white matter changes, and cortico-subcortical and white matter mini-bleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the CAA brains with severe AD features, also more cortical territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed, compared to those with mild AD features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increase in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> cannot be attributed to the CAA alone, but also to the severity of the degenerative features, implying additional vascular factors in the pathogenesis of AD </plain></SENT>
