<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Once the user determines the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> boundary by visual inspection, the methods compute the area within the boundary with the assumption that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the spots within the boundary have been infarcted at the same level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in the same brain image, partially infarcted spots often tend to appear pinkish whereas fully or severely infarcted spots appear white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a program called InfarctSizer, which automatically detects the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region and computes the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume proportional to infarction levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of InfarctSizer with other methods shows that InfarctSizer computes the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume more accurately and efficiently than other methods </plain></SENT>
