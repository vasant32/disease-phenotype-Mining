<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RIPoC performed in the hind limb reduces brain injury following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether RIPoC has a neuroprotective effect with respect to global cerebral I/R injury is, however, unknown, and the mechanism of neuroprotection needs further elucidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether RIPoC could reduce global cerebral I/R injury in rats and whether this neuroprotective effect was induced by up-regulating endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was performed via 8min of four-vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal density, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in the hippocampal CA1 region were assessed after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task was used to quantify spatial learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS (Ser1177), Akt and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) in the CA1 region was measured after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RIPoC significantly attenuated delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and reduced the spatial learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> associated with global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pre-administration of LY294002 (a highly selective inhibitor of PI3K) not only significantly reversed the neuroprotective effect of RIPoC, but also obviously inhibited the up-regulation of eNOS induced by RIPoC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that RIPoC protects the brain against global cerebral I/R injury and that this neuroprotection is mediated by up-regulating eNOS through the PI3K/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
