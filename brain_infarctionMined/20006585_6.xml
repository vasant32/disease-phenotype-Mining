<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, studies were carried out to determine which kinds of plasma proteins are conjugated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> was mainly conjugated with albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that Lys-557 and Lys-560, located at the surface of domain III of albumin, were the major sites conjugated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to identify the amino acid residues in a protein modified by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that conjugation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> with albumin contributed to a decrease in the toxicity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
