<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery in two sets of rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first set was used to monitor NO concentration and cathepsin activity, while the second was used for histological examination with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, and TUNEL staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A group in both set was administered human recombinant erythropoietin (HrEPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NO content, cathepsins B and L activity increased significantly in the post-ischemic cerebral tissue (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HrEPO treatment reduced NO concentration and cathepsin activity to control level (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the number of necrotic and apoptotic neurons was observed in the post-ischemic cerebral cortex (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HrEPO treatment was markedly lowered both of these (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that HrEPO prevents neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by protecting neuronal liposomes from NO-mediated toxicity and suppressing the release of cathepsins </plain></SENT>
