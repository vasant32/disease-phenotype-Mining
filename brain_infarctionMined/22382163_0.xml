<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether covert symptoms are associated with subclinical brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBIs) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association between covert <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms and SBI/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in persons with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1881 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) participants free of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (40% male, 50% black, 47-70 years) were queried for covert symptoms and underwent cerebral MRI during the baseline MRI visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were reassessed after 3 years at Visit 4 (n=1001; 39% male, 50% black) and approximately 10 years with a follow-up MRI (n=1006; 40% male, 50% black, 61-83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Covert symptoms were associated with prevalent SBI (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.21-3.11; P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No support was found for associations between baseline MRI symptoms and SBI at the follow up MRI visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In participants without SBI at baseline, symptoms at Visit 4 (OR, 2.96; 1.23-7.13; P=0.016) and symptoms at the follow-up MRI visit (OR, 4.29; 2.51-7.33; P&lt;0.001) were associated with a combined outcome of new SBI/clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on follow-up MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Covert symptoms at follow-up MRI visit were also associated with having new SBI (OR, 2.26; 1.18-4.32; P=0.014) on the follow-up MRI that were not seen on the baseline MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Covert neurological symptoms were associated with prevalent SBI, and when ascertained at the time of follow-up MRI, with new SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Covert symptoms may reflect heightened risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
