<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that in venous blood samples the erythrocyte aggregability (examined with a direct, highly sensitive, quantitative technique) was considerably more increased (by mean of 120%) than the blood plasma fibrinogen contents, blood plasma viscosity, and hematocrit which increased only by 23.7%, 7.4% and 3.6%, respectively, as compared to the same hemorheological factors in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results led us to the following conclusion: among the other tests the enhanced erythrocyte aggregability, when measured with an appropriate technique, is the best diagnostic indicator of hemorheological derangements during development of the ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
