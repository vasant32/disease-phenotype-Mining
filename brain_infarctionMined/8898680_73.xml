<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that depolarizations accelerate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth, we combined focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with externally evoked spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD) waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were produced in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anaesthetized rats by intraluminal thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one group of animals, repeated SDs were evoked at 15-min intervals by microinjections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32029">potassium acetate</z:chebi> into the frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another group, the spread of the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-evoked depolarizations was prevented by application of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> dizocilpine (MK-801) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volume of ischemic lesion was monitored for 2 h by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and correlated with electro-physiological recordings and biochemical imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In untreated rats, each microinjection produced an SD wave and a stepwise rise of the volume and signal intensity of the DWI-visible cortical lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volume of this lesion increased between 15 min and 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion from 19 +/- 15% to 66 +/- 16% of ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In dizocilpine-treated animals, microinjections of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> did not evoke SDs, nor did the volume and signal intensity of the DWI-visible cortical lesion change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 15 min after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the DWI-visible lesion was larger than in untreated animals-43 +/- 16% of the ipsilateral cortex; however, after 2 h, it increased only slightly further to 49 +/- 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Slower lesion growth in the absence of SDs was also reflected by the volume of ATP-depleted tissue, which, after 2 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, involved 26 +/- 12% of the ipsilateral cortex in treated and 49 +/- 9% in untreated animals (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations support the hypothesis that peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> depolarizations accelerate cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
