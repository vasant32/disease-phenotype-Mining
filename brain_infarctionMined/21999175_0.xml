<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is associated with morbidity and mortality, we need a better understanding of the factors that predict HT after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HT is a well-known factor that limits the use of thrombolytics and it negates the effect of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether a high serum ferritin level is associated with HT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven hundred and fifty-two consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 24 h after a vascular event were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HT was diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the HT was classified into hemorrhagic infarction (HI) type 1, 2 and parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (PH) type 1, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HT was also classified into no HT, asymptomatic HT, minor symptomatic HT (sHT), and major sHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computed tomography or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> showed HT in 90 patients (HI in 58 and PH in 32; asymptomatic in 53, minor symptomatic in 23 and major symptomatic in 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ferritin levels were higher in the patients who developed HT, PH and sHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounding variables, multivariate analysis showed that a high ferritin level remained an independent predictor of HT in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin levels higher than 171.8 ng/ml were independently associated with sHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a high ferritin level is an important predictor of HT, PH, and sHT in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lowering the ferritin level with iron-modifying agents or using free radical scavengers could be helpful to prevent HT in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
