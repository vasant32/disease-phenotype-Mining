<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups as follows: sham-operated group, untreated group, 20microg/kg, 40microg/kg and 80microg/kg MaFGF-treated groups and also the positive control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury was induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 2h followed by reperfusion for 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different dose of MaFGF were infused intravenously at 1h after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nimodipine was used as positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The behaviour deficit score, brain-infarcted area, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> degree, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) content and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity were detected at 24h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that MaFGF at the dose of 20microg/kg, 40microg/kg and 80microg/kg significantly alleviated brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to untreated group, the behaviour deficits were much less severe, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> alleviated obviously, the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> contents decreased and SOD activity increased dramatically in MaFGF-treated groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of MaFGF was similar to that of nimodipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that MaFGF has neuroprotective effect against brain injury resulting from focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion in Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
