<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of aspirin on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 238 patients with a first episode of hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of less than 24 h duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early neurological deterioration was diagnosed when the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale dropped 1 or more points between admission and 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> was determined on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients were undergoing treatment with 75-500 mg/day of aspirin at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations were higher in the group of patients not taking aspirin (8.9+/-5.2 vs. 4.9+/-3.1 microM/l, P&lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> had a 97% risk reduction of early neurological deterioration, and this effect remained unchanged after a further adjustment for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that low doses of aspirin may be useful in the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, not only for its antithrombotic properties, but also by direct neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
