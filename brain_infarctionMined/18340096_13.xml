<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to examine the feasibility of observing the lenticulostriate arteries (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e>) noninvasively by ultrahigh-field MRI with 7.0T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used 3-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography with a radiofrequency coil optimized for 7.0T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> of 6 healthy subjects and compared 7.0T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography images with 1.5T ones to examine the potentials of ultrahigh-field MRI for angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results show clear details of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> and their distribution in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects with large variations in the shapes, the number of branches and the sites of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also observed substantial differences between the left and right sides within each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although we studied only 6 subjects, we found no age- or gender-related differences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The visualization of microvasculature of the brain, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LSAs</z:e>, using 7.0T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, is possible in in vivo human studies noninvasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, believe that it could play a major role in the study of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, such as the early stages of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
