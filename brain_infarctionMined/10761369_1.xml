<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated 10 patients with right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> and 25 healthy controls using a task to uncouple deficits in sensory perceptual systems and motor-action output systems on directional hypometria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This task required participants, with their eyes closed, to reproduce lateral and medial horizontal displacements (15-27 cm) with each arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each participant was seated at a waist high table and had their hand placed at an origin point aligned with the axillary fold on the same side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their hand was moved by the investigator from the origin point to a target point and brought back to the point of origin (input displacement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The participant was then asked to return their hand to either the same target point or to an equidistant target point in the opposite direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Healthy dextral participants were significantly more hypometric with their right arm, but patients with right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> exhibited an opposite pattern with overall left arm hypometria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients were significantly more hypometric for movements when output displacements were toward left hemispace </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No effect was found for direction of sensory input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the directional hypometria is predominantly produced by hemispatial output deficits </plain></SENT>
