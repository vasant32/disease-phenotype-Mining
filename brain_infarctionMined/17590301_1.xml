<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a six-year-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008258'>congenital adrenal hyperplasia</z:hpo>, who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and unconsciousness during a hypoadrenal crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial neuroimaging revealed the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> with high signal changes in the fronto-parietal cortex on diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> worsened four days into admission, and by day 14 low-density areas were seen over the frontal lobes bilaterally using computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI at between one and two months of admission revealed extensive white matter lesions with high intensity on T2-weighted images (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, which extended into deep cortical layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, linear lesions with high signal change on T1-weighted imaging developed in the superficial cortical layers, with frontal predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This layer appeared isointense on T2WI and high intensity on FLAIR images, suggesting laminar cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two months later, linear, cavitary lesions appeared in the middle cortical layers between the aforementioned superficial laminar abnormality and deep cortex/white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high-intensity signals in the deep cortical layers remained contiguous with the white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This unique type of multi-layered cortical lesion may have resulted from a complex combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
