<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: After aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and occurrence of rebleeding and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are the main factors predicting outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated predictive risk factors for both early and late cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and whether time of appearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Previous diseases as well as clinical, laboratory and radiological variables including serial CT scans were recorded for 173 patients admitted within 48 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion by open surgery within 60 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors predicting occurrence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and poor outcome at 3 months according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale were tested using multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of several potential predictors, poor outcome was independently predicted by patient age, rebleeding, intraventricular haemorrhage, intracerebral haematoma, delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> with fixed symptoms and early new ischaemic lesion on CT scan appearing on the 1st post-operative morning (P&lt;0.01 for each factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounding factors, occurrence of early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (odds ratio 12.5; 95% confidence interval 3.2-48.7; P&lt;0.01), both early and late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (6.6; 1.1-40.4; P&lt;0.05), and late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> only (2.4; 0.6-9.1) increased risk for poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted independent significant risk factors for early infarction were duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> during surgery (1.4/min; 1.1-1.7, P&lt;0.01) and admission plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level (1.3 per mM; 1.0-1.6, P&lt;0.05) and for late infarction amount of subarachnoid blood (4.5; 1.3-14.9, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early infarction after surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion seems to have different risk factors and worse prognosis than late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> which is mostly associated with delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
