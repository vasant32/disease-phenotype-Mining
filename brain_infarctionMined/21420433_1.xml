<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood-flow velocities (BFVs) were measured in the internal carotid arteries and basilar trunk upstream from the circle of Willis, and in the posterior cerebral arteries downstream (1) before, (2) during left middle cerebral artery electrocoagulation and 50 min-transient either one (I/R-1) or both (I/R-2) common carotid (CCA) <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp>, and (3) after release of CCA(s) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> 41-48% (I/R-1 model) and 24% (I/R-2 model) of rats did not present a lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those rats displayed increased mean BFV in both right internal carotid artery and basilar trunk in I/R-1 model, and increased mean BFV in the basilar trunk (BT) in I/R-2 model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant changes in mean BFV were observed in lesioned rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mean BFV in the BT was inversely correlated to the size of the lesion (rÂ² = 0.75, p&lt;0.0001) in the I/R-2 model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we demonstrated the protective role of collateral support in P7 rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound imaging can evidence the establishment or not of the cerebral collateral recruitment, leading to the presence or absence of a lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This novel approach should greatly help preclinical studies to reduce animal variability </plain></SENT>
