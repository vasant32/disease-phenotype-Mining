<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to report on nine dysphagic patients with medullary infarction and to evaluate swallowing characteristics based on the location of the lesions.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of these nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medullary lesions were midlateral (three patients), dorsolateral (one patient), inferodorsolateral (four patients), and paramedian (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of the lesions were upper (four patients), middle (two patients), upper and middle (two patients), and middle and lower medulla (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> after medullary infarction was more common in patients with upper or middle medullary level and dorsolateral medullary level lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common findings on videofluoroscopic swallowing studies in patients with lateral medullary infarctions were impaired upper esophageal sphincter opening, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> from pyriform sinuses' residue caused by pharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and multiple swallowing to clear boluses from the pharynx to the esophagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with medullary infarctions, the lesion levels and loci and their related clinical findings can be useful in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> with serious complication is very common in patients with medullary infarctions, active diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are needed </plain></SENT>
