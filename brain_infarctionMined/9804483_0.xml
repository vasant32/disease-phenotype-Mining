<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This new modality seems to be especially useful for treating high risk patients, such as those with end-organ dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we retrospectively analyzed the results of ESG placement for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From January 1996 to December 1997, six patients with end-organ dysfunction (two with descending thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and four with abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) underwent ESG placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, with serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels of 2.0 mg/dl or greater, and the remaining patient had hepatic dysfunction with a prothrombin time less than 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the patients also had severe atherosclerotic disease with a history of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients received custom made endovascular spiral Z stents covered with a woven Dacron (DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE) graft, which was delivered via a femoral artery under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed significant changes in renal or hepatic function after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> needed hemodialysis after ESG placement, although the mean preoperative level of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen was 3.4 mg/dl and 42.0 mg/ dl, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients left the recovery room on postoperative day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that endovascular stent graft placement is extremely useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> patients with end-organ dysfunction </plain></SENT>
