<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little clinical experience with predicting neurologic outcome in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 4 comatose patients resuscitated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> treated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> whose in-hospital neurologic prognosis was determined by board-certified neurologists to be grave, yet were ultimately discharged from the hospital with no or minimal neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report 4 comatose patients resuscitated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> treated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On hospital admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Score between 3 and 6 and a FOUR Score between 1 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (32 degrees C - 33 degrees C) was implemented for 24 to 40 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination by board-certified neurologists before and during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> or the rewarming phase suggested a grave prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 patients had sudden and dramatic neurologic recovery 9 to 24 hours after rewarming to normothermia and were ultimately discharged with no or minimal neurocognitive sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case series suggests that neurologic assessment-based prognosis of patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> undergoing therapeutic mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> should be considered unreliable for at least the first 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of additional assessments such as brain injury markers or evoked potentials, in addition to clinical examination, should be strongly considered to help determine an estimated prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional reversibility after a global insult could be an intrinsic potential of the brain, similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206146" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial stunning</z:e>, and deserves investigation </plain></SENT>
