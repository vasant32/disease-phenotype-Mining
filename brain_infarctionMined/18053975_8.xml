<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In situations with energy failure, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transport is impaired and high levels of this amino acid accumulate on the synaptic cleft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our group has showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> exerts neuroprotection against neurotoxicity situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work is draw a post-ischemic profile of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake and cell damage using an oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation model (OGD) in hippocampal slices from young (P10) and adult (P60) rats, analyzing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OGD decreases <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake in both ages and recovery times, although decrease in cell viability was only observed 1 and 3 h after OGD in young and adult animals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">Guanosine</z:chebi> partially protected cell damage from 1 h in P10 and at 3 h in P60 rats and avoided <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> uptake decrease from P10 rats at 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impairment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporters since immediately after the insult observed here is probably due to an energetic failure; <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> viability was only observed from 1 h after OGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> acts in the 'ischemic' model used here is still unknown, but evidence leads to its antiapoptotic effect </plain></SENT>
