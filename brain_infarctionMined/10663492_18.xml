<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reliable noninvasive method is desirable for assessing the safety of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is sensitive to early brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> which becoming widely available and might therefore serve this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 19 patients referred for investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> by echo-planar whole-brain DWI before and within 24 h of stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The images obtained at a high b value were examined by two independent blinded reviewers for new high-signal areas consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 15 patients had no new changes after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient showed enlargement of a posterior watershed lesion after the procedure, which correlated with an increase in neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three other patients had presumed small embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on DWI; two were asymptomatic and one had <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> at the hand that corresponded to an embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with a lesion on DWI in the hand notch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no false- positive or -negative results on DWI, when compared to clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DWI is thus a new method that can demonstrate neurologically silent or asymptomatic infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can be used to help to assess the safety and efficacy of neurovascular intervention </plain></SENT>
