<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Biochemical markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neuronal injury may aid in the diagnosis and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from the National Institute for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study were analyzed for the presence of 4 biochemical markers of neuronal, glial, and endothelial cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These biochemical markers, myelin basic protein (MBP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S100beta, and soluble thrombomodulin, were studied for an association with initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the original NINDS study, serum samples were drawn from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients on presentation to the Emergency Department and at approximately 2 and 24 hours after initiation of study therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, stored serum samples were available for 359 patients; 107 patients had samples for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum marker concentrations were measured by ELISA techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the relation between serum concentrations of each marker and the degree of baseline neurological deficit, functional outcome, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size on computed tomography at 24 hours and the effect of fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher 24-hour peak concentrations of MBP, NSE, and S100beta were associated with higher National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale baseline scores (r=0.186, P&lt;0.0001; r=0.117, P=0.032; and r=0.263, P&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher peak concentrations of MBP and S100beta (r=0.209, P&lt;0.0001; r=0.239, P&lt;0.0001) were associated with larger computed tomography lesion volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with favorable outcomes had smaller changes in MBP and S100beta (P&lt;0.05) concentrations in the first 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Soluble thrombomodulin was not associated with any severity or outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study corroborates previous work demonstrating correlations of MBP, NSE, and S100beta with clinical and radiographic features in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite significantly better outcomes in the tissue plasminogen activator-treated group, we found no difference in the early release of the 4 biomarkers between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study will define the role of biomarkers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management and prognostication </plain></SENT>
