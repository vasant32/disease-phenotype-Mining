<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We recently observed that 13% of 1,008 consecutive adults aged 15-49 years with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> had one or more silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBIs), and more than 5% presented with leukoaraiosis on CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the features of and risk factors for magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>)-defined SBIs and leukoaraiosis in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the radiologic features of SBIs and leukoaraiosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-scanned patients (n = 669) blinded to clinical data and examined their relation with subtype of the overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to identify factors predisposing to SBIs and leukoaraiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 669 patients included, 86 (13%) had SBIs, 50 (7%) had leukoaraiosis, 17 (3%) had both, and 550 had no SBIs or leukoaraiosis and served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority (54%) had a single SBI, 20% had two SBIs, and 27% had three or more SBIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most SBIs were located in basal ganglia (39%) or subcortical regions (21%), but cerebellar SBIs also were rather frequent (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leukoaraiosis was mainly mild to moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for SBIs were type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 5.78, 95% confidence interval 2.37-14.10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR 2.12, 1.07-4.19), smoking (OR 1.69, 1.05-2.72), and increasing age (OR 1.08, 1.04-1.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for leukoaraiosis were type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 9.75, 3.39-28.04), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR 2.42, 1.04-5.68), female sex (OR 2.25, 1.16-4.34), and increasing age (OR 1.19, 1.10-1.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Small-vessel disease was the predominant cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in both those with SBIs (31%) and leukoaraiosis (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and leukoaraiosis are not uncommon among young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients--type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> being the strongest risk factor </plain></SENT>
