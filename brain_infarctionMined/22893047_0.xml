<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The length of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospital stay (LOS) is an indicator of efficiency in the treatment of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> I63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the development of the LOS over 10 years and to analyze influencing factors with a focus on the structural level of hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Routine treatment data for the years 2000 to 2009 generated within the quality assurance project "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Register Northwest Germany" formed the basis of our analyses (n = 175,149) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the infrastructure and equipment of the hospitals were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information regarding the bed density on county level was provided by the statistical offices of the federal German states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median LOS was calculated for each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a linear multilevel analysis of the influencing factors stratified by hospital specialty was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LOS after an ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> decreased by several days over the years 2000 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between the specialties neurology vs. internal and geriatric medicine diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A small part of variation in LOS was explained by the factors measured on the three levels patient, hospital and county </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The biggest proportion of variance was explained by socio-demographic and clinical factors measured on patient level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital equipment contributed somewhat additionally to the explanation of variance for hospitals specializing in internal and geriatric medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were differences between the medical specialties both with regard to the associations observed and the distribution of variance on the three levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a reduction of the LOS in patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A stratified analysis according to medical specialty seems necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Single features of the hospital infrastructure are associated with the LOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the interpretation of these associations is in part difficult </plain></SENT>
