<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low wall shear stress (WSS) is an early marker in the development of vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to assess the relationship between diastolic and systolic WSS in the internal carotid artery and periventricular (PWML), deep white matter lesions, and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Early, mid, and late diastolic and peak systolic WSS were derived from shear rate obtained by gradient echo phase contrast magnetic resonance sequences multiplied by individually modeled viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PWML, deep white matter lesions, and CI were derived from proton density (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), T2, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI in 329 participants (70-82 years; PROSPER baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted, if appropriate, for age, gender, intracranial volume, and multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mid-diastolic WSS was significantly correlated with the presence of PWML (B=-10.15; P=0.006) and CI (B=-2.06; P=0.044), but not with deep white matter lesions (B=-1.30; P=0.050; adjusted for age, gender, WML, and intracranial volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, these correlations weakened but remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic WSS was not correlated with any of the cerebrovascular parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to our knowledge to present a cross-sectional correlation between carotid artery WSS and cerebrovascular pathology such as PWML and CI in a large population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it shows that diastolic hemodynamics may be more important than systolic or mean hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies exploring vascular hemodynamic damage should focus on diastolic WSS </plain></SENT>
