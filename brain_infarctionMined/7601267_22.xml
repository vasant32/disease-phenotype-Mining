<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to study if enriched housing conditions and fetal neocortical transplantation could enhance the functional outcome after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was ligated in 34 inbred, spontaneously hypertensive male rats, which were then randomly divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups A and B were transferred to an enriched environment, i.e., a large cage with opportunities for various activities but not forcing the rats to do any particular tasks; group C was kept in standard laboratory cages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion blocks of fetal neocortical tissue (Embryonic Day 17) were transplanted to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cavity in groups B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats in group A (n = 11) and group B (n = 11) performed equally well and significantly better than rats in group C (n = 10) when placed on an inclined plane and when traversing a rotating pole 6 and 9 weeks after the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and in a leg placement test at 9, but not 6 and 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skilled forelimb function did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size and thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> did not differ between the groups and graft size was similar in group B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and motor function in any of the tests in rats housed in an enriched environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the environment can significantly alter functional outcome without reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size we suggest that more attention should be given to the role of the laboratory environment and to long term behavioral outcome in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
