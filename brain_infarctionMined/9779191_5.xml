<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In permanent middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) model, the treatments were induced 15 min following the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were kept at the desired rectal or brain temperature (about 32 degrees C) for 30 min; (each, n = 6) and for 1 hr (each, n = 6), and then allowed to rewarm spontaneously, whereas control animals were kept at normothermia throughout the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The volumes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were assessed 24 hr post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood flow of the dorsolateral cortex was monitored by Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in the other experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was attenuated only in the animals treated for 1 hr with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (49.2%, P &lt; 0.001) and selective brain cooling (26.7%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> was diminished only in the animals treated with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for 1 hr (23.6%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LDF examination revealed a sharp drop in blood flow upon <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and maintaining in low blood flow throughout the experiment in the control and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the selective brain cooling, the reduced blood flow increased from 40% to 70% of baseline value while the brain was rewarmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that mild systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has much stronger protective effects against focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> than selective brain cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of protective effects of selective brain cooling may be caused by post-cooling cerebral hyperemia in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> area </plain></SENT>
