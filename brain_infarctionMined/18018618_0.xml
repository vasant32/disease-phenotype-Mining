<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were 71-year-old and 73-year-old men who suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> of the left posterior cerebral artery and right middle cerebral artery territory, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both of them were diagnosed as having cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After transferred to rehabilitation hospitals taking aspirin for a secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, they developed hemorrhagic infarction at day 17 and day 19, respectively </plain></SENT>
