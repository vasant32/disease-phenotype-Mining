<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the association of white matter lesions and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with cognitive performance and whether brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> mediates these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the Second Manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arterial Disease</z:e>-Magnetic Resonance study (2001-2005, the Netherlands), cross-sectional analyses of 522 patients were performed (mean age, 57 years (standard deviation, 10); 76% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain segmentation was used to quantify volumes of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were rated visually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain volume, ventricular volume, and gray matter volume were divided by intracranial volume to obtain indicators of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological tests assessing executive functioning and memory were performed, and scores were transformed into z scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors used linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, education, intelligence, and vascular risk factors, to investigate the association of white matter lesions and number of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 1-standard-deviation higher volume of white matter lesions (beta = -0.12, 95% confidence interval: -0.20, -0.04) and the presence of &gt;or=2 lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (beta = -0.48, 95% confidence interval: -0.87, -0.09) were associated with worse executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations remained after adjusting for brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both were not associated with worse memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that subcortical ischemic vascular lesions are associated with decreased executive functioning, but not with memory functioning, independent of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
