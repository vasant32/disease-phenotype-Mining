<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this study we investigated whether cerebrospinal fluid in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> possesses an activity that contributes to the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a test, the effect of cerebrospinal fluid on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx into the intracellular space was chosen because this process is a mechanism for vasospasm, platelet aggregation as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, and neuron damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Effects of cerebrospinal fluid taken from 48 patients with cerebral hemispheric infarction on the concentration of cytosolic free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> in platelets were studied using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probe</z:chebi> quin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric cerebral blood flow was measured using 133Xe intravenous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid in 19 of 48 patients with cerebral hemispheric infarction increased the level of cytosolic free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> in platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The course of the disease in the patients who showed a positive effect of cerebrospinal fluid on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, when compared with that of patients who showed a negative effect, was characterized by a more severe clinical manifestation and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in hemispheric cerebral blood flow was more marked in both ischemic and contralateral hemispheres in patients with positive effects of cerebrospinal fluid on the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the ability of cerebrospinal fluid to evoke <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx into the intracellular space in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> is a factor that aggravates ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
