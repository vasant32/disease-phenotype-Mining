<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the possible role of HB-EGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury by measuring the changes in its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined neural damage after a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and reperfusion in ventral forebrain specific HB-EGF knockout (KO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of HB-EGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cerebral cortex of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice were significantly increased 3-24 h after MCAO and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral infraction in HB-EGF KO mice was aggravated at 1 day and 6 days after MCAO and reperfusion compared with WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dNTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) positive cells, were higher in HB-EGF KO mice than in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, fewer bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) positive cells were found in the subventricular zone in HB-EGF KO mice compared with WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that HB-EGF may play a pivotal role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury and that endogenously synthesized HB-EGF is necessary for both the neuroprotective effect and for regulation of cell proliferation in the subventricular zone </plain></SENT>
