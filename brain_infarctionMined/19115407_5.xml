<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in gerbil by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> monensin or <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blocker <z:chebi fb="2" ids="9506">tetrodotoxin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi>) was administered at doses of 10 micorg/kg, i.p., 30 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction; the dose was repeated after 22 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> occurred, determined at 24 hr after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large, well-demarcated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed in both hemispheres, an important observation because it critically influences the interpretation of the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production is thought to be related to ischemic neuronal damage, we examined increases in Ca(2+) influx, which lead to the activation of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then we evaluated the contributions of neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS, and inducible NOS to NO production in brain cryosections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytosolic release of apoptogenic molecules like <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and p53 were confirmed after 24 hr of reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling) labeling detected the apoptotic cells, which were confirmed in neuron-rich cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 24 hr, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the ischemic changes were amplified by monensin and significantly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the nesting behavior and histological outcomes were examined after 7 day of reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuronal damage in the hippocampal area and significant decrease in nesting scores were observed with monensin treatment and reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi> pretreatment after day 7 of reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this report is the first to highlight the involvement of the voltage-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel in possibly regulating in part NO system and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-dependent manner in global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil, and thus warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
