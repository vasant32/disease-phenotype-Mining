<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> do not respond well to treatment, the search for molecular tissue markers will gain importance for future studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anecdotal observations of infarctions after surgery for chiasmatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> during central reviewing initiated this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 84 patients, histology was obtained during 102 interventions in the years 1992-2009 by 33 biopsies, 67 partial/subtotal and 2 total resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age at the time of operation was 5 years (mean 5 years 11 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could identify 17 infarctions following partial resection of chiasmatic LGG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were not complicated by infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children developing infarction were considerably younger (median 3 years; mean 4 years 5 months) than the patients without infarction (median 5 years 4 months; mean 6 years 2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 51 patients with cerebellar LGG (median 7 years; mean 7 years 4 months) served as a control group, with 65 surgical procedures (2 biopsies, 22 partial/subtotal resections and 41 total resections) performed in the years 2004-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one total resection (1.5%) in this group was followed by infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Partial/subtotal resections of chiasmatic LGG in our study population bear a considerable risk for infarction especially in young children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As there is currently no evidence for a better outcome after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> resection, we suggest that the sampling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue should be performed via biopsies whenever possible </plain></SENT>
