<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of an early CT finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> where CT examination was obtained within the first 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT examination showed blurred outlines and decreased attenuation of the left lentiform nucleus, loss of the white-gray matter interface in the left insular cortex and left cortical global hypoattenuation with obliteration of left cortical sulci in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In second patient CT showed the following: hyperdense left middle cerebral artery, loss of clear margins of left lentiform nucleus, subtle focal cortical hypodensity in the left fronto-parietal area with signs of mass effect in the form of ventricular compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT is still the first choice in the deferential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although older literature positions have suggested that CT was negative during the first 48 hours, modern CT technology can demonstrate positive findings even in the first 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is important in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as thrombolytic therapy when elected, has to be given within the first 3-6 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine how early and reliably ischemic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be detected on CT scanning, we report two cases of an early CT finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> where CT examination was obtained within the first 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
