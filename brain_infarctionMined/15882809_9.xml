<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to eight groups (n=8 in each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals in the control group received no treatment, and animals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EA1</z:e>-EA4 groups received EA at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h before induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats in DPCPX group were intraperitoneally injected with 1 mg kg-1 8-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52880">cyclopentyl</z:chebi>-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), 3 h before induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals in vehicle group and EA+DPCPX group were pretreated with 1 ml kg-1 dimethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35813">sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO, the solvent of DPCPX) and 1 mg kg-1 DPCPX 30 min before preconditioning with EA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats were anesthetized with 40 mg kg-1 pentobarbital <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals that required EA preconditioning, received EA with intensity of 1 mA and frequency of 15 Hz at the Baihui acupoint (GV 20) for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by the right middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficit scores (NDS) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were evaluated at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats survived until 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning with EA at 2 h before induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> improved neurologic outcome (P&lt;0.05 versus control) and reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P&lt;0.01 versus control) at 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These beneficial effects were reversed by pretreatment with 1 mg kg-1 DPCPX, whereas this agent itself did not affect the NDS and volume in drug-ischemic controls after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results show that preconditioning with single EA session induces rapid tolerance to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rapid ischemic tolerance appears at 2 h (but not at 0.5, 1, or 3 h) after preconditioning, and is possibly mediated through an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor-related mechanism </plain></SENT>
