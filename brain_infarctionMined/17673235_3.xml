<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> has been known as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as a risk for cerebrovascular disease is less well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether inflammatory processes, excluded from their involvement in large-vessel disease, are implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were associated with an increased number of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or severity of white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a community-based group of Japanese elderly (n=689), CRP concentrations were measured using a highly sensitive assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebral small vessel disease-related lesions (lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter hyperintensity) were subsequently evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was also assessed with ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the grades of white matter hyperintensity and the numbers of lacunes were considered small vessel disease-related lesions, we evaluated the relationships between CRP levels and small vessel disease-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the median CRP concentration of our participants was remarkably lower, being approximately one third or one quarter of the value of Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects with higher CRP levels tended to have more small vessel disease-related lesions; however, these associations were not seen after adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between CRP levels and small vessel disease-related lesions was not apparent in the community-based Japanese elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of small vessel disease-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> seems to be weak among the Japanese elderly </plain></SENT>
