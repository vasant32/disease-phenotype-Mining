<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Leiden V mutation, which causes activated protein C resistance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, has been found to be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) D allele indirectly exerts an unfavourable effect on the vasoregulatory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the frequency of these mutations was analysed in different subtypes of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND MATERIAL: According to the clinical and radiological features 664 Hungarian patients who had suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were divided into 3 subtypes: small and large vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and a mixed type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 664 patients, the Leiden V mutation and ACE I/D polymorphism were examined by means of the PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the different genotypes for the Leiden V mutation and ACE I/D polymorphism in the 3 subgroups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were compared with 199 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free control subjects whose MRI findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant associations were found between the overall group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> and the Leiden V, ACE I/D and ACE D/D genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ACE D/D genotype was significantly more common in the patients with small deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (40.3%; p &lt; 0.0005; OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.49-3.57) than in the control group (22.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Leiden V mutation was significantly more common in patients with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (13.6%; p &lt; 0.025; OR 2.25, CI 1.16-4.34) than in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free control subjects (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ACE D/D genotype possibly contributes to the occurrence of small-vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> rather than large vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Leiden V mutation might predispose to large brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither the Leiden V factor nor the ACE D/D genotype has been proved to be a risk factor for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a whole </plain></SENT>
