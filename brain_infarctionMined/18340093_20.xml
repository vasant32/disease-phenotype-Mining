<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leukoaraiosis (LA) is associated with structural and functional vascular changes that may compromise tissue perfusion at the microvascular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the volume of LA correlated with the proportion of initially ischemic but eventually infarcted tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 61 consecutive patients with diffusion-weighted imaging-mean transit time mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were scanned twice within 12 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and between days 4 and 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We explored the relationship between the volume of white matter regions with LA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> images and the proportion of diffusion-weighted imaging-mean transit time mismatch tissue that progressed to infarction (percentage mismatch lost) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed a statistically significant correlation between percentage mismatch lost and LA volume (r=0.33, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A linear regression model with percentage mismatch lost as response and LA volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> diffusion-weighted imaging and mean transit time volumes, age, admission blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, admission mean arterial blood pressure, etiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MRI, and time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and follow-up imaging as covariates revealed that LA volume was an independent predictor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjusted percentage mismatch lost in the highest quartile of LA volume was 1.9-fold (95% CI: 1.2 to 3.1) greater than the percentage mismatch lost in the lowest quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LA volume at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is a predictor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because LA is associated with factors that modulate tissue perfusion as well as tissue capacity for handling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, LA volume appears to be a composite predictive marker for the fate of acutely ischemic tissue </plain></SENT>
