<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 780 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, 125 had complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (16%) and 44 (35.2%) of these died in hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high NIHSS-score (OR 1.17 95%CI 1.03-1.34, P=0.013) and high diastolic blood pressure on admission (OR 1.05 95%CI 1.01-1.09) resulted being independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median value of diastolic blood pressure at admission was 90 mmHg in patients who died and 80 mmHg in survivors (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> increased by 5% for each mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure on admission after adjusting for other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of mortality was 22% in patients with diastolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg, 56% for those with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 109 mmHg and 67% for those with diastolic blood pressure higher than 110 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that high diastolic blood pressure on admission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is linearly correlated with in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
