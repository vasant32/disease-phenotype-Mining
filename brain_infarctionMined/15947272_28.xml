<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue destruction produced by the neuroinflammatory response that follows <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we use an MMP array to investigate the blood levels of several MMPs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and its relation with brain tissue damage and neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who received thrombolytic therapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn before tissue plasminogen activator treatment and an MMP array (multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) was performed including gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13), stromelysines (MMP-3 and MMP-10), and MMP endogen inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess tissue lesion a serial multimodal MRI study was performed (pretreatment and at 24 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither initial diffusion lesion nor hypoperfused volume was associated with metalloproteinase expression within the first 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a strong correlation was found between MMP-9 and MMP-13 with diffusion-weighted image (DWI) lesion expansion (r=0.54, P=0.05 and r=0.60, P=0.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline levels of both MMP-9 (OR, 14;95% CI, 1.5 to 131; P=0.019) and MMP-13 (OR, 73; 95% CI, 3.9 to 1388; P=0.004) were independent predictors of final increase in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that within the neuroinflammatory response, high levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 are involved in DWI lesion growth despite thrombolytic therapy, suggesting its ultra-early role in brain injury </plain></SENT>
