<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SCIs), defined as lesions &gt; or = 3 mm in diameter on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is considered a predictor of symptomatic cerebrovascular disorders (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, SCI-like lesions &lt; 3 mm in diameter, lesions which often occur in the deep white matter and basal ganglia, also may be a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the relationships between SCI and SCI-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e>, as defined by MRI, and 2 findings on extracranial carotid ultrasonography: intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied data obtained by carotid ultrasonography and cerebral MRI in 448 consecutive subjects without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had undergone comprehensive brain screening (mean age, 51.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were classified into 4 groups according to the presence of increased (&gt; or = 1 mm) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (I) and plaque (P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 110 subjects demonstrated increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (24.6%), and 54 subjects had increased plaque (12.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SCI-like lesions were found in 38 subjects (8.5%); single SCI, in 24 (5.4%); and multiple SCIs, in 51 (11.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of SCI-like lesion(s), single SCI, and multiple SCIs were 6.1%, 12.2%, and 8.7%, respectively, in the I(-)P(-) group; 14.6%, 22.0%, and 13.4% in the I(+)P(-) group; 7.7%, 30.8%, and 26.9% in the I(-)P(+) group; and 17.9%, 39.3%, and 21.4% in the I(+)P(+) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis found that the presence of carotid plaques was significantly associated with (1) SCI-like lesion(s) and SCI (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-4.34), (2) single and multiple SCI (OR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.16-4.67), and (3) multiple SCIs (OR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.06-5.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of increased carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was not significantly associated with any of these 3 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coexistence of increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and plaque was more strongly correlated with SCI than with either lesion alone </plain></SENT>
