<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the pathophysiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be highly relevant to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase therapies, discriminating between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study of the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the first 6 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data from 1367 patients in the Glycine <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">Antagonist</z:chebi> In Neuroprotection (GAIN) Americas trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Trial of ORG10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) category "small vessel (lacunar)" disease at day 7 or at hospital discharge was used as the reference standard to determine the accuracy of a diagnosis of a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> made within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> using the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project (OCSP) classification "LACS." Outcome was analyzed by comparing the proportions of patients classified as "LACS" at baseline or "small vessel (lacunar)" at 7 days who were dead or dependent at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive predictive value of an OCSP diagnosis of a lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 76% (95% CI: 69% to 81%; sensitivity 64% [95% CI: 58% to 70%]; specificity 96% [95% CI: 95% to 97%]; negative predictive value 93% [95% CI: 92% to 94%]; accuracy 91% [95% CI: 89% to 92%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-month outcomes of patients classified as either OCSP "LACS" within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or TOAST "small vessel (lacunar)" at 7 days were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An OCSP LACS diagnosis made within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is reasonably predictive of a final diagnosis of "small vessel (lacunar)" disease made using TOAST criteria and has a similar relationship to outcome at 3 months </plain></SENT>
