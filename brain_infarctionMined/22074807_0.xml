<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of the reported ALOX5AP associations have considered non-radiologically confirmed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association of genetic variants in ALOX5AP with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> defined by the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 202 persons with MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 487 healthy individuals of Caribbean Hispanic ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another sample of European ancestry comprised 1823 persons with MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 7578 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were genotyped for the 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that define ALOX5AP HapA haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was found between SNPs and MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support the hypothesis that variants in ALOX5AP are associated with risk of MRI-defined brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
