<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the small size of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, progression of neurological deficits is a common problem in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This investigation studied the frequency and the course of neurological deterioration as well as predictors and possible underlying pathomechanisms of early progression in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourty-six consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively evaluated by daily clinical neurological examination including the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and follow-up using the Barthel Index after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progressive neurological deficit was defined as worsening by &gt; or =1 point in the NIHSS for motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progressive and stable patients were compared regarding clinical profile, inflammatory parameters (leukocytes, body temperature, C-reactive protein), coagulation parameters (fibrinogen, D-dimer, vWF, PTT), and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> plasma concentration, as well as blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients (23.9%) showed progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms, 9 of these within the first 24 h after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The score on the NIHSS on admission was similar in patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and stable patients, but significantly higher in the progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group on days 2 (p = 0.01), 3 (p = 0.001) and at discharge (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deterioration was significantly associated with a higher leukocyte count (p = 0.012), higher body temperature (p = 0.031) and a higher fibrinogen concentration (p = 0.046) on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Barthel Index at discharge (p = 0.001) and after 90 days (p &lt; 0.001) was significantly worse in the progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Progression in lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> usually occurs within 24 h and may be related to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long-term prognosis of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is persistently worse compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
