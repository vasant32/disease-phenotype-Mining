<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The increasing number of neurosurgical procedures for elderly patients and the development of skull base neurosurgery have increased interest in cerebral venous injury that might occur in a neurosurgical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may have neuroprotective effects against cerebral venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intraventricular effects of BDNF infusion on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in cerebral venous ischemic lesions in a rat 2-vein occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three male Wistar rats were randomly divided into BDNF-treated and vehicle control groups; each group was further randomly divided into 2-day and 7-day postocclusion groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BDNF (2.1 μg/day) or vehicle was delivered continuously via intraventricular infusion pumps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two adjacent contralateral cortical veins were then photochemically occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two and 7 days after occlusion, we histologically measured ratios of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume to contralateral hemisphere volume and counted (2-day group) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic cells in the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rCBF was measured via full-field laser perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after venous occlusion was significantly smaller in BDNF-treated rats than in controls at 2 days (1.49 ± 1.44% vs 3.66 ± 1.51%; P &lt; .05) and 7 days (0.93 ± 0.47% vs 1.69 ± 0.58%; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two days after occlusion, there were significantly fewer TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in the BDNF-treated rats (17.0 ± 15.1) than in the controls (39.0 ± 19.6; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After 2-vein occlusion, continuous intraventricular administration of BDNF protected the cerebral cortex against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size without affecting rCBF </plain></SENT>
