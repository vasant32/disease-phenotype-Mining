<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Spinal Cord Infarction</z:e> (SCI) is a rare and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596452" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disabling disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hospital-based study was conducted for clinical evaluation of SCI patients in east of Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consecutive SCI patients admitted in Ghaem hospital,Mashhad during 2006-2010 were enrolled in a prospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of SCI was made by neurologists and radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographic features, clinical syndrome, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients underwent a standard battery of diagnostic investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients suspected to SCI had MRI of spinal cord at the symptomatic level of cord with a 0.5 Tesla generation, Philips NT Intra, Netherland equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An equal number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Infarction</z:e> (BI) were randomly selected from our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry data bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Etiology and degree of disability were compared between these groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fourteen SCI patients (9 females, 5 males) with mean age 38.8 Â± SD: 19.9 years were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Miscellaneous causes consisted 50% of etiologies in patients with SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Uncertain etiology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and cardioembolisms consisted 35.7%, 7.1%, and 7.1% of SCI causes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Distribution of etiologies was significantly different between SCI and BI patients, X(2) = 12.94, df = 3, P = .003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Difference in mean disability score at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not significant between two studied groups, z = 1.54, P = .057 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Difference in mean changes of disability score at 90 days postevent was significant in two groups of patients, z = 2.65, P = .019 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>SCI is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> with poor recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Distribution of etiologies of SCI patients is quite different than of BI patients </plain></SENT>
