<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work from our laboratory has shown that despite a greater susceptibility to brain damage, the immature brain recovers more rapidly and to a greater extent than does the more mature <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we examined the influence of environmental enrichment on the effects of age on the brain damaging effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats aged 10, 63, and 180 days received ischemic insults following stereotactic intra-cerebral injection of endothelin-1, and resulting in injury to the right middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were then housed in either environmentally enriched cages, or standard cages for 60 days, after which they were sacrificed, and brain volumes determined for the extent of neurologic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats receiving the insult at 10 days of age showed a reduction of pathologic injury when housed in the enriched cages compared to standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, rats receiving the insult at 180 days and housed environmentally enriched cages actually showed an increased volume of brain damage compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings clearly indicate the dramatic influence of age on the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the influence of rehabilitative therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Behavioral correlation to morphologic alterations is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Attempts at therapeutic interventions clearly need to be age-specific </plain></SENT>
