<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact incidence of venous infarction following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> surgery has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine this incidence, we present a large multivariate analysis of 705 patients undergoing craniotomy for resection of a histologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> at our institution between 1991 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical information was retrospectively reconstructed using patient medical records and radiologic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous infarctions were identified by postoperative CT scans or MRI that demonstrated the typical imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association with approach used and the rate of venous infarction, controlling for multiple independent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of venous infarction (n=705) was 2.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-3.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, on multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found the use of a bifrontal craniotomy was the sole independent predictor of venous infarction in this regression model (odds ratio, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.03-9.77; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that the rate of venous infarction was significantly reduced in the extended bifrontal group compared to the group not receiving biorbital osteotomies (0% versus 8.9%, Ï‡(2)p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the most important factor determining the risk of venous infarction is the approach used to access the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
