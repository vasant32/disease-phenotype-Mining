<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether EEG parameters are of additional diagnostic and prognostic value in the early phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-four patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation syndrome (ACS) of presumed ischemic origin were incrementally included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics were correlated with volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and EEG parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictive values for definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, early neurological deterioration, spontaneous early neurological improvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 1 week after ACS were calculated using ROC curves and logistic regression modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NIHSS score of 0 or 1, the pairwise derived brain symmetry index (pdBSI) was an independent predictor for definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> displaying an overall accuracy of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early neurological deterioration was independently predicted by pdBSI with a correct classification rate of 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ROC analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was predicted by pdBSI with overall accuracy of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous neurological improvement was independently predicted by the delta+theta/alpha+beta - ratio with overall accuracy of 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was independently predicted by pdBSI with a correct classification rate of 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EEG may be of prognostic value for spontaneous neurological improvement, early neurological deterioration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation syndrome of presumed ischemic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These findings may have an impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
