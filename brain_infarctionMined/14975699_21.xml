<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this aim, permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) was performed in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume of some inhibitors, such as tyrosine-6 glycosylated form of the exchanger inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (GLU-XIP), benzamil derivative (CB-DMB) and diarylaminopropylamine derivative (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi>), and of the NCX activator, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi>, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi>, CB-DMB, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> and GLU-XIP, a modified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> synthesized in our laboratory in order to facilitate its entrance into the cells through the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter, were intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30810">FeCl3 </z:chebi>(10 microg/kg) was able to reduce the extension of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was counteracted by the concomitant icv administration of CB-DMB (120 microg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> NCX inhibitors, GLU-XIP, CB-DMB and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi>, caused a worsening of the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a stimulation of NCX activity may help neurons and glial cells that are not irreversibly damaged in the penumbral zone to survive, whereas its pharmacological blockade can compromise their survival </plain></SENT>
