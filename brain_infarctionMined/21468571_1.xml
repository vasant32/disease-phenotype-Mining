<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate whether PROG inhibits the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: a sham-operated (control) group, a permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) group, a vehicle-treated group and a PROG-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After pMCAO, the rats received an initial intraperitoneal injection of PROG (8 mg/kg) or vehicle at 1 h post-occlusion, followed by subcutaneous injections at 6, 24 and 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and CD68 in the brain were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was detected by spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed 72 h after surgery and isolated brain was sectioned into coronal slices and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and spectrophotometry revealed that the expression levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CD68 and MPO were reduced in the brain tissue of PROG-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, PROG-treated rats showed a substantial reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume compared to vehicle controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PROG effectively inhibited the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and reduced the infiltration of leukocytes in the ischemic brain by inhibiting the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 </plain></SENT>
