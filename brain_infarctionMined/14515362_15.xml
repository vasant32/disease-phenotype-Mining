<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proposed in vivo function, however, remains contradictory; One study reported that targeted disruption of the jip1 caused embryonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to the requirement of JIP1 for fertilized eggs (Thompson et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>15:2421-2432) demonstrated that JIP1-deficient mice were viable and that the JIP1 null mutation inhibited the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi>-induced JNK activation and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to re-elucidate the in vivo roles of JIP1 using newly generated JIP1 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our JIP1-deficient mice were viable and healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The transient focal ischemic insult produced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) strongly activated JNK in brain of jip1(+/+), jip1(+/-), and jip1(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased JNK activity was sustained for more than 22 hr in jip1(+/+) and jip1(+/-), whereas it was repressed rapidly in jip1(-/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume produced by the ischemic insult in jip1(-/-) was reduced notably compared to that in jip1(+/+) brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that JIP1 plays a pivotal role in regulating the maintenance of phosphorylated JNK and neuronal survival in postischemic brain, but is not essential for JNK activation and early development </plain></SENT>
