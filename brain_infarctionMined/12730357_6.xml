<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BN 80933, an original compound associating an inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase with an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, has been shown to reduce functional and histological damage in rat submitted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to confirm these results in mice and to further examine the effects of BN 80933 on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, including blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and neutrophil infiltration after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of BN 80933 at 3 and 10 mg/kg 3 h after MCAO significantly reduced by 26 to 36% the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume evaluated 24 and 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and improved the neurological score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BN 80933 at both dosages decreased by 42 to 75% the extravasation of Evans blue in brain parenchyma observed 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption was associated with decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> as demonstrated by the 37% reduction in brain water content induced by BN 80933 at 3 mg/kg 24 h after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration in brain parenchyma, evaluated by the myeloperoxidase activity, was also reduced by 45 to 56% in animals treated with BN 80933 at 3 and 10 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results extend the protective capacity of BN 80933 against brain ischemic injury and confirm that BN 80933 represents a promising treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
