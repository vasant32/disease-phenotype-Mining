<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> patterns on brain imaging contribute to the etiologic classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of specific subtypes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and etiologic mechanisms is often weak, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions are frequently missed on initial computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is superior in visualizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions as compared to CT and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our prospective study, we addressed the question whether a distinct pattern of infarction on DWI is associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> etiology and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two patients with clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CT upon admission underwent DWI within 10 days after the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was documented using the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A scattered lesion pattern was defined by at least 2 separate hyperintense DWI lesions within the territory of one of the major cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions were defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> if the region was demarcated strongly hyperintense in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> DW images, and if the apparent diffusion coefficient was below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 32 patients, DWI revealed a scattered lesion pattern, while in 30 patients a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesion was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with scattered lesions, potential arterial or cardiac embolic sources were detected in 26 patients (81.3%), as compared to 5 patients (16.6%) in the group with single lesions (chi(2) test, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neurological status of patients with scattered lesions improved significantly more than among patients with single lesions (Mann-Whitney test, p &lt; 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A scattered lesion pattern on DWI in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and negative initial CT scan is associated with an embolic etiology and may indicate a favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
