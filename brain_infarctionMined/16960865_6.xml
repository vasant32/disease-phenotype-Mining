<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association between cerebral small-vessel disease, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and the risk and severity of mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to examine the effect of lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> on the risk and severity of MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is a cross-sectional community-based cohort study comprising 268 subjects, 65 to 83 years of age, residing in the Augsburg region of southern Germany, and without contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subcortical and periventricular WMLs, lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> determined using a standardized MRI protocol developed for the Rotterdam Scan Study and an established rating scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MPS, assessed in a standardized neurological examination and based on the Unified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's Disease</z:e> Rating Scale motor scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and large subcortical white matter lesions were associated with an elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002322'>resting tremor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> was related to an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002067'>bradykinesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a linear regression analysis relating each individual MRI measurement with the severity of MPS, the number of lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the degree of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002322'>resting tremor</z:hpo>, whereas the size of subcortical and periventricular WMLs was correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A higher degree of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was associated with increased severity of either cardinal sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our study, presence and volume of lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, cerebral WMLs, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> were associated with the risk as well as severity of MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Determining the presence of these brain changes using brain imaging might contribute to identify persons at risk for MPS </plain></SENT>
