<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Remote ischemic preconditioning is an emerging concept for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment, but its protection against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether remote preconditioning, performed in the ipsilateral hind limb, protects against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and explored its protective parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was generated by a permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) combined with a 30 min occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) in male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Limb preconditioning was generated by 5 or 15 min occlusion followed with the same period of reperfusion of the left hind femoral artery, and repeated for two or three cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> was measured 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that rapid preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min performed immediately before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size from 47.7+/-7.6% of control <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 9.8+/-8.6%; at two cycles of 15 min, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was reduced to 24.7+/-7.3%; at two cycles of 5 min, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min conducted 2 days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to 23.0+/-10.9%, but with two cycles of 15 min it offered no protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effects at these two therapeutic time windows of remote preconditioning are consistent with those of conventional preconditioning, in which the preconditioning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is induced in the brain itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, intermediate preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min performed 12 h before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to 24.7+/-4.7%, which contradicts the current dogma for therapeutic time windows for the conventional preconditioning that has no protection at this time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, remote preconditioning performed in one limb protected against ischemic damage after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
