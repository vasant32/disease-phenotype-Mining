<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the way in which <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-mediated TRPV1 modulation could attenuate damage in an experimental hypoxic-ischemic (HI) neonatal brain injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Rice-Vannucci method was used in 10-day-old rat pups by performing unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by 2 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% O2 at 37Â°C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi> was administered intraperitoneally (0.2 mg/kg or 2.0 mg/kg) at 3 h pre-HI or 1 h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post assessment included measurement of infarction volume at 24 and 72 h in addition to an assessment of the vascular dynamics of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) at 6 h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that pre-treatment with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> reduced infarction volume significantly with either low-dose or high-dose treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment also improved myogenic tone and decreased apoptotic changes in the distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> pre-treatment may provide neurovascular protection against neonatal HI </plain></SENT>
