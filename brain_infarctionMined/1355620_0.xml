<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The presence of known restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> A-I-C-III gene cluster, which encodes their respective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoproteins</z:chebi>, was investigated using the restriction enzymes Sac I and Pst I to determine the potential role of genetic variations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in an American population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-eight subjects (70 white, 28 black subjects), both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> believed at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, defined as showing stenosis focally or diffusely at that site, composed the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sac I polymorphic S2 allele frequency was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk groups, whereas Pst I polymorphic P2 allele frequency was similar in control and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher levels of serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (p less than 0.05) and significantly lower levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (p less than 0.05) were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk groups with diffuse stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of our study with the two racial groups show the following: the frequency of Sac I polymorphism was significantly higher in American black compared with American white subjects (chi 2 = 3.92, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were significantly higher in white compared with black subjects (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In white subjects, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was associated with significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>elevated total cholesterol</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (p less than 0.01) but not with Sac I polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In black subjects the converse was observed, namely, the Sac I polymorphic S2 allele seemed to be associated with carotid bifurcation stenosis but did not reach statistical significance because of the small number of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Sac I polymorphism did not correlate with any <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pst I polymorphism was not associated with any <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile or carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> identifies white subjects with increased plasma total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, an atherogenic profile, but not with Sac I polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that carotid bifurcation stenosis in white subjects is associated with an atherogenic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile but not with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> A-I-C-III restriction fragment length polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In black subjects, Sac I polymorphism seems to identify those individuals with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, a necessary precursor to atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but not those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>elevated total cholesterol</z:hpo>, elevated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and/or reduced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Sac I polymorphism may identify black subjects at increased risk for atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
