<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose: We assessed errors in cerebral blood flow (CBF) obtained from our proposed reference-based method without using arterial input function (AIF) indices in dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: We calculated CBF and the referential tissue-related ratio (CBFratio) using numerical simulation and 3 nondeconvolution methods and a deconvolution method of block-circulant singular value decomposition (cSVD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared errors with and without simulated noise as parameters of mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), AIF delay and temporal resolution, and clinical DSC-MRI maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: The errors in CBF obtained using maximum upslope (US) were smallest among the nondeconvolution methods and almost equivalent to errors in the cSVD method under practical imaging conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, errors in the CBFratio obtained using reference-based US (Ref-US) referring to white matter were smallest, even compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> errors in CBF and CBFratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ref-US method introduced less error than the cSVD method, especially at low flow rates, was further robust against AIF noise and coarse temporal resolution, and was comparably robust against transit delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In pixel-by-pixel correlations between absolute value maps for US and for cSVD-CBF in clinical DSC-MRI, those correlation coefficients (r) between the 2 maps were stable, r &gt; 0.9, despite variation in the slopes of the linear regression line, so the 2 CBFratio maps were visually well correlated in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The Ref-US technique without AIF measurement can become a practical perfusion methodology for DSC-MRI in patients even with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> because it balances robustness with systematic and random errors and it is simply performed </plain></SENT>
