<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical (CI) and subcortical (SI) brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (within 72 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) underwent transcranial Doppler and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> test (1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percent difference between blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was defined as VMR% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CI and SI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were confirmed by computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical status and disability were assessed by means of the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) respectively.VMR% values and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and disability parameters were compared between CI and SI groups using ANOVA and Pearson's correlation (r) coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VMR% values of the ipsilateral side to the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the CI group were significantly lower as compared with SI group (12.2+/-15.9% and 25.6+/-24.4% respectively, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VMR% values in both groups were not correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and disability (P&lt;0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest greater vulnerability of resistance arterioles in the setting of cortical gray matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although gray matter VMR is physiologically higher than white matter VMR, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CI have impaired cerebral vascular reserve </plain></SENT>
