<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>Protein C deficiency</z:hpo> leads to reduced inhibition of coagulation and an increased likelihood of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that the most common syndromes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and hereditary heterozygous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> who developed multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Patient 1 was a 46-year-old man with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who developed a right upper quadrantanopia and gradually progressive intellectual and behavioral deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 was a 61-year-old man with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and two episodes of right-sided motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> who developed left sixth and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>seventh cranial-nerve palsies</z:hpo> and reduced pinprick sensation in the right extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both patients, magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple small lesions in the pons as well as the bilateral basal ganglia, thalamus, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, and other subcortical structures, which are consistent with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein C activity and antigen levels were reduced to approximately one half of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in these two patients, as well as in some of their family members who had no other serological or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of heterozygous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> type 1 was thus established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although it remains uncertain whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> itself increases the risk of cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, it may predispose a patient to develop multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
