<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancrod is a potentially effective therapy because of the advantageous consequences of fibrinogen lowering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the safety and efficacy of ancrod in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> administered within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 64 patients received intravenous ancrod and 68 received placebo for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome, disability, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in overall mean scores on the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in the ancrod-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The target reduction of plasma fibrinogen levels of less than 100 mg/dL was achieved in only 15 (23%) of 64 ancrod-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those patients with ancrod-induced 6-hour fibrinogen levels 130 mg/dL or less had a marginally significantly better neurological outcome on the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, mortality, and Barthel Index than ancrod-treated patients with higher fibrinogen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ancrod appears safe and potentially effective when administered to patients within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
