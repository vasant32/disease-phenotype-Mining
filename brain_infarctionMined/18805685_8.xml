<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">Docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) is an essential <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system that has been shown to possess neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether different preadministrative protocols of DHA have effects on brain injury after focal cerebral I/R and investigated the potential neuroactive mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally pretreated with DHA once 1 h or 3 days being subjected to focal cerebral I/R or daily for 6 weeks before being subjected to focal cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three DHA-pretreated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of DHA on the treatment groups was accompanied by decreases in blood-brain barrier disruption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) production, inflammatory cell infiltration, interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression and caspase-3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevation of antioxidative capacity, as evidenced by decreased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level and increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> level, was detected only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily-administration group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two single-administration groups showed increased phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevation of Bcl-2 expression was detected in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> daily-administration and 3-day-administration groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro study demonstrated that DHA attenuated IL-6 production from stimulated glial cells involving nuclear factor kappaB inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the data suggest that the neuroprotective mechanisms of DHA pretreatment are, in part, mediated by attenuating damaging mechanisms through reduction of cytotoxic factor production and by strengthening survival mechanisms through ERK-mediated and/or Bcl-2-mediated prosurvival cascade </plain></SENT>
