<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because tissue response to ischaemic injury and to therapeutic intervention is tissue- and patient-dependent, changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> progression due to treatment may be better detected with voxel-based methods than with volumetric mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> DWI and PWI were combined using a generalized linear model (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GLM</z:e>) to predict infarction risk on a voxel-wise basis for patients treated either with non-thrombolytic (Group 1; n = 11) or with thrombolytic therapy (Group 2; n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predicted infarction risk for both groups was evaluated in four ipsilateral regions of interest: tissue acutely abnormal on DWI (Core), tissue acutely abnormal on PWI but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on DWI that either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (Recruited) or does not (Salvaged), and tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on both DWI and PWI that does not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath>) by follow-up imaging &gt; or = 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performance of the models was significantly reduced for the thrombolysed group compared with the group receiving standard treatment, suggesting an alteration in natural progression of the ischaemic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GLM</z:e>-predicted infarction risk values in the four regions were different from one another for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GLM</z:e>-predicted infarction risk in Salvaged tissue was significantly higher (P = 0.02) for thrombolysed patients than for non-thrombolysed patients, suggesting that thrombolysis rescued tissue with higher infarction risk than typically measured in tissue that spontaneously recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GLM</z:e>-predicted infarction risk values probably reflects the varying degrees of tissue injury and salvageability that exist after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI-based algorithms may therefore provide a more sensitive means for monitoring therapeutic effects on a voxel-wise basis </plain></SENT>
