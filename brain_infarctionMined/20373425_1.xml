<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare two data-driven methods of statistical image analysis, principal and independent component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, ICA), in identifying neural networks related to the transient occurrence of phosphenes experienced by a female patient subsequent to a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An initial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session consisted of two acquisitions: one of the patient experiencing phosphenes and a second responding to a well-defined visual stimulation paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second fMRI session 6 months later, when the patient no longer experienced phosphenes, consisted of an acquisition in which no stimulation was presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of correlations between the temporal expression coefficients and models of the hemodynamic response identified salient components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectral analysis confirmed the identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phosphene model was based solely on the subjective report of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both methods revealed occipital cortical and subcortical areas known to be sites for visual information-processing during stimulation, as did SPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, higher-order visual areas such as the precuneus and the lateral parietal cortex were implicated in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> of the phosphenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The analyses suggest the capability of data-driven approaches to identify the brain structures involved in these transient, spontaneous visual events </plain></SENT>
