<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 24) were studied in: (1) exercise (the animals run on a treadmill 30 min each day) for 3 weeks, (2) non-exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six animals from each group (n = 12) were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the remaining animals served as controls (n = 6 x 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were determined by Nissl staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral integrin expression was detected by immunochemistry and stereological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used flow cytometry to address the causal role of TNF-alpha in inducing the expression of integrins in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells under TNF-alpha or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exercise reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expressions of integrin subunit alpha(1), alpha(6), beta(1), and beta(4) were increased after exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise preconditioning reversed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-reduced integrin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An in vitro study revealed a causal link between the gradual upregulation of TNF-alpha (rather than VEGF) and cellular expression of integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated an increase in cerebral expression of integrins and a decrease in brain injury from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after exercise preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that upregulation of integrins during exercise enhances neurovascular integrity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The changes in integrins might be altered by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
