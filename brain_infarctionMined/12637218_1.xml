<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report a series of 9 infants with thrombotic events and the associated genetic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory records of newborns and infants with a history of thrombotic events were summarized, while patients with underlying diseases were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the genetic mutations was compared to a control group of 80 children from the same ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> was diagnosed and in 3 newborns, CT scan could diagnose antenatal brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another 2 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with femoral catheterization was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven infants were factor V Leiden heterozygous and another one homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">Methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase genotype was found in 5 infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five cases were found to be double heterozygous for those two mutations, and another one double heterozygous for FVL and factor II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this small series of patients indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> is the major thrombotic event in infants and the combination of more than one prothrombotic factors may be the cause of those events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correct management, including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, is still under discussion and waiting for larger series and long-term follow-up results until accurate recommendations can be made </plain></SENT>
