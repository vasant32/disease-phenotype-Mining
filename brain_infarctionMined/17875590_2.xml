<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomical and clinical relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and predict clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 28 pyramidal tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (&lt;3 days) with a marked motor deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anatomical location and the extent of CST involvement within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were visualized on three-dimensional colour-coded diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With regard to the CST, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were divided into three clinical subgroups: Group 1 (intact type), Group 2 (partial involvement type) and Group 3 (whole involvement type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the severity of the motor deficit of each patient was determined according to the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (&lt;3 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms), early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (8-14 days) and outcome (30-60 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NIHSS scores of Group 1 (12/28) were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (9/28) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase or early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase (U = -2.816, p&lt;0.01), and those of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3 (7/28) (U = -3.136, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At outcome,NIHSS scores of Group 1 were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (U = -2.846, p&lt;0.01), and scores of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3 (U = -3.130, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the NIHSS scores of each group gradually decreased from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase to outcome, Neurological improvement was statistically different among the three topographical types of infarction (H = 26.15, p&lt;0.01; H = 11.03, p&lt;0.01; H = 10.05, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the three-dimensional colour-coded DTT allows in vivo differentiation of distinct CST <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and may help in better establishing the prognosis for patients after CST <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
