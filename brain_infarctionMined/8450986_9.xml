<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features and causes of postoperative brainstem and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 10 group 1 patients had cardiac (eight) or aortic (two) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 12 group 2 patients had noncardiac-nonvascular surgery, including orthopedic (five), gynecologic (four), and general (three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were studied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> services at university hospitals in Boston (13), Charlottesville (three), Baltimore (three), and Mainz (three) during 2 consecutive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was immediately postoperative (six), during the first 48 postoperative hours (nine), and delayed 3 days or more (seven) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical syndromes were altered level of consciousness or cognition (15), vestibulocerebellar (four), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with focal brainstem signs (three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infarction involved the brainstem (13), cerebellum (13), and posterior cerebral artery hemispheric territory (10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Causes: In group 1, five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were due to cardiogenic embolism and three to embolism from the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had a postoperative pontine lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and one developed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the territory of a known stenotic basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group 2, one patient had vertebral artery injury from instrumentation, one had medical complications with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and 10 most likely had position-related vertebral artery thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with postoperative brainstem and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> present with altered consciousness or vestibulocerebellar syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The major cause of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> after cardiac surgery is embolism from the heart and aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The causes of infarction after general surgery are less clear, but neck positioning during or after surgery may play an important role by promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in compressed arteries that later embolize intracranially when neck motion becomes free </plain></SENT>
