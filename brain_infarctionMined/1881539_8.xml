<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For T1-weighted images, a repetition time (TR) of 500 ms and an echo time (TE) of 30 or 23 ms was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The corresponding times for T2-weighted images were TR 3000 ms and TE 120 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, less than 3 days old, were iso- to mildly hypointense on short TR/TE scans and markedly hypointense on long TR/TE scans (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the following four days the signal of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> became hyperintense on short TR/TE scans, beginning in the periphery and proceeding towards the center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On long TR/TE scans the signal remained markedly hypointense (early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>7-14 days old <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were of high signal intensity on short TR/TE scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On long TR/TE scans they appeared hypointense in the center and hyperintense in the periphery (late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By the end of the second week the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were of high signal intensity on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pulse sequences (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were surrounded by a parenchymal rim of hypointensity on long TR/TE scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>28 neonates and infants (with 11 follow-up examinations) of 31.5-70.6 weeks postconceptional age (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The etiologies of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were: asphyxia (17 cases), brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorder</z:e> (1) and unknown origin (7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> in neonates and infants with MRI at 2.35 Tesla using spine-cho sequences </plain></SENT>
