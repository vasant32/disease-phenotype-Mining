<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this polymorphism in relation to WMC in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, we prospectively observed 67 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and 134 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined using a nested polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WMC were measured quantitatively and were divided into two groups, severe and mild, with the mean volume of WMC as the cut point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (33%) had severe WMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the distribution of APOE epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 alleles between severe and mild WMC groups (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of epsilon4 alleles was higher in patients with severe WMC than in those with mild WMC (25% vs. 7%, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that APOE epsilon4 may exacerbate WMC in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
