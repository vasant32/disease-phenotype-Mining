<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Inhaled NO (INO), at 5-40 parts per million (ppm) in the air, is indicated for treating neonatal hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether these doses of INO are protective or toxic towards brain was here evaluated in laboratory animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In rat neonates (postnatal day 7), a brain injury based on permanent right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus transient (90 min) respiratory <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) was challenged by two NO dosages (10 and 40 ppm) given either before, during or after transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three weeks later, animal brains were studied for the loss of cerebral matter (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In right hemispheres, significant increases (26-39%) in lesion sizes were induced by 40 and not 10 ppm INO, whatever the inhalation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two doses reduced significantly the left hemisphere volume only when NO was inhaled at the re-oxygenation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that high doses of INO, brain damaging events and inhalation at re-oxygenation might affect brain integrity when these conditions are cumulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical relevance of this (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>) and previously described (haematomas) brain toxicity associated with INO remains to be clarified in the human neonates, for instance through non-invasive cerebral imagery follow-up of patients given INO </plain></SENT>
