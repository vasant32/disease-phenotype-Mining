<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in tau proteins are associated with a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, termed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tauopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether over-expressing human tau with P301L mutation also affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced brain damage, we performed <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (H/I) in young adult P301L tau transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was significantly smaller in transgenic mice compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice 24 h after H/I induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining also revealed less brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in transgenic mice following H/I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>H/I resulted in a significant increase in tau fragments generated by caspase activation and a marked decrease in tau phosphorylation at residue T231 in cortex of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> but not transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation of calpain and caspase-3 following H/I was also reduced in transgenic compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice, as reflected by lower levels of the specific spectrin breakdown products generated by calpain or caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, basal levels of the glial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter, GLT-1, were higher in brains of transgenic as compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the idea that enhanced levels of GLT-1 in transgenic mice are responsible for reducing H/I-induced brain damage by decreasing extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> accumulation and subsequent calpain and caspase activation </plain></SENT>
