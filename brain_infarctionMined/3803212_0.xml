<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common site was the area supplied by the posterior cerebral artery, usually ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experience so far indicates that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are most commonly caused by transient, dynamically produced occlusion of the artery, more rarely by venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, resulting from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the morbidity and mortality rate of patients with and without infarction after trauma with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> indicates that an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> clearly worsens prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> can be easily distinguished from contusional foci by CT, although both have decreased density, because the former spread within the supply area of a vessel and, similarly to embolic or arteriosclerotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, produce contrast enhancement after administration of contrast media as an expression of a disturbed blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
