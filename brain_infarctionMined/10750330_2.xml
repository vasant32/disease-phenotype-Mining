<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome in the placebo arm was much higher than expected possibly because patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s are likely to be included as progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subjects when a brief 3-6 hours duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is defined as the therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yonas' group at the University of Pittsburg demonstrated that adding stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> inhalation to routine CT scanning performed during emergency screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, predicted which cases became irreversibly infarcted if thrombolytic therapy was not administered within a few hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, since non-contrasted CT scans are usually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> this early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adding a few minutes for inhalation of 26% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> is justified in order to measure LCBF values which predict size, severity and volumes of impending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> and rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s which have relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT-CBF values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT-CBF measures provide positive indications for thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is not possible by MRI and SPECT methods which are not sufficiently quantitative to discern LCBF values persistently below ischemic thresholds of 16 mls/100 gm/min, thereby predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002965" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impending infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
