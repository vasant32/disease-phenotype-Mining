<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD), <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel abnormalities have been reported in both neural and peripheral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, using whole-cell patch-clamp, we demonstrate an aberrant <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-dependent modulation of K(V)1.3 channels in T lymphocytes of AD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although intrinsic K(V)1.3 properties in patients were similar to healthy individuals, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (1-1000 microM) failed to yield the hyperpolarizing shift normally observed in K(V)1.3 steady-state inactivation (-4.4+/-2.7 mV in AD vs. -14.3+/-2.5 mV in controls, 10 microM <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>), resulting in a 4-fold increase of resting channel activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> data indicate that this abnormality is due to dysfunction of cognate group II mGluRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> is present in plasma and that both mGluRs and K(V)1.3 channels regulate T-lymphocyte responsiveness, our finding may account for the presence of immune-associated alterations in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, if this aberration reflects a corresponding one in neural tissue, it could provide a potential target in AD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
