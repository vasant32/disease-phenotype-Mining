<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, cilostazol is inferior in tolerability for the adverse events than other anti-platelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether cilostazol escalation oral administration affects its tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight patients hospitalized for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with cilostazol treatment in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center from 2006 to 2008 were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this term, we had two teams in our center and used different regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of which used 100 mg b.i.d. regimen of cilostazol (Standard group) and the other used 50 mg b.i.d. for the initial 4 days, followed by a dose of 100 mg b.i.d. of it (Escalation group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient's information such as baseline characteristics, adverse events, were collected and statistically analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in Standard group and 87 patients in Escalation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison between these groups demonstrated that Escalation group had fewer patients who discontinued treatment (p=0.001) and a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This type of dose escalation regimen of cilostazol may be superior to the standard regimen in tolerability </plain></SENT>
