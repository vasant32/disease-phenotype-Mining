<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is tightly related to the resistance of cells to stress and injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the roles of TERT in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We try to investigate the effects of TERT on the function of astrocytes in developing rat brains subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TERT expression was detected in rat brains with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In in vitro study, the function of astrocytes with TERT overexpression was measured, and the effects of astrocyte on neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, overexpression or inhibition of TERT was conducted in vivo by gene transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte proliferation was examined through Ki67 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling staining and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume calculation were used to detect neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both TERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were upregulated in neurons within 2 days but shifted to astrocytes at Day 3 after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte proliferation was inhibited with TERT overexpression due to the upregulation of cell-cycle regulatory protein p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neurons increased, whereas neurons were cocultured with conditioned media from astrocytes with TERT inhibition compared with TERT overexpression due to the decrease of neurotrophin-3 expression in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Ki67-positive astrocytes and neuronal injury were found to be inhibited in TERT-overexpressing rat brains with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TERT attenuates astrocyte proliferation and promotes neuronal survival in the developing rat brain after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, partly through its enhancement of p15 and neurotrophin-3 expression in astrocytes </plain></SENT>
