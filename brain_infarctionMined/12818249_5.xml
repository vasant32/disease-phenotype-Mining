<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two major variants of the gene encoding the IIIa subunit, called PLA1 (A1) and PLA2 (A2), have been identified in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are indications that the A2 allele can also be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to study the distribution of the A2 allele in different vascular subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 638 consecutive patients were analyzed and classified as having large vessel pathology (n=168) or a small vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n=210) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Localization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> was deducted from analysis of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remainder patients were listed into a mixed vascular pathology group (n=167) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with other or poorly characterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology were excluded from the study (n=93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the small vessel and mixed vascular pathology groups, the PLA2 allele frequency was similar to that in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, PLA2 allele frequency was approximately two-fold higher in patients with large vessel pathology (23.3%) than in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free control subjects (11.7%, p&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis of data confirmed this association with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-4.9, p&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the PLA2 allele is more frequent in brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> associated with large-vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
