<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants comprised 50 children (26 males, 24 females; median age at presentation 3 y 4 mo, range 2 mo-16 y 10 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, symptoms resolved in less than 24 hours in 21 children (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> [<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>] group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven children saw a doctor within 6 hours of the attack; 32 did not see a paediatric neurologist until after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial neuroimaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) occurred in less than 6 hours in 13/46 children and in more than 24 hours in 18/46 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging occurred in more than 24 hours in 43/47 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to clinical diagnosis (data available on 42 children) was less than 6 hours in 14 children, 6 to 12 hours in six, 12 to 24 hours in eight, and more than 24 hours in 14 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were more likely to have shorter time to diagnosis than those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that most children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AIS are seen within 6 hours but definitive imaging and specialist assessment take more than 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time to diagnosis is significantly longer in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Trials of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment being designed for childhood AIS will require rapid transfer to tertiary centers and access to definitive neuroimaging, but these data suggest that this will challenge existing practice </plain></SENT>
