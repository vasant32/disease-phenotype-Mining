<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether, in well-functioning older adults, a lower score on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and slower gait are associated with greater risk of mortality and of developing incident disability independent of other risk factors, including brain structural abnormalities (white matter hyperintensities, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, ventricular enlargement) and whether the combination of varying levels of DSST score and gait speed are associated with a greater risk of mortality and disability than low DSST or slow gait alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand one hundred fifty-six (43% men, 29% black, mean age 70.4) participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and physical disability and with a modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) score of 80 or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Total mortality and incident disability (self-report of any difficulty performing one or more of the six activities of daily living) ascertained over a median follow-up time of 8.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the end of follow-up, 704 participants had died and 1,096 had incident disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, lower DSST score and slower gait remained significantly associated with greater risk of mortality and of incident disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates were higher in those who had both low DSST score (&lt;27 points) and slow gait (speed &lt;1.0 m/s) than in those who had only low DSST score, only slow gait, or neither (rates per 1,000 person years (p-y): 61.2, 42.8, 20.8, and 16.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar risk gradient was observed for incident disability (82.0, 57.9, 47.9, and 36.0/1,000 p-y, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In well-functioning older adults, low DSST score and slow gait, alone or in combination, could be risk factors for mortality and for developing disability, independent of other risk factors, including measures of brain integrity </plain></SENT>
