<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: From 1992 to 1995, we evaluated 998 very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> infants of which 111 developed cerebral white matter lesions on cranial ultrasonogram examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An attempt was made to differentiate the lesions into either PHVI or PVL using specific ultrasonographic criteria (Volpe JJ </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients who survived to discharge constituted the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survivors were followed prospectively with neurologic examinations, visual and auditory screening, and developmental testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PHVI was diagnosed in 23 patients (30%), PVL in 36 (47%), characteristics of both PHVI and PVL (mixed lesions) in 8 (11%), and persistent periventricular echodensity without cystic change in 9 (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-year follow-up data were obtained on 57 of 76 (75%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurodevelopmental deficits were common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups; however, infants with localized PHVI had a mean developmental quotient in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The majority of white matter lesions (77%) can be differentiated as either PHVI or PVL by ultrasonographic criteria, with coexisting features in only 11% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to these lesions, persistent periventricular echodensity was also associated with a high risk of subsequent neurodevelopmental deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development was seen in a subgroup of patients with localized periventricular hemorrhagic venous infarction </plain></SENT>
