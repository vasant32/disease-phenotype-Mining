<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at assessing whether controlled and steady heparinemia in plasma can reduce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and exert neuroprotective effects after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volume was measured at 24 and 7 days following a 1-hr intraluminal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in rats treated with UH or with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After testing several UH administration protocols, we choose to give a bolus of 200 U/kg, which was started 3 hr after the occlusion, followed by a 24-hr intraperitoneal perfusion of 70 U/kg/hr, which maintained a 24-hr steady plasma heparinemia (0.3-0.6 U/ml) and caused no <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> or systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma IL-10 concentration was measured by ELISA, endothelial VCAM-1 expression was evaluated by i.v. injection of a (125)I-labeled monoclonal antibody against VCAM-1, and brain hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression was determined by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UH-treated rats showed smaller infarctions than rats treated with vehicle, as well as higher IL-10 plasma levels and HO-1 brain expression and lower endothelial VCAM-1 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study shows that a stable plasma concentration of UH given at nonhemorrhagic doses reduces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also shows that UH prevented the induction of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the cerebral vasculature and increased the expression of molecules with antiinflammatory and prosurvival properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support further testing of the clinical value of parenteral, adjusted, high-dose UH in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
