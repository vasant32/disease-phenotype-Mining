<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aetiological role of common genetic mutations was analysed in a subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 406 patients were examined because of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a detailed clinical scrutiny, 5 were found who did not exhibit any of the classical clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this clinically homogeneous subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, the prothrombin A20210G, Hong Kong, Cambridge and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase C677T (MTHFR C677T) mutations, angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism (ACE polymorphism) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi> E) genotype were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients, the same type of clustering of three mutations was manifested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous Leiden V mutation was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 subjects, while a heterozygous MTHFR C677T mutation and an I/D genotype for ACE polymorphism were detected in 4 of them, and a homozygous D/D genotype and a homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This type of clustering of the mutations was not observed in the remaining 401 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the Leiden mutation might possibly be an aetiological factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a rare subgroup of patients who do not display any of the classical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The roles of ACE D polymorphism and the MTHFR C677T mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, should also be taken into consideration in this subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These unfavourable genetic factors might be aetiological factors if they are clustered together in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient not presenting any of the standard clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
