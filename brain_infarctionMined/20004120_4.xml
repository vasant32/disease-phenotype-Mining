<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES/DESIGN: In symptomatic patients treated with ipsilateral carotid artery stenting (CAS) plus intensive <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering, we assessed the changes of osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and the Gray-Scale Median (GSM) score contralateral to symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS/METHODS: Forty-six symptomatic patients (group A) with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET): &gt;70%) underwent ipsilateral CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those patients had simultaneously contralateral low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (NASCET: 30-69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B included 67 symptomatic patients with low-grade bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (NASCET: 30-69%), but without indications for revascularisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (10-80mg) to target <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>)&lt;100mgdl(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples and plaques' GSM score contralateral to brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were assayed at baseline and after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences between groups (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six-month <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment equivalently improved <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in both groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The parameters hsCRP, OPN and OPG were significantly down-regulated within both groups, but to a greater extent in group A (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides this, contralateral GSM score was significantly improved from baseline in both groups (p&lt;0.01), but that increment was more pronounced in group A (vs. group B; p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes were inversely correlated with changes in OPN (p=0.014), OPG (p=0.011) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral CAS plus intensive <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering therapy was associated with enhanced contralateral carotid plaque stability and attenuated inflammatory burden and calcification inhibitors to a greater extent than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> therapy alone in patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
