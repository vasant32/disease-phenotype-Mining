<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Seventy-four juvenile female pigs underwent a 75-min period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> at 20 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A microdialysis catheter was placed into the cortex gray matter and brain extracellular concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were measured throughout the experiment by enzymatic methods using a microdialysis analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surviving animals were sacrificed on the 7th postoperative day and histopathological examination of the brain was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were higher in animals that survived (p = 0.017), especially from the 90-min until the 7-h interval after the start of rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blood venous concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were also higher among survivors, and correlated significantly with the brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels at 2-h and 4-h intervals after the start of rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher concentrations of brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were observed throughout the study among animals that died postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly, negatively correlated with brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratio was significantly lower among survivors during the postoperative period (p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations were higher and brain <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> concentrations lower among the animals that did not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but such differences did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral microdialysis is a useful tool for cerebral monitoring during experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and high brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ratios after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> are strong predictors of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations are negatively correlated with brain <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
