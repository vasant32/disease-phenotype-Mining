<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> (SBIs), leukoaraiosis (LA), and microbleeds (MBs) are ischaemic silent radiologic abnormalities that act as predictors of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the independent effect of silent radiologic abnormalities on initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of patients who had their first ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 72 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected on admission, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the ischaemic lesion, SBI, LA, and MB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factors potentially associated with lower initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (admission NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale 0-5) and good short-term outcome (discharge NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale 0-5, modified Rankin Scale 0-1) were validated by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> were noted in 82 (45%) of the 182 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there were no statistically significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes and lesion location, univariate analysis revealed that patients with SBI had reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (P = 0.005) and infarction volume (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for covariates, the presence of SBI was independently associated with lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and good short-term outcome when the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale was used as dependent variable (OR 3.368, 95% CI 1.361-8.332, P = 0.009; OR 3.459, 95% CI 1.227-9.755, P = 0.019, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of SBI lost significance when the discharge-modified Rankin Scale was used as dependent variable (P = 0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Amongst silent radiologic abnormalities, SBI was the only predictor of reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> deserves more attention in evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
