<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because nearly one third of patients remain with unknown etiology after a complete screening workup, we aim to investigate whether molecular markers of myocardial damage were associated with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and if they were useful to reclassify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 262 patients with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within the first 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtype was evaluated by TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined origin were reclassified into likely atherothrombotic or likely cardioembolic according to a predefined non-validated algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained on admission to determine serum levels of molecular markers (pro-BNP, pro-ANP and CK-MB) of myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with cardioembolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> showed higher levels of pro-BNP, pro-ANP and CK-MB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pro-BNP &gt; 360 pg/mL was independently associated with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR: 28.51, CI95%: 5.90-136.75, p&lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> etiology was undetermined in 82 patients (31%); 34 were reclassified as likely cardioembolic, 22 as likely atherothrombotic, and 26 remained as undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pro-BNP &gt; 360 pg/mL was the only factor independently associated with likely cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pro-BNP levels higher than 360 pg/mL are associated with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may be useful to reclassify undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> as of cardioembolic origin </plain></SENT>
