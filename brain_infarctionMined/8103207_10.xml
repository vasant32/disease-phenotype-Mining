<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local blood flow and CPS were measured by double tracer autoradiography, and local ATP content by bioluminescence imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In untreated animals breakdown of energy metabolism occurred at flow values below 15 +/- 1 and CPS inhibition below 51 +/- 15 ml/100 g/min (means +/- S.D.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MK-801 treatment (3 mg/kg immediately after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion) did not change the ischemic flow threshold of energy failure (16 +/- 3 ml/100 g/min) but lead to a highly significant decline of the perfusion threshold for the inhibition of CPS to 19 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that MK-801 dramatically reduces the threshold for the suppression of protein synthesis which could explain previously reported therapeutical effects on the reduction of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
