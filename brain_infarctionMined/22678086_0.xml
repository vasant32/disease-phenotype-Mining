<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of the absence of T cell subsets on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and then used an in vitro coculture system of splenocytes and neurons to further identify the roles of T cell subsets in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was induced by middle cerebral artery suture occlusion in mice and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes were measured 2 days poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Splenocytes were cocultured with neurons, and neuronal survival was measured 3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A deficiency of both T and B cells (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo>) and the paucity of CD4 or CD8 T cells equally resulted in smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes as measured 2 days poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a functional deficiency of regulatory T cells had no effect, impaired Th1 immunity reduced infarction and impaired Th2 immunity aggravated brain injury, which may be due to an inhibited and enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in mice deficient in Th1 and Th2 immunity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro coculture system, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> splenocytes resulted in dose-dependent neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurotoxicity of splenocytes from these immunodeficient mice was consistent with their effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in vivo, except for the mice with the paucity of CD4 or CD8 T cells, which did not alter the ratio of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T cell subsets play critical roles in brain injury induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detrimental versus beneficial effects of Th1 cells and Th2 cells both in vivo and in vitro reveal differential therapeutic target strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
