<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decompressive craniectomy involves opening of the dura mater to give more space for the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review describes hemicraniectomy and discusses its usefulness, especially in massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature up to January 2007 was retrieved from Medline with the terms "hemicraniectomy" and "decompressive craniotomy" in combination with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>" and "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>39 studies were found of patients operated with decompressive craniotomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the period 1990-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Hemicraniectomy for massive supratentorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> has been insufficiently documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemicraniectomy performed within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> has recently been compared to medical management alone in three randomized studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pooled analysis of patients (93 patients aged &lt; 60 years) with massive infarction in the arteria cerebral media territory, indicated a significantly lower one-year mortality and a significantly larger proportion with a one-year outcome of mRS &lt;3 after hemicraniectomy than after medical management alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following key questions still need to be answered: surgical timing, the relevance of hemispheric dominance, the extension of infarcted brain, and whether the reduced mortality justifies the morbidity among survivors (particularly in older age groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even though increased survival has now been documented, the decision to perform hemicraniectomy in patients with massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> must still be made on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
