<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The PON1 activity, ARE and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were determined in 37 patients and 53 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 37 patients (20 males and 17 females) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of PON1 activity in patients and healthy individuals were 63.5±46.7IU/L and 95.5±75.5IU/L, respectively (p=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same values for ARE were 54.3±19.3KU/L for patients and 69.1±29.3KU/L for controls (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism in Q192R location shows statistically different presentation in patient group compared to healthy controls with an odds ratio of 3.42 (CI 95%: 1.24-9.44, p=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, we suggest that PON1 192R polymorphism may play a minor role as a risk marker for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> in a group of Iranian population </plain></SENT>
