<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in iNOS expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterin</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their common carotid arteries were clamped during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then they were resuscitated with 30% oxygen (HI group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Piglets of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group were treated as the HI group and their body was cooled to 35.5 degrees C after hypoxic-ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sham-treated piglets were also reserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the HI group, iNOS was present in neurons and macrophages of the cerebral cortex 12h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate were elevated in the cerebral cortex 12h after hypoxic-ischemic insults but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterin</z:chebi> level was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterin</z:chebi> concentration after the insult (377.9+/-78.7 nM) was five times higher than before the insult (80.1+/-4.3 nM); this level peaked 4h after the insult (604.8+/-200.9 nM) and only slightly decreased after 12h (445.9+/-57.8 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group, no iNOS expression was observed 12h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15373">biopterin</z:chebi> concentration after the insult (464.2+/-92.3 nM) was similar to that in the HI group, but was suppressed by 4h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (229.3+/-106.8 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study, neuronal iNOS expression and increase of NO production were found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
