<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> is proved to elicit a vanity of biological effects through its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But the mechanisms underlying are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) coordinates expression of genes required for free radical scavenging, detoxification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi>, and maintenance of redox potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the time course expression regularity of Nrf2, HO-1 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>'s role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and its potential mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, 6 time points was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiment 2 was used to detect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>'s neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24 h neurological deficit was evaluated using a modified six point scale; brain water content was measured; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was analysed with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, Western blot, and confocal microscope were used to analyse the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with sham-operated, Nrf2 and HO-1 were upregulated at gene and protein level in ischemic brain, beginning at 3 h and peaking at 24 h after MCAO (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> high dose (100 mg/kg) upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 in MCAO-affected brain tissue and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (P&lt;0.05), brain water content (P&lt;0.05) and behavioral deficits (P&lt;0.05) caused by MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nrf2 and HO-1 were induced at the early stage after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO, this effect may be through upregulation of the transcription factor Nrf2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nrf2 may be one of the strategic targets for cerebral ischemic therapies </plain></SENT>
