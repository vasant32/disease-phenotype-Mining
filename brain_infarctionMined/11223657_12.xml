<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Repeat studies in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> can be compared to incidental studies in the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in order to shed light on the development of changes causing ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or recovery of critically perfused tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) studies of regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral metabolic rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> (FMZ) binding in the cat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) model and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After permanent MCAO, the development of "misery-perfused" penumbral tissue and its centrifugal conversion into <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> could be demonstrated, resembling focal pathophysiological changes in patients with ischemic attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the experimental model and in vascular insults in humans, a chance of recovery existed if collateral perfusion developed spontaneously within the first hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In transient MCAO, reperfusion was only effective in preventing infarction when it was initiated as long as misery perfusion persisted; in these cases tissue was salvaged and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> did not develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other instances when oxygen metabolism broke down, and an increased OEF was no longer seen, reperfusion even at levels above preocclusion had no effect, and large space-occupying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experimental findings are comparable to the variable outcome after thrombolytic therapy; if reperfusion is achieved within the therapeutic window of tissue viability, large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are prevented and complete or partial recovery can be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the experimental model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, FMZ can be utilized as a marker of neuronal integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If FMZ binding in the cortex is decreased below 4 times the mean value of white matter in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, permanent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed on late CT/MRI; this irreversible damage could not be prevented by thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that PET studies in suitable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models in cats can help to explain various courses and diverging outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
