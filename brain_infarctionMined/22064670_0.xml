<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in the inner ear function and the vestibular neural pathway according to the progression of a labyrinthine infarction in a patient with an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 58-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who presented with isolated inner ear symptoms similar to those of endolymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> but finally progressed to an AICA infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Serial neurotologic testing according to progression to an AICA infarction and antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiologic findings and neurotologic parameters, including pure tone audiogram thresholds, spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, summating potentials/action potentials on electrocochleography, interaural amplitude difference on the vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test, canal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> and fixation index on the bithermal caloric test, and gain on oculomotor tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our patient initially presented with sudden hearing loss and was diagnosed with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AICA infarction on a follow up MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynamic change in neurotologic testing was observed during disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and motion intolerance improved gradually after antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Changes in the clinical profile, which were documented during a transition from isolated labyrinthine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to an AICA infarction, suggest that sensitivity to an ischemic injury is variable in different components of the labyrinthine organs in addition to providing a new insight into the response of vestibular neural pathway to ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
