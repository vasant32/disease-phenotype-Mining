<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of serum cholesterol with silent brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (SBIs) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between SBI and various clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included 324 apparently healthy Japanese men (mean age 53.8+/-9.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combinations of three types of scan (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR images) were used to detect and discriminate SBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum cholesterol was significantly associated with SBI [total cholesterol, odds ratio (OR) 3.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-9.68); <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.03-6.27), and non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.03-6.27)] after adjustment for age, smoking status, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, maximal-intima-media thickness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agent use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our cross-sectional data suggest that serum cholesterol levels are associated with SBI independently of known confounders </plain></SENT>
