<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Hyperintensity along the ipsilateral cortical spinal tract (CST) on a diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has been reported to may be associated with motor disability after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and can be misdiagnosed as a new infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying patho-<z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> related to this finding is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to analyze the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in patients with this hyperintensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients (50 Â± 10 years) who exhibited hyperintensity on DWI along ipsilateral CST from 3 to 21 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were reviewed as positive group, including 5 patients with serial DTI examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients without hyperintensity during the matched examination time were classified as reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), fractional anisotropy (FA), and eigenvalues and their ratios (ipsilateral/contralateral value) in cerebral peduncle were measured, their correlation with motor function scale at eight months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serial examinations showed that hyperintensity could eventually disappear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and FA values were significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) compared to the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral FA significantly correlated with motor function scale in both groups (r = 0.875, 0.738; p = 0.004, 0.006 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The hyperintensity on DWI is a transient <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> of Wallerian degeneration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, its diffusion characteristics include concurrent significant decrease of ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral FA value has the potential to predict neurological motor function outcome in such patients </plain></SENT>
