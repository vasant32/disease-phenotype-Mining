<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (15 men and 5 women) already had documented atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> other than ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> at the time of the hospital admission (atherosclerotic group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When both sexes were considered together, mortality during the 4-year follow-up was significantly higher in the atherosclerotic group than in the non-atherosclerotic group (6/20 versus 3/34; p less than 0.05) and this was due to an excess of cerebrovascular mortality (4/20 versus 0/34; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of recurrent fatal or non-fatal ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was significantly higher in the atherosclerotic group than in the non-atherosclerotic group (8/20 versus 3/34; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those patients who survived the 4-year follow-up period the incidence of new non-fatal atherosclerotic vascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo>) was significantly higher in the atherosclerotic group than in the non-atherosclerotic group (8/14 versus 8/31; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded, that the presence of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> at the time of first ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in patients under the age of 65 is associated with a significantly increased risk for recurrent ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> or other new atherosclerotic vascular events </plain></SENT>
