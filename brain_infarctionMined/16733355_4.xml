<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 15,815 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> registered in the Japan Multicenter <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Investigators' Collaboration (J-MUSIC) registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group included 694 (4.4%) patients and the out-of-hospital group included 15,121 (95.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) was more common in the in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group (34.6%) than in the out-of-hospital group (20.4%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The admission NIHSS score (median, in-hospital 13 vs. out-of-hospital 5, p &lt; 0.0001) and the mortality rate at discharge were higher in the in-hospital group than in the out-of-hospital group (in-hospital 19.2% vs. out-of-hospital 6.8%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate logistic regression analyses, female gender (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.3), older age (OR 1.0, 95% CI 1.02-1.03), AF (OR 4.4, 95% CI 4.0-4.8), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4) and in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (OR 3.3, 95 %CI 2.7-3.9) were independent factors associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (NIHSS score &gt; or =11), and older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04), the presence of AF (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.0-1.5), in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02) and NIHSS score at initial evaluation (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.14-1.17) were independent factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits in patients with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were severer and the outcome was worse than in those with out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a strategy to reduce in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> should be implemented </plain></SENT>
