<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated the motor recovery mechanism of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient using functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor image tractography (DTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 60 year-old woman with right <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> presented with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of the left upper extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The motor function of the affected upper extremity recovered slowly for 6 months to a point of nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The motor function of the patient was evaluated by fMRI and DTT at 6 months from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FMRI was performed at 1.5 T with timed hand grasp-release movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DTT was performed using 1.5 T with a synergy-L Sensitivity Encoding head coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three dimensional reconstructions of the fiber tracts were obtained with FA &lt; 0.3, angle &gt; 45 degrees as termination criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) was activated during both affected (left) and unaffected hand movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DTT showed that the tracts originated from either SM1; the tracts then descended along the known pathway of the corticospinal tract, with the exception that the tract of the affected (right) hemisphere descended along the posterior portion of the infarcted <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the motor function of the affected upper extremity was reorganized to the posterior portion of the infarcted <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding may reflect functional reorganization of the motor pathway following corticospinal tract damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This appears to be one motor recovery mechanism of subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
