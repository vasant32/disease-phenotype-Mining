<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1, 1978, through Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>31, 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients (37 men, 17 women; mean age 63 years) who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with contralateral carotid occlusion (group I) were compared with 410 demographically similar patients without contralateral carotid occlusion (group II) who underwent 503 CEAs during the same interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CEA indications in group I were the following and were proportionately similar to those of group II: hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, 22 patients; asymptomatic stenosis, 12 patients; nonhemispheric symptoms, 11 patients; previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, eight patients; and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia, routine intraluminal shunting, systemic heparinization, and arteriotomy closure without patch were routinely employed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients in group I suffered permanent neurologic deficits after operation (5.6%) and two had transient postoperative deficits with complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (2.0%) in group II suffered permanent neurologic deficits and 10 patients experienced transient neurologic events after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither the transient nor the permanent neurologic deficit rates were statistically different (p greater than 0.05; Fisher exact test) in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality rates for group I and group II were 0% and 0.8%, respectively, and were not significantly different (p greater than 0.10; Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late postoperative ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> occurred in two patients in group I (3.8%) and in 13 patients (3.6%) in group II (p greater than 0.10; Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were virtually identical in both groups, with the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> caused by cardiac occlusion may undergo CEA with morbidity and mortality rates similar to those without contralateral occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Contralateral carotid occlusion does not necessarily portend an unfavorable early or late prognosis after CEA </plain></SENT>
