<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This entity has been investigated very rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: HE staining method observed the changes of cerebellar cortex after MCAO operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electron Microscopy and TUNEL methods observed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neural cells of cerebellar cortex after MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses method observed the caspase-3 in neural cells of cerebellar cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of HE staining indicated that no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> changes of cerebellar cortex tissue were observed after MCAO operation by HE staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further experiments by Electron Microscopy and TUNEL assay revealed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neural cells of cerebellar cortex were induced after MCAO in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses showed that caspase-3 played an important role on MCAO-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neural cells of cerebellar cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data showed for the first time that the role of caspase-3 in the mechanism of secondary injury of separated infarction in cerebellar cortex after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats and it might give a new treatment strategy for individuals with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
