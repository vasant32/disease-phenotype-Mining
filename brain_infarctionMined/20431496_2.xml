<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effects of embryonic stem cell transplantation on brain damage were investigated by using a photochemically induced thrombotic brain damage model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice with systemic transplantation of embryonic stem cells expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein on day 1 showed a smaller brain lesion size on day 8 than the control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The smaller lesion was accompanied by the increase in the number of microvessels at the border of the damaged area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inside and around the damaged lesion, no EGFP-positive cells were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that embryonic stem cell transplantation reduced the brain lesion through the acceleration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> by endogenous endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
