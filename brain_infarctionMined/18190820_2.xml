<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied whether some variables differ between patients with right and left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 383 cases were obtained from our department-based records between April 2003 and March 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age distribution, sex, intracranial localization of anterior (carotid artery distribution) or posterior (vertebrobasilar artery distribution) circulation, mechanism subtypes according to Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) criteria, cerebrovascular risk factors, and time from clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to admission were analyzed between the right and the left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 200 patients had left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 183 patients had right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, vascular risk profile, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, and mechanism subtypes were not statistically different between patients with right- and left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time interval from neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to admission within 6 hours was significantly associated with left hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with left-sided small-vessel occlusion visited our hospital earlier, up to 6 hours as compared with patients with right-sided small-vessel occlusion (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suppose that patients with right-sided small-vessel occlusion may take time to be aware of neurologic deficits because of nondominant language or hand function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that different medical attention exists between patients with right and left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We should pay more attention to the difficulty in recognizing the neurologic deficits in patients with right hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, so that those patients delay hospital visit </plain></SENT>
