<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study set out to determine the prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI) in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial carried out in a tertiary-care academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The trial included participants from a randomized controlled trial of fibrinolytic therapy (FT) in patients with left-sided prosthetic valve <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (PVT), who had undergone pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SBI in this population was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was present in 27 of 72 patients (37.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.2, 49.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients with SBI (57; 82.6%) had sub-therapeutic anticoagulation at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified baseline characteristics that were associated with the presence of SBI using a logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) was strongly associated with the presence of SBI (odds ratio [OR] 5.60; 95% CI 1.32, 23.87; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of SBI among this cohort of young patients with mechanical heart valves is alarming and calls for urgent efforts to improve the quality of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered in the US National Institutes of Health registry at http://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00232622 </plain></SENT>
