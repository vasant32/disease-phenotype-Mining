<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The admission and 6-mo scores correlated with clinical conditions at each time </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months after the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the flow defect had decreased in 9 of 15 patients in whom three serial scans were available, with better clinical improvement than in the remaining six whose flow deficits increased </plain></SENT>
