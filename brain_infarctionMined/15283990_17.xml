<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4-weeks old) were divided into two groups and received either a regular diet (RD) or a fish-oil-supplemented diet (FOD) for 6 weeks prior to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume of the brain was calculated using image analysis after staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes were measured before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (BI), after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (AI) and after 24 h (24hR), 48 h (48hR) and after 7 days (7dR) of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infarction volume of the brain was significantly smaller in the FOD group than in the RD group after 24 h of reperfusion (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx) activity were higher in the FOD group than in the RD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, the catalase (CAT) activity in the FOD group remained at the preischemia level until after 48 h of reperfusion, while those in the RD group did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Mn-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activity and GPx activity were higher in the FOD group than in the RD group only after 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the fatty acid analysis, the ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) were higher in the FOD group than in the RD group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that supplementing the diet with fish oil could decrease the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> volume following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) partly by working directly as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and partly by modulating <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
