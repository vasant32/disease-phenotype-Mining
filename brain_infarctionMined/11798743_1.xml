<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the examinations mentioned-above were performed on 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to NASCET, EICA stenosis were classified into four grades: mild (the diameter reduction &lt; 30%), moderate (31% approximately 69%), severe (70% approximately 99%), and total occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One (3.1%) patient suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> after DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To compare duplex with DSA, Kappa = 0.78, and by the use of a severe or a greater than 30% stenosis as a positive study, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 78%, 95%, 92% and 97%, 91%, 94%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To compare MRA with DSA, Kappa = 0.73, and with the same criteria, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 78%, 90%, 89% and 97%, 91%, 94%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the evaluation where the results of duplex and MRA were in agreement, to compare duplex + MRA with DSA, Kappa = 0.93, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the diagnosis of severe stenosis were 100%, 95% and 96%, and the accuracy in the diagnosis of &gt; 30% stenosis was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is good correlativity between duplex scanning, MRA and DSA in the examination of EICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combination of duplex and MRA with their results in agreement may ultimately eliminate the need of DSA in the evaluation of EICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
