<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The genotypes of CBS 844ins68, MS A2756G and MTHFR C677T were determined by PCR-based assay in 102 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, 73 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 100 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalences of CBS 844ins68 and MS A2756G in the cohort studied were somewhat lower than that in western Caucasian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the frequencies of CBS 844ins 68, MS A2756G and MTHFR C677T mutations between the patient the and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the heterozygous form of CBS 844ins 68 tended to be more prevalent in the controls than in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gene mutations as CBS 844ins 68, MS A2756G and MTHFR C677T may not be independent risk factors for ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in Southern Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of CBS 844ins 68 and MS A2756G may vary with different ethnic groups or geographic regions </plain></SENT>
