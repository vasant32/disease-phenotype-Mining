<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Valve surgery for active infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) can cause fatal brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our current study aimed to evaluate the incidence of septic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> in active IE patients by performing preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including T(2)*- weighted sequences and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before urgent valve surgery, and to investigate whether such preoperative evaluation affects postoperative outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients were referred to our department for native valve IE during 2006-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urgent surgery was indicated in cases of hemodynamic failure resulting from valve destruction, refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and mobile vegetations measuring &gt;10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these patients, we performed preoperative MRI and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Males comprised 67% of the subjects, with average age 53 Â± 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 patients, urgent surgery was indicated in 15; of these, 10 (67%) showed a brain lesion related to IE: 6 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e>, 2 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, and 2 patients had hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and so did not undergo urgent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, 13 patients underwent urgent valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 5 patients who did not undergo urgent surgery, 4 patients later underwent valve surgery for healed IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or neurological complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI of patients with active IE revealed a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> caused by IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of MRI to detect septic embolism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> may provide important information for better surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
