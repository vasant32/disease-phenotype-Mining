<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) confers an increased risk for major cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still uncertain whether there is an association between LVH and asymptomatic cerebrovascular damage in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the relation between LVH, evaluated by both echocardiography (Echo-LVH) and electrocardiography (ECG-LVH), and preclinical cerebral damage, as identified by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred ninety-five consecutive patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated other risk factors such as age, sex, presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cholesterol levels, smoking status, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic cerebrovascular damage was considered silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e>: punctate lesions, lacunes, and territorial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 groups of patients differed only in terms of age and systolic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the prevalence of Echo-LVH (83% versus 47.7%, P&lt;0.001) and ECG-LVH (56% versus 22%, P&lt;0.001) was significantly higher in patients with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis allowed us to recognize LVH as the only independent predictor for the presence of ischemic lacunes (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we evaluated the impact of left ventricular geometry on asymptomatic cerebrovascular damage, and we found that hypertensives with concentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> displayed more pronounced asymptomatic cerebrovascular damage compared with patients with eccentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that LVH is associated with cerebral damage even in the absence of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of cardiac damage provides important prognostic clues about the presence of asymptomatic cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
