<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the significance of the location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in poststroke <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (PSF) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the association between BG <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 334 Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> consecutively admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit of a university-affiliated regional hospital in Hong Kong participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At admission, a host of demographic and clinical characteristics was collected and the number and location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were evaluated with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were assessed for PSF with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> severity scale (FSS) 3 months after their index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PSF was defined as a mean FSS score of 4.0 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were measured by the geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale (GDS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight (23.4%) patients had PSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, the PSF group included more females, had higher GDS scores, and a higher number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and the PSF patients were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at the BG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> BG <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> remained an independent predictor of PSF in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that BG <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may play a role in the development of PSF </plain></SENT>
