<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of repeat resection in the multimodal treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repeat surgery theoretically carries a higher risk of inducing neurological deficits, which might even out any advantage of cytoreduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether the occurrence of perioperative infarction is higher for repeat surgery than for first surgery, and sought to identify factors associated with the occurrence of postoperative infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we searched our database to identify patients who were operated for primary or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017638" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">glial tumors</z:e> between October 2007 and October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 177 procedures, of which 130 (73.4%) were first surgeries and 47 (26.5%) were repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial WHO grades, KPS scores, and age were evenly distributed between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six (26.0%) patients had new DWI lesions on their postoperative MRI scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (10.2%) patients had new lesions greater than 4 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these were 11 (6.2%) patients, for whom the new lesion caused neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between first and repeat surgery with regard to the occurrence of new DWI lesions (27.7 vs. 21.3%, P = 0.77) or neurological deficits (10.0 vs. 10.6%, P = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> location in the insula, operculum, and temporal lobe was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of new DWI lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that repeat surgery should not be withheld as a treatment option for patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo> for fear of a higher risk of postoperative infarction or new neurologic deficit than the first surgery </plain></SENT>
