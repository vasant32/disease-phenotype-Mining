<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to identify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of SSSI by comparing the characteristics and imaging features according to lesion location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 203 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SSSIs (diameter ≤20 mm) demonstrated by diffusion-weighted imaging in the perforator territory of the middle cerebral artery, basilar artery, or vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the 203 patients according to the lesion location in relation to the parent artery into a distal infarction (dSSSI) group and a proximal infarction (pSSSI) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated and compared the imaging features and clinical characteristics between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The evaluated characteristics included indicators of lipohyalinosis [leukoaraiosis and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (SBI)], indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> [parent artery disease (PAD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of other cerebral arteries (AOCA)], lesion size, and some vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between the two groups, the pSSSI group had larger lesion size, higher prevalence of PAD and AOCA, and greater frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, while the dSSSI group had smaller lesion size, higher prevalence of leukoaraiosis and SBI, and lower serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diversity of the SSSIs in imaging features and clinical characteristics according to lesion location suggests the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of SSSIs; distal infarction is closely associated with lipohyalinosis, while proximal infarction seems to be related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
