<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, there has been increasing interest in treating intraocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> with systemic chemotherapy combined with focal laser therapy and cryotherapy instead of radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a system of selective ophthalmic arterial infusion (SOAI) therapy, administering melphalan, the agent which had the greatest effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> in a clonogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SOAI system consists of a combination of a micro-balloon, a guiding catheter, and a flushing hub </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After selective catheterization to the cervical segment of the internal carotid artery by the guiding catheter, the micro-balloon was propelled to the portion just distal to the orifice of the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery, melphalan was infused from the introduced catheter tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We treated 187 patients with intraocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> with SOAI; 563 SOAIs were performed for 610 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 97.51% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen examinations failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant complication due to catheterization (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SOAI, using the balloon occlusion technique, is safe, and its use will prevent the side effects that occur with systemic chemotherapy, and eliminate the need for irradiation and enucleation </plain></SENT>
