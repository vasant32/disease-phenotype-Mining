<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Initial reports of stent-assisted angioplasty for intracranial vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> suggest this is a feasible treatment, but there have been little data regarding predictors of success or failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a series of patients for independent predictors of neurologic morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patient charts and angiograms from 39 patients who underwent intracranial angioplasty and stent placement of vertebrobasilar stenoses were retrospectively reviewed to obtain clinical and detailed angiographic data on potential predictors of neurologic morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses of these predictors were performed with either Fisher's exact test or simple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was subsequently performed on the statistically significant predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete clinical data were obtained for 39 patients, and angiographic review was possible for 35 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed severe intracranial vertebral (n = 18), basilar (n = 15), or basilar and vertebral (n = 2) stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (5.1%) died in the periprocedural period, nine patients (23.1%) had neurologic complications, and one patient (2.6%) had transient neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed female sex, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and failure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy were associated with neurologic morbidity, whereas female sex, Mori B lesion, and length-to-stenosis ratio were associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was the only independent predictor of neurologic morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of the limited number of patients available for analysis, the only independent predictor of neurologic morbidity and mortality was <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but several other predictors showed trends that deserve further review in future series </plain></SENT>
