<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The brain's resistance to ischemic injury can be transiently augmented by prior exposure to a sub-lethal stress stimulus, i.e. preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in the preconditioning-induced protective effect against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of preconditioning with a TLR2 specific ligand, Pam3CSK4, on focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pam3CSK4 was administered systemically 24 h before the mice were subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (1 h) followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined, blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) permeability was evaluated, and expression of tight-junction proteins were examined after focal cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that pre-treatment with Pam3CSK significantly reduced brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (1.9+/-0.5% vs 9.4+/-2.2%) compared with the untreated I/R group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pam3CSK4 pre-treatment also significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mortality (4.3% vs 24.2%), preserved neurological function (8.22+/-0.64 vs 3.91+/-0.57), and attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (84.61+/-0.08% vs 85.29+/-0.09%) after cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, Pam3CSK4 pre-treatment preserved <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function as evidenced by decreased leakage of serum albumin (0.528+/-0.026 vs 0.771+/-0.059) and Evans Blue (9.23+/-0.72 microg/mg vs 12.56+/-0.65 microg/mg) into brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pam3CSK4 pre-treatment also attenuated the loss of the tight junction protein occludin in response to brain I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TLR2 is a new target of ischemic preconditioning in the brain and preconditioning with a TLR2 specific ligand will protect the brain from I/R injury </plain></SENT>
