<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> could improve electrophysiological and neurobehavioral recoveries in rats after 72 hr of reperfusion following 1.5 hr of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or vehicle was given intravenously at the commencement of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurobehavioral outcome was serially examined, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were recorded prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at 72 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain infarction</z:e> was assessed upon killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, stable SSEP waveforms were consistently recorded after individual fore- or hindpaw stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amplitude between the first positive (P1) and the first negative (N1) peaks and the P1 latency did not differ significantly between controls and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 72 hr of reperfusion, controls had severely depressant SSEPs recorded from ischemic fore- and hindpaw cortical fields, and the amplitudes decreased to 36 and 35% of baselines, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These animals also had transcallosal electrophysiological diaschisis in the SSEPs recorded at the contralateral hindpaw cortical field (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>-treated animals not only had significantly improved amplitudes of the SSEPs recorded from both ischemic fore- and hindpaw cortical fields, by 33 and 37% of baselines, respectively (P &lt; 0.001), but also exhibited diminished transcallosal electrophysiological diaschisis following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> improved sensory and motor neurobehavioral outcomes by 40 and 28%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001), and reduced cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes by 32 and 40%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, delayed intravenous administration with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> both enhances electrophysiological and neurobehavioral recoveries and reduces cortical and striatal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
