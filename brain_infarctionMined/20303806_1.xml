<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cerebral embolisation constitutes the main source of complications during transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) and is associated with a high incidence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to evaluate the incidence of new ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> following transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal for neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients underwent transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) were performed within 24 h before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI studies were compared blindly by two independent neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New hyper-intense DW signals were interpreted as ischaemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was followed for at least 30 days following intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were technically successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (61%) patients were symptomatic Mean carotid flow reversal time was 22 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no major adverse events at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained neurologically intact without increase in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty subjects had paired DW-MRI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-procedural DW-MRI ischaemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in four (12.5%) patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the treated hemisphere and asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stents remained patent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients remained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that transcervical carotid stenting with carotid flow reversal carries a low incidence of new ischaemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, significantly lower than that reported with transfemoral CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The transcervical approach with carotid flow reversal may improve the safety of CAS and has the potential to produce results comparable to those of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
