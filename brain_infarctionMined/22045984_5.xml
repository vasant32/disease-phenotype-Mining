<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reorganizations of the platelet cytoskeleton are crucial for platelet shape change and secretion and are thought to involve activation of the small GTPase RhoA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo consequences of megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific RhoA gene deletion in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a pronounced macrothrombocytopenia in RhoA-deficient mice, with platelet counts of approximately half that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutant cells displayed an altered shape but only a moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>reduced life span</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shape change of RhoA-deficient platelets in response to G(13)-coupled <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> was abolished, and it was impaired in response to G(q) stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, RhoA was required for efficient secretion of Î± and dense granules downstream of G(13) and G(q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, RhoA was essential for integrin-mediated clot retraction but not for actomyosin rearrangements and spreading of activated platelets on fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, RhoA deficiency resulted in markedly prolonged tail <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times but also significant protection in different models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and in a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these results establish RhoA as an important regulator of platelet function in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and hemostasis </plain></SENT>
