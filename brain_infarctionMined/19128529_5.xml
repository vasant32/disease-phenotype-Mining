<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study examined whether patients with PSEI have more frontal and/or basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and impairment in executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 516 Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> consecutively admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit of a university-affiliated regional hospital in Hong Kong were screened for PSEI 3 months after the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to Kim's criteria, 39 (7.6%) had PSEI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without PSEI served as matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PSEI group had significantly more frontal and/or basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, had lower Chinese Frontal Assessment Battery scores, required more time to complete the Stroop Test, and made more omission and commission errors in the Go-NoGo test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between frontal or basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation between frontal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and severity of PSEI was .420 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further follow-up and functional imaging studies are warranted to explore the relationship between PSEI, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
