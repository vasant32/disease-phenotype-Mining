<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the possible association between aortic arch stiffness, which may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and cardiac and cerebral end-organ damage in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by using magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Approval from the local institutional review board was obtained, and patients gave informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (31 women and 19 men; mean age +/- standard deviation, 49.2 years +/- 12.7; mean systolic blood pressure, 152.1 mm Hg +/- 22.3; mean diastolic blood pressure, 88.0 mm Hg +/- 13.1), compliant for treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medication, were prospectively enrolled for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations of the aorta, heart, and brain with standard pulse sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic arch pulse wave velocity (PWV), left ventricular (LV) mass, LV systolic and diastolic function, lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariable and multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean aortic arch PWV was 7.3 m/sec +/- 2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic arch PWV was statistically significantly associated with LV mass (r = 0.30, P = .03, beta = 1.73); indexes of systolic function, including ejection fraction (r = -0.38, P = .01, beta = -1.12); indexes of diastolic function, including the ratio of early diastolic to atrial contraction peak filling rates (r = -0.44, P &lt; .01, beta = -0.11); lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, P &lt; .01); and periventricular (OR = 1.5, P = .01) and deep (OR = 1.6, P = .01) WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic arch PWV was statistically significantly associated with LV mass (r = 0.37, P = .03, beta = 2.11) and lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (OR = 1.8, P = .04), independent of age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> duration, but not with indexes of diastolic and systolic function and WMHs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aortic arch stiffness is associated with LV mass and lacunar brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in hypertensive patients, independent of age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> duration; these manifestations of end-organ damage may help to risk stratify hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
