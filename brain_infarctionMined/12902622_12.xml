<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> such as older age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and smoking have been suggested as risk factors for WMD in the periventricular and subcortical areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no epidemiologic study has examined the associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and WMD in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 789 participants, aged 65 years or older, from the Cardiovascular Health Study constituted the present study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WMD, defined as hyperintensive lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in the brain stem was measured in 1992/1993 and 1997/1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 789 participants, 212 (26.9%) had WMD in the brain stem in 1997/1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of WMD in the brain stem in 1997/1998 was significantly associated with several variables measured in 1992/1993: an increase by 5 years of age (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.25-1.83), a 10-pack-years increase in smoking (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.21), a 0.1-liter increase in first-second forced expiratory volume (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99), a 1 micromol/l increase in fibrinogen level (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23), and MRI infarction (OR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.78-3.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excluding those (n = 167) with WMD in the brain stem in 1992/1993, the pattern remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was not associated with WMD in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased age, smoking, lower forced expiratory volume, increased fibrinogen level, and MRI infarction, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, may be independent risk factors for WMD in the brain stem in older adults </plain></SENT>
