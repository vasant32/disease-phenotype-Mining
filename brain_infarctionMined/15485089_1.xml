<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate incidence and number of abnormal cerebral hyperintensities (ACFs) in Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI) and its relation to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) in divers with no history of decompression illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cohort study on 50 divers (21-5500 dives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and number of ACFs visualized by cranial MRI and presence and size of a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> as documented by echocardiography and transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) with echocontrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 137 ACFs was found in the 50 subjects, with a significant correlation between the number of dives and number of ACFs (r = 0.28; p &lt; 0.05); but after correction for age, the remaining correlation (r = 0.15) did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 18 divers, a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was present by either the application of echocardiography or TCD; in 12 divers, the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was of high hemodynamic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten of 18 divers with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> had at least one ACF, while in the remaining 32 divers, only 14 had at least one ACF (56% versus 44%, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of 14 divers (50%) with 4 ACFs had a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, compared to 11 of 36 (31%) with less than 4 ACFs (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this cohort of healthy divers, in contrast to an earlier report, no significant association was found between <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> presence and incidence or number of ACFs </plain></SENT>
