<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive subjects participating in a prospective cohort study of aging and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> enriched for vascular risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> underwent structural MRI scans at 3-T and 4-T MRI at 3 sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Freesurfer (Version 5.1) was used to obtain regional measures of neocortical volumes (mm3) and thickness (mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was used to determine the association of Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Profile and carotid artery intima-media thickness with cortical volume and thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two subjects (82 men) were aged 78 (±7) years, 94 had a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating of 0, 58 had a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> rating of 0.5, and the mean Mini-Mental State Examination was 28±2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Profile score was inversely associated with total gray matter volume and parietal and temporal gray matter volume (adjusted P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Profile was inversely associated with parietal and total cerebral gray matter thickness (adjusted P&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery intima-media thickness was inversely associated with thickness of parietal gray matter only (adjusted P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Including history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and radiological evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype did not alter relationships with Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Profile or carotid artery intima-media thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased cardiovascular risk was associated with reduced gray matter volume and thickness in regions also affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> independent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a "double hit" toward developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> when someone with incipient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> also has high cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
