<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Difficulty for distal exposure of the ICA is sometimes encountered during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A carotid shunt is used to maintain sufficient cerebral blood flow during CEA but requires <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> materials, such as a string or a metallic ring, which often restrict the operative field, especially that of the distal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here, we describe a novel technique for carotid shunt fixation using a unique <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi> device in CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the method presented here, the carotid shunt is fixed with an inflated balloon and a conventional vascular tourniquet proximally, but distal fixation is achieved using a Sugita's fenestrated clip that catches the mid portion of the carotid shunt and surrounding tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The device prevents the distal carotid shunt slipping out of the distal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present method allows mobilization of the shunt position during CEA and facilitates far-distal exposure of the ICA </plain></SENT>
