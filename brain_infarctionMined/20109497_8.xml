<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (PROG) protects against animal brain injury, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, in various animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are insufficient studies about PROG in other various groups such as ovariectomized females and aged animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the efficacy of PROG on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, brain water content and functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six male aged Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO) with the intraluminal filament technique and sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After induction of pMCAO, the rats received an initial intraperitoneal injection of PROG (8mg/kg) or vehicle at 1h post-occlusion followed by subcutaneous injections at 6, 24 and 48h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional deficits were tested with Zea Longa and Rotarod test at 24, 48 and 72h after pMCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats were killed 72h after surgery and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume were determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining and digital image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain water content was determined by the dry-wet weight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PROG-treated rats showed a substantial reduction in the volume of the infarction (% contralateral hemisphere) and brain water content compared to vehicle-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant improvement in ability to remain on an accelerating rotarod and increased Zea Longa scores observed in the pMCAO rats treated with PROG compared to vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings point to the response of aged adult rats to PROG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and suggest that such response need to be considered in the development of neuroprotective agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
