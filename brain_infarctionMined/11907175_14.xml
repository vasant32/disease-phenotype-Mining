<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone in the cortex and striatum of the left hemisphere was consistently identified in the cortex and striatum of the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area was significantly reduced after three intraperitoneal administrations of 10, 30, or 50 mg/kg KR-31378 at 5 min, 4 h, and 8 h after the completion of 2 h of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with KR-31378 (30 or 50 mg/kg) significantly reduced the increase in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling positive cells as well as strongly suppressed the laddered feature of DNA fragmentation in the lateral cortical tissue corresponding to the penumbra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of samples from penumbral zone, which showed markedly reduced Bcl-2 protein level and increased Bax protein and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release, were wholly reversed by treatment with KR-31378 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, postischemic treatment with KR-31378 provided significant levels of cortical neuroprotection in association with inhibition of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through the up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, and the down-regulation of Bax protein and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
