<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi>, geniposide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi> and concha margaritifera respectively for 3 hrs, and then their brain tissue were taken to extract the total protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein expression in ischemic mouse brain was analyzed with surface-enhanced laser desorption/inionation-time of flight-mass spectra (SELDI-TOF-MS) protein-chip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The four components tested had effect on 3 target proteins at 5373Da, 5707Da and 15103Da, showing the nature of multi-target and with different action on protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Protein-chip is an effective approach for exploring the pharmacological mechanism of Chinese herbal fraction </plain></SENT>
