<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the changes of circadian blood pressure patterns after thromboembolic and hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and evaluated the relation between circadian blood pressure variation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> location, and activation of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Repeated 24-hour blood pressure measurements were performed in 45 patients with proven first-ever <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> of different origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentration, prolongation of the QT interval, and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were used to determine the extent of sympathetic activation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whereas circadian blood pressure variation was significantly increased after hemodynamic infarction compared with a control group (diastolic, -25.2 +/- 4.5% versus -13.8 +/- 6.5%; p &lt; .005), a clearly reduced variation was observed after thromboembolic infarction (diastolic, -5.2 +/- 6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure variation was positively related to serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> concentration (r = .79; P &lt; .01) after thromboembolic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with involvement of the insular cortex showed a nocturnal rise of blood pressure significantly more frequently (66.7% versus 11.8%; P &lt; .005) and had higher <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels (66.7 +/- 110 pg/mL versus 290 +/- 178 pg/mL; P &lt; .01) than patients without insular cortex infarction, indicating increased sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a significantly more frequent occurrence of QT prolongation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences in circadian blood pressure patterns may (1) help to distinguish the pathophysiological basis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, (2) help to explain worsening in some cases of hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, (3) confirm the importance of the insular cortex for sympathetic activation, and (4) identify subgroups of patients with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
