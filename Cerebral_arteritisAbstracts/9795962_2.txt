To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of combined intracranial and extracranial hemorrhage due to aspergillus cerebral arteritis. Knowledge of the imaging and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment are emphasized. A 78 year old man developed progressive right-sided visual impairment and diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass lesion located in the right orbital apex, with extension to the cavernous sinus and the right middle cranial fossa. Cerebral angiography showed no aneurysmal dilatation. He was scheduled for transnasal biopsy. However, the patient died of massive epistaxis and intracranial hemorrhage. Postmortem examination revealed an aspergillus granuloma of the orbit and the skull base involving the intracranial and extracranial internal carotid artery. Aspergillus fumigatus was identified by culture. The characteristic feature of the fungal infection is a low-intensity signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. This finding may be useful in diagnosing fungal infection.
