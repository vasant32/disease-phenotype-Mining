Acute right hemiplegia and transient expressive aphasia occurred in a 7-year-old girl a few days after nonspecific constitutional symptoms and the appearance of a large right submandibular lymph node. Biopsy of this node and lack of other evident cause suggested a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease. Carotid arteriography showed a localized arteritis of the supraclinoid part of the left internal carotid artery and the left middle cerebral artery, involving also some lenticulostriate vessels. Computerized tomography demonstrated infarction in the left internal capsule. The size of this infarct and the angiographic abnormalities improved 6 weeks after onset, and coincided with clinical recovery. Cat-scratch disease may have caused the localized arteritis.
