Herpes zoster of the ophthalmic division of the left fifth cranial nerve with contralateral hemiparesis was observed in a 30-year-old man. Left carotid angiography showed segmental constrictions consistent with cerebral arteritis, possibly provoked by direct viral infection along the intracranial part of the ophthalmic nerve. An ischaemic lesion revealed by computed tomographic scan was considered secondary to arteritis and responsible for the hemiparesis. The presence of an immune response within the blood-CSF barrier was suggested by an increase of oligoclonal CSF IgG and IgA.
