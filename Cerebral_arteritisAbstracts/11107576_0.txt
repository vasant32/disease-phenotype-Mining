In this paper we wanted to present cases of stroke occurring in the course of cerebral vasculitis. Cerebral vasculitis occurs most often in patients with infections, tumours and connective tissue diseases. Idiopathic vasculitis is observed very rarely and making the diagnosis meets great difficulties. Three patients (2 women and 1 man) with idiopathic cerebral arteritis aged 28-41 who underwent treatment in our department are prevented. There were no known stroke risk factors in anamnesis and diagnostic investigations. All patients had headaches before the occurrence of stroke. Electrocardiography, echocardiography were normal. Two patients had arteriography--small arterial occlusions and changes in arteries' walls were seen. Ischaemic changes in both cerebral hemispheres were shown in CT and MRI scans. One patient had high serum level of antinuclear antibodies one year later the diagnosis of lupus erythematosus was made. In patients with cerebral vasculitis extensive laboratory investigations should be carried out and combined with a detailed follow-up study. Neurological changes could be the first symptom of connective tissue disease.
