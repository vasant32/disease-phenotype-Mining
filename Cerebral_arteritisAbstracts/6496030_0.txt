A case of isolated cerebral vasculitis showing benign outcome is presented. Review of pertinent literature suggests that isolated benign arteritis of the CNS should be considered as a distinct entity, in a heterogeneous group of vasculitides. The common features of the syndrome are as follows: 1(0) benign evolution; 2(0) sensitiveness to cortisone; 3(0) absence of CSF alterations; 4(0) constant angiographic pattern of arteritis. Early cortisone treatment is suggested in any case of cerebral arteritis.
