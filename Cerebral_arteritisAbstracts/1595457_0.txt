The authors present a case of probable amphetamine-induced cerebral arteritis in a 31-year-old man with AIDS, testicular carcinoma, and recurrent pneumocystis pneumonia. MR enhancement was demonstrated in areas of focal arterial ectasia, presumably due to slow flow. CT, MR, and angiographic findings were strikingly confirmed postmortem. Angiography remains essential in the diagnosis of cerebral arteritis.
