 OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of aortic valve preservation and root reconstruction in patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: From July 2003 to Dec 2007, 22 patients with Marfan syndrome were treated by aortic valve preservation and root reconstruction. There were 12 male and 10 female, the age ranged from 10 to 57 years old with a mean of (28 +/- 10) years. The operation procedures included reimplantation technique in 9 patients, remodeling technique in 8 patients, and patch technique in 2 patients. In addition, reimplantation technique + total aorta replacement in 1 patient, remodeling technique + "aortic arch replacement + stent-elephant trunk" in 1 patient, patch technique + "aortic arch replacement + stent-elephant trunk" in 1 patient. The patients were followed-up by 17 to 64 months with a mean of (46 +/- 16) months. RESULTS: No in-hospital and follow-up period death occurred. There was one reexploration for bleeding 1 d postoperative. No valve-related complication occurred during the follow-up. At the end of follow-up, no aortic regurgitation was demonstrate in 16 patients, but mild regurgitation in 4 patients, moderate regurgitation in 1 patient and severe regurgitation in 1 patient. Two patients with moderate and severe aortic regurgitation need reoperation 1 year postoperative. CONCLUSION: The early and mid-term results of aortic valve preservation and root reconstruction operations in Marfan syndrome were favorable.
