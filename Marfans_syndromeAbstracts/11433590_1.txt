The authors present results of 32 operations with capsular tension ring performed in eyes with zonular dehiscence. There were 14 women (50%) and 14 men (50%), altogether 28 patients (32 eyes). Mean patient age was 47.1 years (range 22-89 years). The reason for zonular weakness was trauma in 15 eyes (46.9%), Marfan's syndrome in 8 eyes (25.0%), pseudoexfoliation syndrome in 6 eyes (18.7%) and high myopia in 3 eyes (9.4%). Anterior vitrectomy was done if the vitreous appeared in the anterior chamber. Early postoperative complications were fibrinoid reaction in 2 eyes (6.3%), intraocular pressure elevation in 5 eyes (15.6%), hyphaema in 2 eyes (6.3%). Best corrected visual acuity was 0.5 or better in 18 eyes (56.3%) on the first postoperative day and in 17 eyes (53.1%) at the time of the last examination. Our results have shown the high efficiency of the capsular tension ring in managing zonular problems during cataract surgery.
