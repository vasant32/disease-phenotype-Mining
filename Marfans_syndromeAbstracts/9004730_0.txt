We report our experience in the diagnosis, evaluation and counseling for the Marfan Syndrome in 35 individuals of 23 families. Utilizing the new clinical and diagnostic criteria, we observed that the frequency of the systems affected corresponds to those found in the literature. Presymptomatic treatment is possible, and considering the family history in the diagnosis is needed for adequate genetic counseling and the well-being of the affected patient.
