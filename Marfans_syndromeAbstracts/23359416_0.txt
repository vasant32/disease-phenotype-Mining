OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether total arch replacement (TAR) during initial surgery for root aneurysm should be routinely performed in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 94 consecutive MFS patients fulfilling Ghent criteria who underwent 148 aortic surgeries and were followed at this institution during the past 16 years. RESULTS: The mean follow-up interval was 8.8 Â± 7 years. Initial presentation was acute aortic dissection (AAD) in 35% of patients (76% Type A and 24% Type B) and aneurismal disease in 65%. TAR was performed in 8% of patients during initial surgery for AAD (otherwise a hemi-arch replacement was performed) and 1.6% in elective root repair. Secondary TAR had to be performed in only 3% of patients without, but in 33% following AAD (33% Type A and 33% Type B; P = 0.0001). Thirty-day, 6-month, 1-year and overall mortalities were 3.2, 5.3, 6.4 and 11.7%, respectively. Operative and 30-day mortalities in secondary aortic arch replacement were zero. Secondary TAR after AAD did not increase the need for the replacement of the entire thoracoabdominal aorta during follow-up compared with patients without secondary TAR (37 vs 40%, P = 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: MFS patients undergoing elective root repair have small risk of reinterventions on the aortic arch, and primary prophylactic replacement does not seem to be justified. In patients with AAD, the need for reinterventions is precipitated by the dissection itself and not by limiting the procedure to the hemi-arch replacement in the emergency setting. Limiting surgery to the aortic root, ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch is associated with low mortality in MFS patients presenting with AAD.
