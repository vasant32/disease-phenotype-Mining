The superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitor, TRIEN, which enhanced the formation of gamma-induced DNA breaks in cells of healthy donors and patients with Marfan syndrome and Bloom syndrome (repair-defective hereditary diseases), had virtually no effect on the formation of radioadaptive response (RAR) in these systems. Similar results were obtained in studies on cell survival: TRIEN facilitated mortality in cells irradiated with gamma-rays but did not affect RAR formation. TRIEN also increased the deleterious effect of CdCl2, which indicates that SOD apparently plays a certain role in cell defence against this mutagen.
