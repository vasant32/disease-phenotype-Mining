PURPOSE: We report the anaesthetic management of a 34-yr-old pregnant woman with recurrent aortic dissection and Marfan syndrome for Caesarean section. CLINICAL FEATURES: She presented at 28 wk gestation with recurrent aortic dissection and had undergone aortic valve replacement and coronary ostia reimplantation (Bentall procedure) in the first trimester of pregnancy. She was treated in hospital with labetalol, anticoagulants and steroids and daily echocardiographic examination until 34 wk when caesarean section was planned. After positioning radial artery and CVP catheters and a transoesophageal echocardiographic probe, general anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with isoflurane, and endotracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium. The site of incision was infiltrated with lidocaine before surgery which was uneventful. The patient was discharged at 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate preoperative care and monitoring, uneventful general anaesthesia for caesarean section was achieved in a patient with Marfan syndrome in the presence of recurrent aortic dissection.
