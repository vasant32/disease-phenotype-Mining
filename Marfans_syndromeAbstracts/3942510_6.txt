The familial occurrence of intracranial aneurysms and the possible relationship with connective tissue disease are discussed. We studied a large family in which seven members presented with aneurysms. Another family member presented with a subarachnoidal hemorrhage. Two other family members each presented with Marfan's syndrome and an unclassified multiple congenital anomalies syndrome, respectively. The multiplicity of the aneurysms in four members is in excess of that found in sporadic or familial cases with intracranial aneurysms. We suggest a common cause, eg, a connective tissue disorder for both the intracranial aneurysms, the Marfan's syndrome, and the unclassified syndrome.
