Annuloaortic ectasia (AAE), in which there is an idiopathic aortic root dilation leading to pure aortic regurgitaion (AR), is a rare disorder and is usually seen as a forme--fruste of Marfan's syndrome. We report a case in which the patient presented with rapid onset of symptoms of heart failure and was being treated for mitral regurgitation due to dilated cardiomyopathy. Postmortem findings revealed an enlarged heart with annuloaortic ectasia.
