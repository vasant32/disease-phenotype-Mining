Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders. In this study we performed SSCP to analyze all 65 exons of the FBN1 gene in 76 patients presenting with classical MFS or related phenotypes. We report 7 missense mutations, 3 splice site alterations, one indel mutation, one nonsense mutation and two mutations causing frameshifts: a 16bp deletion and a single nucleotide insertion. 5 of the missense mutations (Y1101C, C1806Y, T1908I, G1919D, C2251R) occur in calcium-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGFcb) domains of exons 26, 43, 46 and 55, respectively. One missense mutation (V449I) substitutes a valine residue in the non-calcium-binding epidermal growth factor like domain (EGFncb) of exon 11. One missense mutation (G880S) affects the "hybrid" motif in exon 21 by replacing glycine to serine. The 3 splice site mutations detected are: IVS1-1G>A in intron 1, IVS38-1G>A in intron 38 and IVS46+5G>A in intron 46. C628delinsK was identified in exon 15 leading to the substitution of a conserved cysteine residue. Furthermore two frameshift mutations were found in exon 15 (1904-1919del ) and exon 63 (8025insC) leading to premature termination codons (PTCs) in exon 17 and 64 respectively. Finally we identified a nonsense mutation (R429X) located in the proline rich domain in exon 10 of the FBN1 gene. Y1101C, IVS46+5G>A and R429X have been reported before.
