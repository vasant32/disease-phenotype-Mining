Coexisting pectus deformity and congenital heart disease is not uncommon. Traditionally, the approach to this problem has been to repair each one with a separate surgical procedure because of fear of increased complications from bleeding, infections, and anesthesia. More recently, many reports of successful combined repair have been published, particularly in adults with coronary artery or aortic pathology. The authors wished to determine the feasibility of this combined procedure in younger patients, particularly those with a severe pectus deformity. Three patients underwent repair, including a 17 year old with Marfan's syndrome and a severe pectus excavatum deformity. The postoperative course was smooth for these patients, and all had good short- and long-term (over 18 months) results.
