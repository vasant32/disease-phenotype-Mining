We report a patient with Marfan syndrome who received successful 7 consecutive operations during 11 years. She underwent descending aortic replacement for chronic type B dissection at the age of 24. Mitral valve replacement (MVR) was performed for mitral regurgitation (MR) at the age of 30, and abdominal aortic replacement was done for persistent dissection at the age of 31, aortic root and arch replacement was done at the age of 34. The 9 months later, she received re-MVR for dysfunction of bioprosthesis and tricuspid valve anuloplasty (TAP) for tricuspid regurgitation (TR). But severe paravalvuler leakage of mitral valve necessitated direct closure of detachment. Thoracoabdominal replacement was performed for rupture of persistent dissection at the age of 35. She was discharged on the 54th day after the 7th surgery.
