In the work are presented the results of echocardiographic investigation of 19 patients (aged 11-15) with kyphoscoliotic spine deformities at the Marfan's syndrome. The analysis of the obtained data has shown that the most common type of the cardiovascular system pathology in 78.9% of the examined children and adolescents was the II and III stage prolapse of the mitral valve. The changes of the heart cavity dimensions and the signs of the ventricle overloading have not been detected. Prolapse of the mitral valve cusps to the III stage was the most often accompanied by the root and aorta ascending section dilatation. The presence of the heart affection should be considered as one of the indications to carry out the corrective operations at the spine, allowing to reduce the heart overloading and decrease the probability and rate of progression of the cardiac disturbances, specific for this syndrome.
