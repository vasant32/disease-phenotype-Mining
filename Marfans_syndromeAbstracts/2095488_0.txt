104 patients with progressive forms of funnel chest deformity of the II-III degree with Ehlers-Danlos-Marfan syndrome, Marfan-like phenotype, isolated funnel chest deformity and unclassified funnel chest deformity of the first degree were subjected to synromologic examination. There were detected 10 dysplastic signs, indicating funnel chest deformity progression: anti-Mongol shape of the eyes, arachnodactyly, high palate, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, floor of the auricle's dysplasia, dolichostenomely, posture disturbance, mitral valve prolapse, umbilical hernia, wide filter. The results of biochemical examination of collagen metabolite--hydroxyproline++ (the first and the second hydroxyproline++ fraction ratio disturbance, decrease of the first hydroxyproline++ fraction percentage, disturbance of direct correlation between total hydroxyproline++ and percentage of the first hydroxyproline++ fraction)--corroborated the clinical data.
