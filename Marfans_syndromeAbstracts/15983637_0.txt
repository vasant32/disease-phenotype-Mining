Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Recent studies indicate that decreased bone mineral density (BMD) occurs in the spine, femoral necks and greater trochanters of some adults and children with MFS. Since there is uncertainty regarding the BMD status of patients with MFS, the authors present a case report on a female patient with MFS and alteration of phosphocalcic metabolism.
