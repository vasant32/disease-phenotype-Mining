PURPOSE: Ectopia lentis remains a therapeutic challenge for ophthalmologists. It classically presents with a preceding history of blunt or penetrating ocular trauma, or it may be associated with other ocular disorders such as congenital glaucoma and aniridia, or concomitant hereditary systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: The authors describe a previously unreported mechanism of ocular trauma associated with continuous eye rubbing, resulting in bilateral recurrent subluxation of both intraocular lens and crystalline lens. CONCLUSIONS: It is useful for the ophthalmologist to be aware of this uncommon cause of ectopia lentis, since early advice and appropriate medical or surgical intervention may prevent more severe, sight-threatening complications.
