Marfanoid habitus suggests abnormal microfibril formation, whereas a situs ambiguus or situs inversus phenotype points to defective left-right axis determination. The concurrence of these two abnormalities has been reported only once in the literature. We report a similar phenotype in two unrelated patients. Documentation of this specific combination of Marfanoid habitus and abnormal situs gives further credence to the notion that the combination may represent a distinct syndrome.
