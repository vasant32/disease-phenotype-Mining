 OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility of midface distraction for correction of severe syndromic Four consecutive patients with severe syndromic midface retrusion underwent midface retrusion. METHODS: distraction osteogenesis. The patients(three girls and one boy) aged from 4 to 12 years. Two were with Crouzon syndrome, one with Apert and one with Marfan syndrome. One was treated with Le Fort III external distraction, two with Le Fort III internal distraction, and the other with monobloc internal distraction. The distraction devices were activated on the fourth postoperative day at 1 mm per day. RESULTS: All patients completed the distraction as activated on the fourth postoperative day at 1 mm per day. Results was planned. Successful advancement of 8 to 20 mm was obtained at the occlusal level in all patients as measured by cephalograms. The facial appearance was significantly improved,especially in the orbits and the upper part of the nose. Follow-up from 4 months to one year demonstrated that the face was symmetrical. All patients obtained This study shows that although midface distraction osteogenesis needs to be satisfactory results. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that although midface distraction osteogenesis needs to be improved to increase its controllability, it has obvious advantages over the traditional way of bone graft and rigid fixation. Midface distraction avoids bone grafts and alleviates the restriction of the soft tissue to midfacial bone advancement. Midface distraction osteogenesis is an effective and practical way to correct severe syndromic midfacial hypoplasia.
