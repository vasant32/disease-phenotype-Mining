BACKGROUND: We consider operative survival as the primary objective in acute type A dissection and believe that virtually all native aortic valves can be conserved. We sought to answer the question: "Does glue repair improve the long-term stability of proximal aortic repair?" METHODS: We retrospectively studied 64 patients with an acute type A dissection, an ascending aortic tear, and aortic regurgitation operated on by the same surgeon between 1988 and 1996. Three had Marfan's syndrome and 2 had a bicuspid valve. The valves in all patients without Marfan's syndrome were repaired with gelatin-resorcinol-formol glue. The valve and root were reinvestigated by echocardiography. Some patients underwent nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: There were four hospital (6%) and three late deaths. Aortic root reoperation was required in 2 of the 60 survivors (3.3%) and operation on the distal aorta in 2. Root reoperations were required within 3 years. The remaining proximal repairs remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: The native aortic valve can be conserved in most patients, and glue repair is durable. Simple root repair is associated with a low operative mortality.
