We successfully repaired a ruptured aortic patch containing the visceral arteries after thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair in a young patient with Marfan syndrome. This unexpected and tricky situation was treated by separate revascularization of each visceral artery using small-caliber prosthetic grafts as interposition between the aortic prosthesis and the ostia of the visceral arteries.
