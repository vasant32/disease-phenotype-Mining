BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Annular stability is not guaranteed after mitral repair without a prosthetic ring. We introduce a newly developed plication technique and detail its stabilizing effect on the mitral annulus after Gerbode plasty. METHODS: Patients suffered degenerative mitral valve prolapse with chordal rupture restricted to the middle scallop of the posterior leaflet. Between 1986 and 1997, 102 patients underwent Gerbode plasty with or without annular reinforcement with a pericardial strip or modified Paneth plasty (group C). The mean (+/- SD) follow up was 70.4 +/- 41.1 months. Since 1996, 32 patients have undergone a newly developed annuloplasty technique (group N), where a pericardial strip was tightly anchored to the bilateral trigones and posterior annulus, which was folded by Gerbode plasty. With the final anchoring suture the intention was to prevent plication breakdown of this portion. Mean follow up for this group was 17.6 +/- 7.1 months. Progression of mitral regurgitation after surgery in both groups was studied. RESULTS: In group C, postoperative progression of mitral valve regurgitation occurred in 41.1% of patients (5.9% to grade 1, 17.6% to grade 2, 17.6% to grade 3). Among these patients, reoperation was due to plication breakdown of the Gerbode plasty in six cases (5.9%), and to either chordal rupture or annular dilatation in 10 cases each (9.8%). In contrast, no reoperation due to recurrent severe mitral regurgitation was needed in group N. Progression of mitral regurgitation after surgery was seen in six patients (two to grade 1; four to grade 2). CONCLUSION: The newly developed annuloplasty technique may be useful in stabilizing the mitral annulus after Gerbode plasty.
