Development of a new systolic murmur in patients following a Bental procedure with a prosthetic or homograft aortic valve usually indicates an aortic valve-related complication. Here, we report new etiologies of a loud systolic murmur in patients with aortic disease. One patient developed a new loud systolic murmur as an initial manifestation of acute type A aortic dissection without any complication, and two patients developed a loud systolic murmur as the major manifestation of aortic graft failure following aortic root surgery. Auscultation of a new loud systolic murmur in the upper chest in patients with known aortic disease should alert one to a complication within the ascending aorta.
