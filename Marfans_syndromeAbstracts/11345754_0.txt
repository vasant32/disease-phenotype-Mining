Ten pregnancies and 7 deliveries in 5 patients of Marfan syndrome were managed at our institution. Three patients were delivered with a cesarean section under general anesthesia, and one was delivered under epidural anesthesia. Three underwent vaginal delivery with epidural anesthesia. Two patients selected induced abortion, and one had a spontaneous abortion. Six of 7 neonates and all 5 mothers survived without any sequela. One had intrauterine fetal death due to dissection of aortic aneurysm. Simultaneous cesarean section and cardiovascular operation under cardiopulmonary bypass were performed in one case. In the parturient without progress of cardiovascular complication during pregnancy, painless labor under epidural anesthesia is our first choice to minimize hemodynamic derangement. Invasive arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure were monitored in all cases of vaginal delivery for tight hemodynamic control. Epidural anesthesia is also preferred in cases of elective cesarean section for obstetric indication. Emergency cesarean sections are performed in the cases of progressive dissection and urgent obstetric indication. General anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and midazolam to minimize cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation. We emphasize that evaluation of cardiovascular status and multidisciplinary approach are the key in the anesthetic management of parturients with Marfan syndrome.
