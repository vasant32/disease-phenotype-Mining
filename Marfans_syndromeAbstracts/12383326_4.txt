Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) or Beals-Hecht syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin-2 (FBN2) gene. The principal features of CCA are a marfanoid habitus, multiple congenital contractures, camptodactyly, arachnodactyly, kyphoscoliosis, muscular hypoplasia, and external ear malformations. Our case is the first that shows typical sonographic signs in a fetus at 25 weeks' gestation with molecular genetically verified CCA in a large family with many members affected over four generations. This demonstrates that CCA can be detected prenatally by non-invasive ultrasonography. The importance of confirmation of CCA by means of DNA sequence analysis of the FBN2 gene is stressed.
