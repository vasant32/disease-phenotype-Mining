Tetralogy of Fallot is often found in association with a wide variety of other cardiac lesions, but is rarely found in association with lesions causing obstruction to the left ventricular inflow or outflow. Subaortic stenosis has only rarely been reported in association with tetralogy of Fallot. We report a patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent repair of tetralogy of Fallot at five years of age. Discrete and progressive subaortic stenosis developed two years after the surgical correction, in a previously normal and unobstructed left ventricular outflow tract. Surgical removal of the acquired fibrous subaortic shelf was successful. Clinical signs of obstruction within the left ventricular outflow tract after surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot should prompt further investigation to exclude the onset of acquired subaortic stenosis.
