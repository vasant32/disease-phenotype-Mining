 PURPOSE: Spontaneous dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries represents a rare pathology. Its pathogenesis, probably multi-factorial, can be related to neck trauma and to a genetic basis, extensively demonstrated in the cases of association with type IV fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum and osteogenesis imperfecta. Onset symptoms include neck, facial pain and diffuse headache. Cranial nerve palsy has been also described. The aim of this study was to evaluate MR angiography and MR findings in a population of patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the MR angiography and MR exams of 15 patients (10 males, 5 females, average age 42.0, age range 30-55) with carotid and/or vertebral artery dissection; the serial MR follow-up studies were also examined. RESULTS: Twelve internal carotid arteries (ICA) showed the presence of an irregular stenosis; three of these showed complete occlusion. In two patients both ICA were involved. Six vertebral arteries (VA) showed irregular stenosis (only one patient suffered from both CI and VA dissection); in one case there was also a pseudoaneurysm of the VA. Follow-up studies showed vessel lumen re-opening in 5/11 ICA (one patient underwent vascular stent positioning) and in 3/6 VA. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the usefulness of MR angiography and MR in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissection.
