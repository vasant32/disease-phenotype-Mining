Spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the coronary artery (SDACA) not associated with aortic aneurysm or trauma is a very rare cause of myocardial ischemia. It has a higher prevalence in otherwise healthy women, especially in the peri- and postpartum period. In 80-90% of cases the diagnosis of SDACA is confirmed at autopsy, as the majority of patients present with acute myocardial infarction or sudden death. We describe the case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman who died suddenly without any previous sign of cardiac disease. She had no clinical signs of Marfan's syndrome or arterial hypertension, she used no oral contraceptives and she was not in the peri- or postpartum period. At autopsy we found a recent dissecting aneurysm of the right coronary artery. Histology showed a hematoma between the media and adventitia of the coronary artery, flattening and occluding the lumen. Acute myocardial infarction was present in the posterior wall of the left cardiac ventricle. SDACA is an unpredictable condition and prompt diagnosis and life-saving procedures--either surgical or conservative--are rarely successful. We report a very rare disease documented in only 108 cases according to the English-language literature accessible to us.
