The fibrillin gene (FBN1) is the disease locus for Marfan syndrome. This disorder shows a high degree of clinical and allelic heterogeneity. Direct mutation screening has proven difficult and inefficient and at present cannot be utilized for routine analysis. In familial cases linkage analysis represents a useful tool for molecular diagnosis. We have determined the allelic frequencies of 5 polymorphic markers within the FBN1 locus in the Italian population and have successfully employed them for prenatal diagnosis and resolution of clinically equivocal cases.
