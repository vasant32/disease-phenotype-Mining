A detailed study of cerebral arterial forks by serial sectioning was made in a 33-year-old woman with typical Marfan's syndrome who died of septicemia following cardiac surgery. Two forks of the right middle cerebral artery exhibited the atrophic changes associated with early berry aneurysm formation indicating that the mode of development of these aneurysms is similar in both Marfan's syndrome and in non-Marfan subjects.
