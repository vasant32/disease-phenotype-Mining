A 26-year-old woman with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) underwent posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation for scoliosis. General anesthesia was maintained using propofol and remifentanil. The procedure was performed examining the motor evoked potential (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) of the lower extremities with the patient placed in the prone position. The procedure was completed successfully without major cardiovascular or respiratory complications. The duration of anesthesia was 821 min. When drapes were removed, we noticed that the right shoulder was in a hyperabduction position. After emergence from anesthesia, it was observed that the right upper extremity was paralyzed. Thereafter, brachial plexus injury, which may have been due to intraoperative malpositioning, was diagnosed. Brachial plexus injury is the most common among the nerve injuries resulting from intraoperative malpositioning. Patients with EDS are thought to be at high risk for the complications and it has also been reported that patients with joint hypermobility, such as that in EDS or Marfan syndrome, are highly susceptible to nerve injury. Intraoperative monitoring of the MEP and SSEP in the upper extremities should be considered for early detection and prevention of brachial plexus injury in patients with EDS who are thought to be at high risk.
