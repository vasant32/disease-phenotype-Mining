The Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of connective tissues resulting in ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal deformities. The authors reviewed 22 cases of Marfan syndrome. Forty-five percent (ten of 22) of the patients had acetabular protrusion, with one-half of these being unilateral and one-half bilateral. Scoliosis was associated with acetabular protrusion in 90% of cases (nine of ten). The authors conclude that acetabular protrusion is a common skeletal finding in the Marfan syndrome.
