The surgical treatment of the aortic regurgitation with aneurysm of ascending aorta has been considered by Wheat, Bentall and Cabrol as improved combined techniques. 24 cases of the aortic regurgitation with aneurysm of ascending aorta that had been operated in Mitsui Memorial Hospital from November 1975 to August 1990 were examined their late results with the classification of 3 types of operative techniques (aortic valve replacement alone, Bentall's procedure, and Cabrol's procedure). 5 cases of them with aortic valve replacement alone were elected by their aortic angiographic findings, were not significant differences in their late results in the other cases with Bentall's or Cabrol's procedures. So we considered that treatment of the ascending aortic aneurysm with aortic regurgitation would not be necessary to operate with the combined techniques, but their selection of the indication would be limited in the cases that were not widened in aortic ring diameter in their preoperative angiography, and not complicated the systemic diseases such as Marfan's syndrome.
