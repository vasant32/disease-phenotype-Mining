A four-channeled aortic dissection is quite rare, which is a highly life-threatening situation predisposing to aortic rupture. We report a successful management of a four-channeled aortic dissection and an aortic rupture in a 59-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome 11 years after an initial Bentall procedure for DeBakey type I dissection. The total arch and the descending thoracic aorta were replaced under deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest.
