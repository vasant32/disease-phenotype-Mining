Isolated spontaneous coronary artery dissections are rare and usually occur in women, the majority of whom are less than 40 years of age. Coronary artery dissection may also be caused by an extension of aortic dissection, especially in Marfan's syndrome. Iatrogenic coronary artery dissections are extremely rare, especially those secondary to coronary catheterization. The consequences of dissection may be fatal; therefore, early recognition and prompt therapy may be lifesaving.
