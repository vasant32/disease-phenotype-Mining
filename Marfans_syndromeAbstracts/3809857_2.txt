A 25-year-old patient and his sister had Marfan's syndrome and recurrent pressure neuropathy. Marfan's syndrome was inherited from their father while the neuropathy was inherited from their mother. Thus, the association of both disorders in the same patient was fortuitous. However it is suggested that the ligamentous hyperlaxity related to Marfan's syndrome may favour the occurrence of the neuropathy due to pressure.
