The Cabrol technique has been used to reimplant coronary arteries at the time of aortic root replacement. We describe a case of coronary stenosis after Cabrol procedure. A 42-year-old female with Marfan syndrome and chronic type B dissection who underwent aortic root replacement with Cabrol procedure complained of chest pain. Computed tomography( CT) showed extended thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm. Angiography revealed bilateral Cabrol limb stenosis at anastomotic sites. Re-do operation was performed under median re-sternotomy. Pannus around the coronary anastomosis was resected and patch extension using bovine pericardium was performed. Reconstruction of coronary arteries was completed by Piehler procedure and total arch replacement with elephant trunk technique was concomitantly performed. Post-operative course was uneventful. CT revealed the release from coronary stenosis.
