Complex aortic dissections with subsequent dilatation may be managed by using a visceral hybrid approach. In some cases, however, there is substantial retrograde blood flow into the false lumen, leaving a pressurized aneurysmal segment. The authors describe a novel treatment method whereby successful seal of a distal type 1 endoleak was achieved with coil embolization and a liquid injectable embolic agent. The patient was followed up for 2 years without further aortic dilatation or complications.
