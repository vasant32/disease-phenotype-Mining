 PURPOSE: To evaluate results of surgical complex treatment of lens dislocation in Marfan syndrome cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen eyes of 13 patients were operatively treated for lens dislocation. Pars plana vitrectomy was done in all eyes. Dislocated lenses were removed by lensectomy in 5 eyes and with an intracapsular method in 14 eyes. The scleral fixation technique was used for primary posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in 18 eyes, and one eye remained aphakic. Time of observation ranged between 6 and 71 months (mean 3.5 years). RESULTS: All eyes achieved improvement in visual acuity or good preoperative visual acuity was maintained. The vision between 6/6 and 6/8 was achieved in 14 patients. There were no serious intraoperative or early postoperative complications. Retinal detachment appeared in two eyes in a long observation time and it was successfully operatively treated. The not good visual results were due to amblyopia (n = 2), complications of retinal detachment surgery (n = 2) and glaucomatous optic disc atrophy coexisting with macular degeneration (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy and primary scleral-fixated IOL implantation gives quick and good visual rehabilitation in adult patients with Marfan's syndrome. The described surgical method is complex and need a prolonged operative time, but gives very good functional results and very few complications.
