 OBJECTIVES: There is little evidence in the medical literature about safety of PDA device closure and its effects on aortic root diameter in Marfan patients. We reported on nine Marfan patients whose ducts were occluded by coil or Amplatzer Duct Occluder. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Two patients had aneurismal type E ducts which were closed by a single coil, respectively. The others had conical ducts for which even Amplatzer occluder, stiff, or double coils were used. RESULTS: No untoward consequence was found during a median follow up period of 18.5 months (range 3 months to 6.33 years). Two patients had small residual shunts. The observed change in the mean ratio of aortic root diameter to its estimated value was statistically insignificant in seven patients who had complete data on their aortic root diameter before PDA closure and during the follow up. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that PDA device closure in Marfan patients is safe. Risk of residual shunt is higher even after closure of small ducts.
