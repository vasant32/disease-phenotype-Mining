We have found a new biological function of interferons, namely, their capacity to protect human cells from the action of some physical and chemical mutagens. To evaluate the protective effect of interferons the following criteria were applied: formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations (CA), as well as viability of cells and intensity of DNA repair synthesis. Pretreatment of cells with natural interferon decreased the number of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations, induced by different mutagens, and increased the intensity of DNA repair synthesis. This is attributed to the ability of interferon to enhance certain phases of DNA repair. In the case of photomutagenic action of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) on the lymphocytes, when monoadducts (MA) only, or both monoadducts and interstrand cross-links (ICL) are formed, the antimutagenic effect of interferon is exhibited only with respect to ICL. Unlike the natural interferon, the recombinant alpha 2-interferon failed to have any effect on the lymphocytes of clinically healthy donors exposed to gamma-radiation. In the repair- deficient cells (Marfan's syndrome) the protection of natural interferon against the action of 4-nitroquinoline-1'-oxide and gamma- radiation was found to be reduced significantly and that of alpha 2-interferon was not manifested at all. Thus, the capacity of interferons to alter the DNA repair, conceivably, depends on the type of interferon and on the cell genotype.
