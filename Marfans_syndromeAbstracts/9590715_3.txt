We present herein the case of a 39-year-old man found to have significant coarctation of the preductal aorta combined with a type B dissection, associated with Marfan's syndrome. This extremely rare pathological combination could be defined preoperatively only by a three-dimensional computed tomography scan. By means of selective cerebral perfusion, the coarctation was resected, and the total aortic arch was replaced with a Dacron graft.
