An 11-year-old girl who was diagnosed to have Marfan syndrome in her infancy, visited us with complaints of easy fatigability and chest discomfort. She was pointed out to have acute development of annuloaortic ectasia with severe aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. She underwent replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve using composite graft with prosthetic valve (Bentall's operation) and circular annuloplasty of the mitral valve. Bentall's operation for infants and children is remarkably rare because in this generation, acute development of aortic dilatation leading rupture and dissection is quite infrequent while main death is caused by mitral regurgitation.
