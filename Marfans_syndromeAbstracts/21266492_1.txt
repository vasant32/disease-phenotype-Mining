A 32-year-old female patient with Marfan syndrome was admitted for repair of annuloaortic ectasia and severe pectus excavatum. Because the chest cage deformity was severe, concomitant reparative surgery of the chest wall was performed. Partial median sternotomy and left second-fifth rib division was made to obtain good surgical field. The patient underwent valve-sparing aortic root remodeling successfully. After complete neutralization of heparin, additional division of the right ribs was performed and each rib and the sternum was reshaped. Pectus excavatum was completely repaired by this method. We believe this approach is efficacious for intracardiac repair with severe pectus excavatum.
