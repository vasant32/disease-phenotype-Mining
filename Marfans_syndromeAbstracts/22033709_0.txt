A 57-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome presented at our clinic with a whitish gelatinous corneal tumour in the right eye. The initial examination revealed pronounced corneal oedema, bullous keratopathy, as well as an iris-fixed anterior chamber lens implanted 7Â years previously. After the tumour was removed, the anterior chamber lens was explanted and keratoplasty was explanted and a two stage keratoplasty was performed. Histological analysis of the tumour and the cornea revealed vimentin and a number of smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive tumour cells. The cornea below the tumour displayed a partially absent Bowman's layer and extensive pannus tissue. The characteristics of the corneal tumour and the subjacent cornea as described above are typical of secondary corneal myxoma. The influence of Marfan syndrome, a systemic connective tissue disorder present in the patient, on the etiopathogenesis of the corneal myxoma could not be fully determined.
