OBJECTIVE: Most patients with annuloaortic ectasia are young. They are at risk for complications related to a lifetime of anticoagulation when composite grafts containing mechanical valves are used for reconstruction. The majority of patients have near normal valve cusps. Valve-preserving techniques have been developed to maintain valve function and avoid anticoagulation. The eddy currents occurring within the sinuses of Valsalva in the natural aortic root have been shown to be important in the smooth, gradual, and gentle closure of the valve. Compliance of the sinuses is important in reducing stress in the leaflets. A novel ascending aortic prosthesis with "built in" compliant sinuses (Robicsek-Thubrikar graft) was developed for clinical aortic root replacement. METHODS: Woven Dacron tubes were used to make the prostheses. Three precisely measured square pieces were cut to make the expandable, individual sinuses. Sewing the individual neo-sinuses to a scalloped end of the Dacron tube graft created the neo-sinotubular junction and sinotubular ridge. Five patients with annuloaortic ectasia underwent valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction. RESULTS: All intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic images after the valve-preserving procedure showed a normal appearing root with 10% radial expansion of each sinus in systole. The space between the cusps and neo-sinus wall in systole was normal. No patient has more than mild aortic regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: Valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction with a novel Dacron prosthesis with compliant "built in" sinuses re-establishes normal aortic root geometry with near normal valve motion. This may enhance the durability of the valve-preserving operation.
