A 37-year-old female with Marfan's syndrome developed myocardial infarction during a cardiac operation for annuloaortic ectasia and chronic dissecting aneurysm of the aorta. At autopsy, a chronic dissecting aneurysm of the left coronary arterial system (the left main stem, anterior descending branch, first diagonal branch, and circumflex branch) showing a true lumen and a pseudo lumen, which were patent, was found. There was also a hemorrhagic myocardial infarction of the anteroseptal wall and apical portion of the left ventricle.
