Composite valve graft replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve is indicated for a variety of conditions affecting the aortic root. However, a major drawback in this operation is bleeding from the proximal suture line and coronary anastomosis especially in patient with friable root tissue involved by aortic dissection. We describe here a modified technique to take advantage of the aortic button and cabrol techniques to reattach the coronary artery ostia. We have experienced seven patients with the aortic root replacements for type A dissection using the described technique over the past two years. In view of our favorable experience, we recommend this technique especially for patient with acute dissection involving nondilated aortic annulus, in addition to the patients with Marfan syndrome or annulo-aortic ectasia.
