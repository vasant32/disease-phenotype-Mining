 INTRODUCTION: Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a disease of microfibril dysfunction, has been associated with schizophrenia in multiple case reports. CASE REPORT: We present one case and review the literature that suggests these conditions may share a common etiologic pathway. DISCUSSION: A possible underlying mechanism of both schizophrenia and MFS is the abnormal expression of growth factors and signaling cascades. CONCLUSION: MFS patients should be monitored for psychiatric symptoms and patients with signs of MFS should be referred for appropriate medical care. Also, by understanding shared mechanisms, we may develop better understanding and treatments.
