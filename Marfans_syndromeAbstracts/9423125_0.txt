We reoperated twenty-four times upon twenty cases of dissecting aortic aneurysm since 1983. Nine of them (45%) were Marfan patients. Reoperations on the same part of the aorta as the prior procedure was done 15 times upon 13 cases with six hospital deaths (40%). Reoperations on the different part of the aorta from the prior operation was done 9 times on 9 cases with one hospital death (11%). Over all hospital mortality rate was 29%. The hospital mortality rate for Marfan patients (8%) was significantly better than that for non-Marfan patients (50%).
