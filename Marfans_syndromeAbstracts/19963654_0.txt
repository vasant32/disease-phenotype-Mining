In this paper we reported a novel method to detect and quantify dural ectasia in Marfan syndrome. Firstly, the dural sacs of 8 Marfan patients were segmented by applying an unsupervised Fuzzy C-Means method on T2-weighed magnetic resonance images. Then, for each patient a tubular model of the dural sac was extracted by detecting and removing the existent pathological extrusions. The segmented images together with the resulting tube were then rendered using a marching cubes algorithm. The proposed algorithm represents a first attempt to quantify and to morphologically characterize the pathological ectasia that usually accompanies the Marfan disorder. The generated 3D reconstruction and the opportunity to overlap them with a physiological model provides the clinician with a tool for a panoramic view of the structures and a means for a more accurate inspection of ectasia. In addition the extracted parameters furnish quantitative and reproducible measures that could be useful as discriminative indexes for an automatic and more objective diagnosis.
