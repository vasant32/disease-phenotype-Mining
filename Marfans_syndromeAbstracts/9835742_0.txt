BACKGROUND: The ectodermal hypohidrotic dysplasia, Marfan and Robinson syndromes are hereditary syndromes. They are characterized by teeth anomalies associated with system anomalies. The purpose of the present study is an analysis of single dental anomaly cases in personally observed syndromes. METHODS: The dental arch radiographs of 8 patients suffering from hereditary syndromes characterized by teeth anomalies have been studied. These dental anomalies have been classified--from an anatomic-clinical viewpoint--as to number (missing/exceeding teeth), shape, position, volume (too much/too little), eruption (early/late, till inclusion) and structure (enamel, dentine, cement). For each syndrome, the kind of transmission, the kind of dental anomaly (isolated or associated), the prevailing, the kind of association among the various dental anomalies have been evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently observed anomaly among the examined syndromes has been the number associated to shape. The 95.4% of the specimen presented association between different dental anomalies. The results of the observation confirm the well documented ontogenetic and etiopathogenetic relationship between genetics, dental genesis, morphogenesis, teeth eruption and growth. Dental anomalies observation should direct the surgeon towards considering the presence of other signs and symptoms when tracing out probable and more complex--sometimes recessive--syndrome outlines.
