 BACKGROUND: Extracellular matrix remodeling in the aortic wall results in increased aortic stiffness (AoS) in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Pulsed-wave velocity (PWV) constitutes the best indirect AoS measurement. We aimed to assess PWV in MFS patients using two-dimensional (2D) and Doppler echocardiography. METHODS: Thirty-one MFS patients, (mean age 31 Â± 14 years, 16 men) and 31 controls were examined. Blood flow was recorded in the aorta near the aortic valve and immediately after in the descending aorta with simultaneous electrocardiography. PWV was calculated by dividing the distance between the two sample volume positions (D) by the time difference (TD) between the intervals from the QRS start to the ascending and descending aortic flow onsets. B-stiffness was also measured. RESULTS: TD (described in "Methods" section) and, aortic arch length were significantly increased in MFS patients, P < 0.001. Thus, PWV values were significantly higher in patients when compared with controls, 7.20 m/s (5.12, 9.43) versus 4.64 m/s (3.37, 6.24), P < 0.001. B-stiffness was also significantly increased in MFS patients; 5.15 (3.69, 7.65) versus 2.44 (1.82, 3.66), P < 0.001. Multiple regression analysis showed a positive association with MFS diagnosis and age, (P = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively). Reproducibility of PWV measurements was <5%. CONCLUSIONS: AoS was significantly higher in MFS patients as expected. Our data demonstrated that PWV measurements can be performed, in the absence of serious musculoskeletal abnormalities in MFS adults, as part of a cardiac ultrasound scan. This technique can be helpful in diagnosis and management in MFS.
