The Ross procedure has been used increasingly to treat aortic valve disease in children and young adults. The primary indication for the Ross procedure is to provide a permanent valve replacement in children with congenital aortic stenosis. More recently, it has been extended to young adults with a bicuspid aortic valve and small aortic annulus, especially women wishing to have children. Other possible indications include complex left ventricular outflow obstructive disease, native or prosthetic valve endocarditis, and adult aortic insufficiency with a dilated aortic annulus. Conversely, Marfan syndrome is considered to an absolute contraindication, and this procedure should be used with caution in patients with rheumatic valve disease and a dysplastic dilated aortic root because of the higher associated incidence of autograft dysfunction. The technique of total aortic root replacement has become the preferred method of autograft implantation, because it carries the lowest risk of pulmonary autograft failure. In patients with marked graft-host size mismatch, either concomitant aortic annulus reduction and fixation or aortic annulus enlargement (i.e., the Ross-Konno procedure) should be performed. The Ross Procedure International Registry data document that in the modern era (post-1986) the early and late mortality rate is 2.5% and 1%, respectively. Excellent long-term results have been reported, and the benefits of this procedure include optimal hemodynamics, low risk of endocarditis, resistance to infection in patients with active endocarditis, and nonthrombogeneicity and therefore few anticoagulation-related complications. The Ross procedure can be performed with acceptable early and mid-term mortality and excellent autograft durability. Further long-term follow-up will confirm the role of this procedure in patients with various types of aortic valve disease.
