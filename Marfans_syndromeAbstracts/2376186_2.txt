Tracheobronchomegaly is a distinct clinical and radiologic entity characterized by marked dilatation of the trachea and bronchi. In this report we describe a Marfanoid patient who developed TBM in his adulthood with rapid deterioration, leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure. This case represents an acquired form of TBM in a patient with Marfanoid features which has not been previously described. Tracheobronchomegaly should be considered as a cause of chronic respiratory failure in a young adult and can be diagnosed easily with chest roentgenogram and CAT scan.
