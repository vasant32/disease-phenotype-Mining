Combined therapy of stent graft implantation and open surgery is an alternative method for aortic aneurysm. Seven patients with aortic aneurysm [annulo aortic ectasia (AAE) + Marfan syndrome (4), AAE + arch aneurysm + s/o Beh√ßet disease (1), acute dissected aneurysm (type A) (1), thoracic aortic true aneurysm (1)] were successfully treated by means of elephant trunk method using a stent graft during total arch replacement. There was no complication related to the stent graft during the perioperative period. Postoperative computed tomographic scans were performed 1 and 6 months later. There was no endleak and no migration, and the aortic diameter around the stent graft was not changed in six patients. However, one patient showed thrombus around the stent graft, because of endleak 2 months after the operation. Such patients should therefore have careful long-term follow-up.
