This is the first description of a patient with Marfan syndrome and an aneurysm of the ventricular septum. Apart from a borderline dilatation of the ascending aorta, there were no cardiovascular manifestations of Marfan syndrome. A transesophageal echocardiographic examination showed a large aneurysm of the ventricular septum. To prevent the imminent rupture and the acute occurrence of a significant left-to-right-shunt on the ventricular level, as well as increasing irritation of tricuspid valve, an elective operation was performed. Besides the routine cardiological diagnostics, the search for intracardial defects is also necessary in patients with Marfan syndrome.
