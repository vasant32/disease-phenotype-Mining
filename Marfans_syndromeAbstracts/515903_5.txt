A case of intracavernous giant aneurysm associated with Marfan's syndrome is reported. The patient was treated with a superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass and a ligation of the internal carotid artery in the neck. Although they are common in aorta and pulmonary artery, the vascular abnormalities in Marfan's syndrome are very rarely reported in intracranial arteries. The patient also had an aberrant internal carotid artery which presented as a red mass behind the eardrum.
