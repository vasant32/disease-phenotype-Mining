 BACKGROUND: An anterior sacral meningocele is a rare form of spinal dysraphism that is sometimes associated with syndromes such as Currarino and Marfan syndromes. These lesions rarely cause neurological complications, but meningitis, sepsis, obstetric problems, and bowel and bladder difficulties are common secondary conditions. The lesions can even be fatal. Because these lesions usually do not regress spontaneously, surgical treatment is the standard for symptomatic or growing masses. The dural defect can be repaired with a variety of anterior or posterior approaches. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 16-year-old female patient with a giant nonsyndromic anterior sacral meningocele that we successfully treated using an open anterior approach. We discuss the treatment options and present a brief review of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Although the posterior approach remains the treatment of choice for most lesions, we believe that the anterior laparotomy provides excellent exposure and is a safe alternative approach for the treatment of selected lesions. Patients with these lesions should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team.
