Between 1974 and July 1989 110 operations for thoracic aortic aneurysms in 107 patients (69 males, 38 females) were performed, whose ages ranged from 14 to 74. 37 patients had an aortic valvular disease, 15 had Marfan's syndrome, 28 of these patients had a history of thoracic trauma or of previous aortic or cardiac surgery (14 posttraumatic aneurysms, 9 aneurysms after cardiac surgery, 5 after repair of aortic coarctation), 29 patients had hypertension. 63 patients underwent repair of dissecting aneurysms, 47 of non-dissecting (saccular or fusiform) thoracic aortic aneurysms. 67 repairs were emergency and 43 elective. The hospital mortality for the entire series was 34.5%. The analysis of multiple preoperative and intraoperative variables showed that mortality following thoracic aortic aneurysm repair is higher with increasing age (65.7% mortality for operations between the 60th and 70th year of age, 100% mortality beyond the 70th year of age) and emergency surgery (hospital mortality 52.2% compared with 6.9% for elective operations). A significant increase in mortality was noted related to the aneurysm type (poorer prognosis in DeBakey type I and II), to history of hypertension, to preoperative shock or to perforation of the aneurysm, including haemopericardium or haemothorax.
