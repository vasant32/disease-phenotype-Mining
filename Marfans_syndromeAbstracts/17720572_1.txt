Ectopia lentis is almost always a bilateral condition, although it may be asymmetric in some cases of Marfan syndrome. Unilateral ectopia lentis has been associated with trauma and with intraocular tumors. We report two siblings with isolated unilateral ectopia lentis who had no evidence of underlying abnormality or of trauma.
