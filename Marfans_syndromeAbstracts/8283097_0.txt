We reported a rare case of mitral valve aneurysm. The patient was a 67-year-old woman with regurgitation of mitral and aortic valve due to infective endocarditis. Preoperative two-dimensional echocardiogram revealed a aneurysmal change and prolapsing on anterior mitral leaflet. Left ventriculogram showed mitral regurgitation of Sellers IV. She underwent mitral valve replacement with 27 mm Carbo Medicus prosthesis successfully. There was a perforated valvular aneurysm (21 x 15 x 11 mm) and inflammatory cleft on anterior mitral leaflet at histopathological findings. The pathogenesis of mitral valve aneurysm was generally infective endocarditis and rarely congenital anomaly, syphylis, Aortitis syndrome, or Marfan syndrome. Mitral valve replacement was a procedure of choice for mitral valve aneurysm, which is especially large, perforated and severely inflammatory one.
