 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical efficiency and safety of the iris hooks and modified capsular tension ring (MCTR) for the treatment of subluxation lens in patients with Marfan's syndrome. METHODS: This study comprised 5 patients (7 eyes) with Marfan's syndrome and subluxation lens. After 3.2 mm clear cornea incision and continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), 2 - 4 disposable nylon iris hooks were inserted through the stab incisions and placed in the capsulorhexis to support the capsule and enlarged the CCC. Following irrigation/aspiration, a MCTR with suture in its eyelet was placed in the capsule bag. After tightening and tying the suture of MCTR, the capsular bag was centered and fixed. A foldable AcrySof one-piece intraocular lens (IOL) was then placed in the capsule bag. RESULTS: Twelve months after the operation, the best corrected visual acuity was >/= 0.8 in six eyes and 0.7 in one eye. The scheimpflug images obtained from the Pentacam demonstrated that the IOL were well centered. UBM showed that all the MCTR and the haptics of the IOL were in the capsule bag, the eyelet of the MCTR was rested stably between the capsulorhexis margin and the iris. The retroillumination photograph indicated that only one eye had obvious posterior capsular opacification. No intraoperative and postoperative complications such as prolapse of vitreous and retina detachment was occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The iris hooks can provide excellent intraoperative capsule-lens stability and facilitate the manipulation during operation. MCTR allows additional suture fixation to the eye wall without damaging the capsular bag and maintains the long-term stability of the intraocular lens. Furthermore, MCTR is helpful for avoiding dislocation of the IOL due to progressive weakening of the zonular fibers in some patients and provides long-term safety.
