A 12-year-old girl with an otherwise typical Marfan syndrome (Ghent criteria fulfilled) presented with highly unusual oral manifestations consisting of supernumerary teeth and severe dental crowding. Pathological examination of the supernumerary teeth revealed an elevated number of pulpoliths. No mutation in the FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes was identified despite exhaustive screening, suggesting that another gene defect could explain this association of marfanoid features with dental abnormalities.
