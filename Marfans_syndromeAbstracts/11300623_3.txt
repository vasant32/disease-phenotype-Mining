Aortic dissection and rupture make the Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most highly lethal genetic condition, but these events are preceded by simple aortic root dilatation over a long period. A hydrogel coated angioplasty balloon might constitute a possible aortic vector to locally deliver an antisense Mg-dependent hammerhead ribozyme capable to control specifically the genetic alteration of fibrillin 1 responsible for the connective tissue disorder of MFS.
