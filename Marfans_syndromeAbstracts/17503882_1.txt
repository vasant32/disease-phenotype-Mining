The cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome (MFS) remain the primary source of morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Over the last decade, the underlying pathogenesis of these cardiovascular abnormalities has been the focus of much research. Such research has shed light on the potential role of several novel medical therapies and their ability to prevent cardiovascular disease progression. This paper summarizes the research underlying new medical therapies and provides a review of the scientific foundation underlying all current medical therapies used for prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with MFS, including beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor antagonists.
