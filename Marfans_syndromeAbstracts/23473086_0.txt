OBJECTIVES: To evaluate visual outcomes in patients treated for lens subluxation. Secondary objectives are to report best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in LogMAR and compare the outcomes of patients managed conservatively with those treated surgically. METHODS: Retrospective comparison of BCVA in patients under 50 years-old with lens subluxation, managed conservatively or surgically. RESULTS: A total of 49 eyes of 28 patients were included. Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups. Twenty eyes were treated surgically (40.8%) compared to 29 with medical treatment (59.2%). Marfan syndrome (79.6%) was diagnosed in 39 eyes. LogMAR BCVA post intervention was 0.35±0.31 for medical treatment and 0.39±0.32 for the surgical group, with no significant differences (P=.63). Improvements in LogMAR lines were 2.7±4.2 and 4.11±4.2 (P=.35), respectively. Two eyes in the surgery group developed ocular hypertension (0.04%), none with retinal detachment. CONCLUSIONS: The final BCVA showed no significant differences in this group of patients. BCVA depends on the visual potential of the rehabilitated eye rather than a specific type of intervention.
