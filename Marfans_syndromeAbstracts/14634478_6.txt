Marfan syndrome is 1 of the commonest inherited connective tissue disorders. Sudden death may occur and is usually attributed to cardiovascular manifestations of the syndrome. Atlantoaxial hypermobility, increased odontoid height, and rotatory subluxation are well described in this syndrome, but this paper details what seems to be the first reported case of sudden and unexpected death due to spontaneous atlantoaxial subluxation in Marfan syndrome.
