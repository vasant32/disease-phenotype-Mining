In 112 eyes of 65 patients a clear lens in the Marfan's syndrome was removed through the approach in the flat part of the ciliary body. Before operation, in all patients who had peripheral degeneration of the retina peripheral prophylactic argon laser coagulation of the retina was made. At the time of operation, in 12 eyes some pieces of lenticular substance penetrated into anterior segments of the vitreous body, which in all cases was removed by means of a lens vitreotome. One month after lensectomy, in 1 patient retinal detachment developed that totally reattached after surgical intervention. In 99 eyes (88.4%) visual acuity improved after surgery as compared with that before surgery. The analysis of the obtained results has shown that transciliary lensectomy is a reliable method of surgical treatment for subluxation of a clear lens in the Marfan's syndrome.
