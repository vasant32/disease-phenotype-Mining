 BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety, reproducibility and pitfalls of an aortic valve re-implantation (AVRei) technique. METHODS: From June 2005 to December 2008, 30 patients underwent aortic valve-sparing re-implantation with Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis. Mean age was 66 +/- 7 years (range 47-81). Mean aortic root diameter was 49 +/- 6 mm (range 37-70) and 12 patients had an aortic insufficiency more than 2+. All the patients were elective, except three who underwent surgery for type A aortic dissection. Two patients had Marfan syndrome and one had a bicuspid aortic valve. Isolated aortic root replacement was performed in 26 patients, whereas hemiarch extension was required in four. All the survivors underwent serial echocardiographic assessment for functional results and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) for aortic root morphology evaluation. RESULTS: There was one early death and one re-exploration for bleeding. Two patients suffered from a perioperative stroke and four required a pacemaker implantation because of a complete atrio-ventricular block. Mean follow-up was 12 +/- 10 months (range 1-42) with no late deaths, whereas freedom from reoperation was 100% and freedom from aortic insufficiency 2+ or more was 96.5%. MDCT aortic root reconstruction showed a pseudo-normalization of the neo-sinuses of Valsalva mimicking the human normal aortic root morphology. CONCLUSION: AVRei with Valsalva conduit is a well-tolerated procedure both in elective and emergency situations. In well-selected patients, good functional and clinical results can be achieved, regardless of the cause of the aortic root disease. Application of simple surgical manoeuvres allows durable clinical efficacy to be obtained without the risk of major complications.
