After reviewing the main features of the Marfan syndrome (musculoskeletal, ocular, cardiovascular, pulmonary abnormalities), its autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance but variable phenotype and presence of "soft" conditions preventing an easy diagnosis, the authors report their own data relevant to 73 probands: ratio of each clinical manifestation, state of 34% of familial cases and display of a paternal age effect in the sporadic cases. The pathogenic defect is unknown as like the location of the gene. The difficulties of the genetic counseling are then approached: unpredictability of the severity and of the prognosis in the unborn children of an affected patient, benefit of the echocardiography in the management of people at risk.
