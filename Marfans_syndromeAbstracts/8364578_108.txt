Marfan syndrome results from mutations in an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, fibrillin. Previous studies have characterized approximately 6.9-kb of the estimated 10-kb fibrillin transcript. We have now completed the primary structure of fibrillin, elucidated the exon/intron organization of the gene and derived a physical map of the genetic locus. Pre-fibrillin consists of 2,871 amino acids which, excluding the signal peptide, are arranged into five structurally distinct regions. The largest of these regions comprises about 75% of the entire protein and consists of numerous repeated cysteine-rich sequences homologous to the peptide motifs of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-beta binding protein (TGF-bp). Forty-three of the forty-six EGF-like repeats contain a calcium binding consensus sequence (EGF-CB) conceivably mediating protein-protein interactions. Fibrillin exhibits a few additional cysteine-rich modules that are apparently unique to this macromolecule and may represent evolutionary variants of the EGF-CB and TGF-bp motifs. Almost all of the cysteine-rich repeats are encoded by single exons; consequently, the fibrillin gene is relatively large (approximately 110-kb) and highly fragmented (65 exons). This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the fibrillin gene and relevant information for the full characterization of Marfan syndrome mutations.
