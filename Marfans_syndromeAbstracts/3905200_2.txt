Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) have become primary methods of evaluating patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Arteriography may be necessary for further assessment. We have recently investigated two patients with complicated abdominal aortic aneurysms, one patient with Marfan's syndrome and the other with Behcet's disease. The initial diagnosis in both cases was made by ultrasound, but CT was inconclusive and aortography was contraindicated in both patients. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging was performed to see if further information could be obtained. This technique was useful in both cases, with elegant demonstration of the anatomy.
