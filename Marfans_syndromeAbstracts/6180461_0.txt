Collagen is a macro-molecule of polypeptide chains arranged in a triple helix. The biosynthesis and degradation of collagen require complex enzymes systems; considerable progress has been made in their understanding in recent years. Collagen is the most important connective tissue of the body and five types are present in the lower respiratory tract. Genetic disorders of collagen (e.g. the Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan's syndrome) may affect the lung. Furthermore certain pulmonary diseases such as fibrosis are associated with changes in the ratio of the different types of collagen. Collagen can no longer be dissociated from the study of tissue changes in pulmonary pathology; the aim of our study is to provide elementary data concerning this aspect of modern pneumology.
