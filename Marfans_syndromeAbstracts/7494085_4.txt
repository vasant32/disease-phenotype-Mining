BACKGROUND: Previous theories of the pathogenesis of keratoconus have only described partial aspects of the disease. METHODS: Studies are reviewed that have demonstrated a statistical and physiological relation between keratoconus, magnesium deficiency, type A behavior, and allergy, which constitute the Thalasselis Syndrome. RESULTS: The Thalasselis syndrome integrates old and new theories on keratoconus, mitral valve prolapse, and tetany/menopause. Keratoconus is also associated with genetic diseases like Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and other conditions related to collagen disturbance and biochemical abnormalities in protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: This syndrome suggests that the genetic disturbance that causes these alterations could be influenced by metabolic factors in which magnesium deficiency could be involved.
