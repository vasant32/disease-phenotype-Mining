Nine syndromes associated with varying patterns of abnormal physical growth were selected to study quantitative craniofacial dysmorphology with cephalometric analysis. A schematic diagram was developed in which a hexagon measures the neurocranium and facial skeletal size and form. This hexagon offers the possibility of quantitative dysmorphic roentgencephalometry to study the effects of various growth disorders on the craniofacial complex.
