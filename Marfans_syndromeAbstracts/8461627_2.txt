Adult polycystic kidney disease is frequently associated with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular abnormalities. These include hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, mild dilation of the aortic root, abdominal aneurysms, and predisposition to aortic, mitral, and tricuspidal valve regurgitation reminiscent of Marfan's syndrome. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of adult polycystic kidney disease are not well established, a generalized defect of collagen structure is hypothesized. The most severe vascular problems, however, are typical intracranial aneurysms with a high incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a high mortality rate. We report a case of dilated coronary arteries found incidentally in a patient with adult polycystic kidney disease and stress-induced angina pectoris. The typical angina pectoris of the patient is explained by left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary heart disease. Multiple liver cysts, mitral valve prolapse, and the coronary aneurysms in this patient with adult polycystic kidney disease appear to reflect the manifestation of a generalized connective tissue disorder in this syndrome.
