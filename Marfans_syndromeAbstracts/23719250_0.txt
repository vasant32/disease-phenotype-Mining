We report a case of acute aortic dissection (Stanford type B) that occurred in pregnant woman at 34-week gestation. She had no systemic characteristics of Marfan syndrome, however she exhibited a mutation of FBN1, Arg 545 Cys, which has been found to correlate with ectopia lentis but not with aortic dissection.
