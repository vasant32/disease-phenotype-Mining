 BACKGROUND: Long term results of four different operative procedures for the treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms were investigated either performed by short venous or segmental alloplastic interpositions or long femoro-popliteal below the knee bypass using alloplastic grafts or autologous vein. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 47 patients treated for 50 popliteal aneurysms (mean diameter +/- SD: 3.5 +/- 1.1 cm) were analyzed (follow-up: 40.2 +/- 4.9 months). RESULTS: Primary patency rate was 78% and secondary patency rate was 86% at 5 years. Frequency of operative reinterventions was higher in patients treated for acute ischemia and in patients treated with alloplastic interpositions or alloplastic bypass (p = 0.026). Secondary patency rates were higher in patients treated with autologous venous interpositions or venous femoro-popliteal bypass (p = 0.022). Times of secondary vascular patency were significantly shorter for patients treated with short alloplastic interpositions in comparison to long alloplastic femoro-popliteal bypass procedures, short venous interpositions or long venous bypass operations (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of patients with popliteal aneurysms autologous venous interposition is therefore recommended or as an alternative venous or alloplastic femoro-popliteal below the knee bypass.
