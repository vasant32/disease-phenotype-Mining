Left ventricular dimensions and systolic function were studied using echocardiography in 234 patients with Marfan's syndrome without significant valvular regurgitation. Left ventricular dimensions and systolic function were found to be normal in most patients with Marfan's syndrome. Some involvement of the left ventricle may have been present in a small group of these patients. No patients, however, fulfilled the criteria for dilated cardiomyopathy.
