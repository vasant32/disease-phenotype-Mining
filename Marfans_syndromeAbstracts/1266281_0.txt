Three different forms of aortic lesions in Marfan's Syndrome are demonstrated: 1. moderately severe aortic valve insufficiency due to sinus of Valsalva aneurysm; 2. severe aortic valve insufficiency due to aneurysmal widening of the ascending aorta; 3. an unusually wide dissecting aneurysm extending from the aortic root to the aortic bifurcation. A review of the current literature of the changes in Marfan's Syndrome is given. It is obvious that early diagnosis of the cardiovascular changes is important for the patient's prognosis, allowing the optimal time for surgical intervention to be chosen.
