Optimal surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation in the Marfan syndrome (valve repair versus replacement) is controversial because the underlying connective tissue defect theoretically might compromise repair durability. To examine the results of mitral valve repair in these patients, we did a retrospective review of 160 patients with the Marfan syndrome who had cardiac surgical procedures between January 1983 and January 1993. Thirty-six patients had mitral procedures, 29 of which were repairs. Mitral valve replacement was necessary in seven patients because of extensive annular calcification and/or severe anterior leaflet abnormalities. The 18 men and 11 women undergoing mitral valve repair had a mean age of 26.5 +/- 2.6 years (range 9 months to 54 years); seven patients were less than 18 years of age. Twenty-four of the 29 patients had concomitant aortic root replacement because of aortic dilation or valvular insufficiency. All 29 repairs included annuloplasty, and 11 patients also required leaflet resection. There were no operative deaths. At mean follow-up of 26.6 +/- 4.8 months, there have been three late deaths, two caused by arrhythmia and one by complications of type III aortic dissection. All survivors are in New York Heart Association class I or II. In three patients recurrent mitral regurgitation developed (grade III or IV); 5-year actuarial freedom from significant mitral regurgitation was 88.3%. One patient required repeat mitral annuloplasty after endocarditis of the composite aortic graft spread to the mitral valve. No patient required late mitral valve replacement. These results demonstrate that (1) 22% of patients with the Marfan syndrome who undergo cardiac operation require a mitral valve procedure, (2) most can be treated by mitral repair rather than replacement, and (3) at early follow-up, results of mitral repair in this population are satisfactory.
