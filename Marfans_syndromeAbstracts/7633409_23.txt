The Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of connective tissue. Variable and pleiotropic clinical features are observed in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. The most severe end of the phenotypic spectrum of this disorder comprises a group of patients usually diagnosed at birth, who have a life expectancy of little more than a year. To distinguish this group of patients from those with classical MFS, we refer to them as neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS). These infants usually die of congestive heart failure rather than aortic aneurysmal disease, the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in classical MFS. Defects in fibrillin, an elastin-associated microfibrillar glycoprotein, are now known to cause both the classical and neonatal forms of MFS. Here we report the recurrent mis-splicing of fibrillin (FBN1) exon 32, a precursor EGF-like calcium binding domain, in two unrelated infants with nMFS. The mis-splicing, in one patient, was due to an A-->T transversion at the -2 position of the consensus acceptor splice site; while that in the second patient was caused by a G-->A transition at the +1 position of the donor splice site. Characterization of FBN1 mutations in individuals at the most severe end of the Marfan syndrome spectrum should provide greater understanding of the multiple domains and regions of fibrillin.
