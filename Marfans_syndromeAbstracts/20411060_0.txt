 BACKGROUND: Marfan Syndrome occurs in 8 to 10 per 100,000 of population/year. Ocular features of this syndrome have been extensively reported. We report two patients in the same family with miscellaneous complications of this syndrome. CASE REPORT: Two sisters with Marfan Syndrome were examined in our clinic. They revealed severe ocular complications as bilateral spontaneous complete posterior lens dislocation, total rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and secondary glaucoma. Combined surgical and conservative treatment was applied to both cases with relative successful results. They were also referred to cardiologist for further evaluation and management. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular complications commonly occur in Marfan's Syndrome. Total rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, secondary glaucoma, etc. These findings require prompt and aggressive treatment to minimize visual loss in these patients.
