A retrospective review of pneumothoraces in children presenting to a major tertiary children's hospital is described. A total of 35 cases in 31 patients of spontaneous pneumothorax were identified over a 10-year period. There was one case of bilateral pneumothorax and three cases of recurrent pneumothoraces. Twenty-four cases (69%) required intercostal tube catheter drainage for a mean of 4.9 days (range 2-10 days). Eleven cases, including two cases in CF patients, and three cases in patients with Marfan's Syndrome proceeded to a secondary surgical procedure after a continuing air leak was present for an average of 5.9 days (range 2-16 days). In follow-up studies on 11 cases, 5 (45%) were found to have apical abnormalities of the lung on CT scanning. Pneumothoraces were identified in six cases of patients with cystic fibrosis as well as four in patients with Marfan's Syndrome. This present study has suggested that unless intercostal catheter treatment resolves the air leak associated with a spontaneous pneumothorax within 5 days that surgical intervention is most likely to be required to achieve a full resolution.
