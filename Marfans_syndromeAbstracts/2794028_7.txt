Between 1974 and 1985, 461 patients with pectus excavatum and 135 patients with pectus carinatum underwent operative repair of their anterior chest wall deformities. Twenty-one percent of patients with anterior chest wall deformity had mild scoliosis by clinical and radiographic examination. The average lateral spinal deformity was 15 degrees (range 6-78 degrees) for pectus excavatum patients and 16 degrees (range 5-57 degrees) for pectus carinatum patients. Eighteen percent of the pectus excavatum patients with scoliosis and 14% of the pectus carinatum patients with scoliosis required therapeutic intervention of bracing and/or arthrodesis.
