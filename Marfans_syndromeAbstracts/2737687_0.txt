Aneurysm of ascending aorta with aortic valve incompetence is a formidable pathological entity having a relentless course. Etiological factors include syphilitic aortitis, dissection of aorta, Marfan's syndrome and similar conditions. With the advance in operative technique and extra corporeal circulation, now it is possible to treat these conditions by surgery. Surgical intervention includes replacement of entire ascending aorta along with aortic valve by an artificial valve conduit. Basically, two procedures are described, namely, the conventional method and Bentall's operation, both involving a great technique challenge. Our experience with both these techniques is being described in four consecutive cases in the last one year.
