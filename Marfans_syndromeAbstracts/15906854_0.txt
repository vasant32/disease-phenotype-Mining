DNA repair synthesis (RS) was investigated in lymphocytes of healty donors and repair-deficient cells (Marfan's syndrome), treated with inhibitor of superoxidedismutase (SOD)--TRIEN--after gamma-irradiation. Significant difference was revealed in cells of healthy donors and Marfan's syndrome: in cells of healthy donors TRIEN stimulated DNA RS whereas this effect didn't observed in Marfan's syndrome cells. So it is possible to suppose that SOD activity is different in normal and gamma-repair-deficient cells.
