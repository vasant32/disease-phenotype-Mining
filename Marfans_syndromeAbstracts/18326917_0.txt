 OBJECTIVE: To summarize the experience of clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment of ascending aortic aneurysm. METHODS: The clinical data of 72 cases of ascending aortic aneurysm were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 72 cases, 36 suffered Mafanos syndrome, 35 suffered aortic dissection, and 1 multiple aortic pseudo-aneurysm. All the patients received artificial vessel replacement or repair under middle or low temperature of cardiopulmonary bypass. Two patients received coronary artery bypass grafting, 2 received aortic valve replacement,and 1 received artificial patch repair. RESULTS: Eight patients died and the others recovered without nervous system complications and were discharged. CONCLUSION: Expedient confirmatory diagnosis, prompt surgical therapy, and efficient therapy during the peri-operative period are helpful to achieve a successful outcome.
