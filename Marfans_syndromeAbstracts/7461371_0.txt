The Authors report a case of aneurysm of the ascending aorta in Marfan syndrome, with fatal outcome (2 months after the onset of the symptoms), caused neither by dissection nor by rupture of the aorta, but by serious myocardial involvement due to anoxic damage and acute volume overload of left ventricle. The Authors describe the possible mechanisms of this evolution and point out the usefulness of the identification of this uncommon evolution for a useful and opportune surgical therapy.
