Thirteen patients with Marfan's syndrome who underwent surgery between 1968 and 1983 were studied to document the anaesthetic morbidity in this rare disorder. One of the 13 patients studied died intra-operatively, one died in the immediate postoperative period and one patient developed postoperative complications and further surgery was postponed indefinitely. This represents a high mortality/morbidity rate and the findings are recorded. The two deaths were unexpected and could not be explained.
