Chest pain and chest wall deformities are common in children. Although most children with chest pain have a benign diagnosis, some have a serious etiology for pain, so the complaint must be addressed carefully. Unfortunately, there are few prospective studies to evaluate this complaint in children. Serious causes for chest pain are rare, making it difficult to develop clear guidelines for evaluation and management. The child who appears well, has a normal physical examination, and lacks worrisome history deserves reassurance and careful follow-up rather than extensive studies. Multicenter studies are needed to better define this important symptom.
