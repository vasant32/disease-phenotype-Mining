Aortic dissection (AD) is an uncommon condition that occurs mainly in the older patient population (>40 years). It is rare in younger people and is usually associated with trauma, Marfan's syndrome, or pregnancy. We report a case of a young weightlifter who died from an AD, and upon autopsy, was diagnosed as having non-Marfan's fibrillinopathy. We recommend that AD should be considered in symptomatic patients with any family history of early cardiac deaths, a history suggestive of a connective tissue disorder (that is, multiple joint surgeries) or who practise weightlifting.
