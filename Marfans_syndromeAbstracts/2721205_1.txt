The authors describe experience gained with surgical treatment of dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta in the period from 1978 to 1987. 30 patients were operated on using the techniques proposed by Bentall, De Bono and Carbrol. All patients exhibited the presence of annulo-aortic ectasia. Hospital mortality in the past four years was 20%. On the basis of an analysis of immediate and late results the authors come to the conclusion that Bentall's, De Bono's and Cabrol's technique is the method of choice for surgical corrections of annulo-aortic ectasia and Marfan's syndrome.
