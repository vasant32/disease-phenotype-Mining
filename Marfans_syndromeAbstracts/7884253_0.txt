Composite graft replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve has been indicated for aortic regurgitation (AR) associated with annulo aortic ectasia (AAE). 29-year-old female with AR due to AAE associated with Marfan's syndrome underwent the replacement of ascending aorta by sparing an aortic valve with good result. Under cardiopulmonary bypass, the proximal ascending aorta was dissected circumferentially down to the ventriculo-aortic junction. The aneurysmal aorta and the all three sinuses of valsalva were excised, leaving 7 mm of arterial wall attached to the aortic valve and small buttons of arterial wall around the both left and right coronary arteries. The aortic valve was reimplanted inside a 28 mm Dacron graft which was calculated by aortic valve leaflet height. The left coronary artery was reimplanted to the graft by interposing a short 10 mm Dacron graft between coronary ostia and graft and the right coronary artery was anastomosed directly to the graft (Piehler's procedure). We called these procedure "modified David's operation". The patient has survived the operative procedure without any complications. Postoperative aortogram showed a competent aortic valve and the peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve was 20 mmHg. We believe this new procedure preserving the native aortic valve is useful for preventing from some complications associated with artificial heart valves.
