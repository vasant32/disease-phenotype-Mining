BACKGROUND: In patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS), increased aortic wall stiffening may lead to progressive aortic dilatation. Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV), a marker of wall stiffness can be assessed regionally, using in-plane multi-directional velocity-encoded MRI. This study examined the diagnostic accuracy of regional PWV for prediction of regional aortic luminal growth during 2-year follow-up in MFS patients. METHODS: In twenty-one MFS patients (mean age 36±15years, 11 male) regional PWV and aortic luminal areas were assessed by 1.5T MRI. At 2-year follow-up, the incidence of luminal growth, defined as mean luminal diameter increase >2mm was determined for five aortic segments (S1, ascending aorta; S2, aortic arch; S3, thoracic descending aorta, S4, supra-renal and S5, infra-renal abdominal aorta). Regional PWV at baseline was considered increased when exceeding age-related normal PWV (healthy volunteers (n=26; mean age 30±10years, 15 male)) by two standard-errors. Sensitivity and specificity of regional PWV-testing for prediction of regional luminal growth were determined. RESULTS: Regional PWV at baseline was increased in 17 out of 102 segments (17%). Significant luminal growth at follow-up was reported in 14 segments (14%). The specificity of regional PWV-testing was ≥78% for all aortic segments, sensitivity was ≤33%. CONCLUSIONS: Regional PWV was significantly increased in MFS patients as compared to healthy volunteers within similar age range, in all aortic segments except the ascending aorta. Furthermore, regional PWV-assessment has moderate to high specificity for predicting absence of regional aortic luminal growth for all aortic segments in MFS patients.
