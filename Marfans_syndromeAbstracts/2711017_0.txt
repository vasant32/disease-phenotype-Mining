We describe a case of congenital absence of the pericardium of a 42 year-old patient with a variant of Marfan's Syndrome involving the skeletal and cardiovascular system. The diagnosis was formulated not only through an accurate clinical examination, but also through non-invasive tests like a standard radiography of the chest, an echocardiography M-mode and 2-D and a doppler-analysis.
