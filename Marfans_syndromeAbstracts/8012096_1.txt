We describe a patient with neonatal Marfan syndrome presenting with massive ascending and descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Because of rapidly progressive respiratory distress due to tracheobronchial compression, emergency replacement of the descending thoracic aorta with a 12-mm PTFE vascular prosthesis was undertaken at 1 month of age. The postoperative course was complicated by bilateral tension pneumothorax contributing to irreversible respiratory failure. The unique clinico-pathological features and the relevant surgical implications of the case are discussed.
