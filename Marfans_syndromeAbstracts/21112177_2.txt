 OBJECTIVE: Although chronic aortic dissection (CD) has traditionally been considered a predictor of perioperative morbidity and mortality after descending thoracic/thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair (thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm [TAA]), recent reports have rejected this assertion. Still, few contemporary studies document late outcomes after TAA for CD, which is the goal of this study. METHODS: From August 1987 to December 2005, 480 patients underwent TAA; 73 (15%) CD and 407 (85%) degenerative aneurysms (DA). Operative management consisted of a clamp-and-sew technique with adjuncts in 53 (78%) CD and 355 (93%) DA patients (P < .001). Epidural cooling was used to prevent spinal cord injury (SCI) in 51 (70%) CD and 214 (53%) DA patients (P = .007). Study end points included perioperative SCI/mortality, freedom from reintervention, and long-term survival. RESULTS: CD patients were younger (mean age 64.5 years CD vs 72.5 years DA, P < .001) and more frequently had a family history of aneurysmal disease (23% CD vs 6% DA, P < .001). Forty-three (59%) CD patients had elective TAA (vs 322 (79%) DA, P = .001). Eleven (15%) CD patients had Marfan's syndrome (vs 0% DA, P < .001), and 17 (23%) CD patients had a prior arch or ascending aortic repair (vs 16 [4%] DA, P < .001). CD patients were more likely to have Crawford type I & II thoracoabdominal aneurysms (44 [60%] vs 120 [29%] DA, P < .001), while only two (3%) CD patients had type IV aneurysms (vs 99 [24%] DA). There was no difference in perioperative mortality between the two groups (11% CD vs 8.6% DA, P = .52), nor was there a difference in flaccid paralysis, which occurred in five (7%) CD and 22 (5%) DA patients (P = .92). At 5 years, 70% of CD patients were free from reintervention versus 74% of DA (P = .36). The actuarial survival was 53% and 32% at 5 and 10 years for CD versus 47% and 17% for DA (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased operative complexity, CD does not appear to increase perioperative SCI or mortality after TAA when compared with DA. Long-term freedom from aneurysm-related reintervention is similar for both groups as is survival, despite patients with CD being of younger age at presentation.
