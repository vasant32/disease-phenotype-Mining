The authors report a series of 6 cases of recurrent dissection, 4 of which were treated surgically, out of a total of 64 acute dissections of the aorta referred to the CMC Foch, between January 1969 and October 1981. Three types of recurrent dissection were identified: --"de novo" recurrent dissection: a new dissection occurring in part of the aorta previously unaffected with a new intimal tear; --recurrent dissection due to extension of the previous dissection; --"in situ" recurrent dissection. Surgery is the treatment of choice because of the poor prognosis. Extensive resection (sometimes carried out in several stages) and deep hypothermia are valuable techniques when part of the aorta giving off arteries to vital organs has to be replaced. The use of GRF biological glue in the treatment of the original acute dissection has been a significant advance in the prophylaxis of recurrent dissection as it ensures better repair of the distal false lumen (27% persistent false lumens). With respect to an extensive replacement of the dissected vessel, the authors advise operation in several stages, especially in young subjects with Marfan's syndrome who are at high risk of recurrent dissection. All cases of acute dissection of the aorta, operated or not, should be followed up indefinitely with clinical and radiological examination, completed, when necessary, by an angioscan and an aortography.
