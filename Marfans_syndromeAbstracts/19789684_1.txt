Background. The results of acute type A dissection (AAD) surgery in the Netherlands are largely unknown, as was recently stated in a report by the Health Council of the Netherlands. In order to gain more insight into the Dutch situation we investigated predictors of in-hospital mortality of surgically treated AAD patients and assessed threeyear survival.Methods. 104 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for AAD in a 16-year period (1990-2006) were evaluated. Preoperative and intraoperative variables were analysed to identify predictors of early mortality.Results. Preoperative malperfusion (limb ischaemia or mesenteric ischaemia) was present in 15.4%, shock in 18.3%, and 6.7% were operated under cardiac massage. Marfan syndrome was present in four patients and four patients had a bicuspid aortic valve. In-hospital mortality was 22.1%. Seven patients died intraoperatively; other causes of inhospital mortality were major brain damage in ten patients, multiple organ failure in three patients, low cardiac output in two patients and sudden cardiac death in one patient. Multivariate logistic regression revealed preoperative malperfusion (p=0.004) to be the only independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Three-year survival was 68.8+/-4.7% (including hospital mortality). Hospital survivors had a three-year survival of 88.3+/-3.9%.Conclusion. In-hospital mortality of our patients (22.1%) is comparable with the results of larger case series published in the literature. Prognosis after successful surgical treatment is relatively good with a three-year survival of 88.3% in our series. (Neth Heart J 2009;17:226-31.).
