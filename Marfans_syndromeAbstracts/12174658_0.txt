A family of 3 patients with Marfan syndrome was reported. All of them had surgical interventions in cardiovascular disorders such as DeBakey type I, III aortic dissection and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. In 2 patients, multiple surgical treatments were performed for aneurysmal dilatation of the distal false lumen or another lesions of the treated aorta. Since cardiovascular lesions of Marfan syndrome are systemic and progressive, the postoperative long term follow-up, including systemic evaluation of the arterial system, is essential to detect the latent cardiovascular complications. Careful examining the family with Marfan syndrome is necessary to discover any cardiovascular abnormalities in these people early.
