Mutations in the gene coding for fibrillin on chromosome 15 (FBN1) are known to cause Marfan syndrome (MFS). A related disorder, dominant ectopia lentis (EL), has also been linked genetically to this locus. We now describe ten novel mutations of FBN1 resulting in strikingly different phenotypes. In addition to classic MFS, FBN1 mutations also give rise to EL and a severe neonatal form of MFS. Interestingly, the neonatal MFS mutations are clustered in one particular region of FBN1, possibly providing new insights into genotype-phenotype comparisons.
