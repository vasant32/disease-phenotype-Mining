A patient had a parathyroid adenoma and prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor, suggestive of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I syndrome. The presence of a marfanoid habitus--found more typically in MEN III syndrome--as well as mitral valve prolapse, mental retardation, and bilateral optic atrophy suggests a new variant of the MEN syndrome, possibly representing widespread dysplasia of endocrine and other tissues.
