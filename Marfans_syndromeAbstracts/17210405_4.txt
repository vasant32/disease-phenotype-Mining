Large bilateral aneurysm of the subclavian artery is an infrequent entity that can progress to thrombosis, embolization, or rupture if left untreated. Treatment consists of exclusion of the aneurysm by an endovascular procedure or open surgery. We present a case of large bilateral subclavian artery aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome that was treated by a combination of endovascular and conventional surgery. This therapeutic approach provided good results for patency with lower morbidity and mortality.
