OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in a cohort of women with either Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Study Design: Female patients with either Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were identified through a medical records search at two urban hospitals. Each patient's medical record was reviewed, and the history of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence was obtained through telephone interview. RESULTS: Twelve women with Marfan syndrome were identified. Among these women 5 (42%) reported a history of urinary incontinence and 4 (33%) reported a history of pelvic organ prolapse. Eight women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were identified. Among these women 4 (50%) reported a history of urinary incontinence and 6 (75%) reported a history of pelvic organ prolapse. CONCLUSIONS: Women with Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have high rates of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. This finding supports the hypothesized etiologic role of connective tissue disorders as a factor in the pathogenesis of these conditions.
