A consecutive series of 1288 mitral valves surgically excised from 1981 through 1989 were studied macroscopically and histologically. The explanted valves were affected by: chronic rheumatic disease (1179, 91.5%), floppy mitral valve (84, 6.5%), bacterial endocarditis (19, 1.5%), and post-ischemic mitral incompetence (6, 0.5%). Among 1179 post-rheumatic cases, mixed mitral stenosis and incompetence was the most frequent malfunction (747, 58%). Isolated mitral incompetence was diagnosed in 72 (6.11%) cases only, and isolated stenosis in 360 cases. In 52 valves, excised because of chronic rheumatic disease, the histology showed unexpected signs of acute rheumatism of the leaflets and the papillary muscles. In these patients clinical symptoms and blood tests were negative for rheumatic disease. Mitral incompetence, possibly due to papillary muscle dysfunction, was the prevalent lesion (61.5%). A total of 181 patients (14.05%) with pure mitral incompetence underwent surgery. In 84 patients (46.4%), the floppy mitral valve was the most frequent cause of valve dysfunction, 72 (39.8%) had rheumatic disease, 19 (10.5%) infective endocarditis, and 6 (3.4%) ischemic heart disease. In the group with floppy mitral valve, males were more prevalent than females (51:33). The mean age of the 4 patients with Marfan's syndrome and non-Marfan patients was noticeably different (17 vs 49 yr). Moreover leaflet deformation, tendinous cord elongation and annulus dilatation were the most common causes of valve incompetence. Floppy mitral valve and infective endocarditis were the cause of cordal rupture in 43.5% of the cases. This was a severe complication which always required emergency surgery.
