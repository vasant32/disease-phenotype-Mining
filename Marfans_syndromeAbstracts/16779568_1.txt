In a twenty five-year-old female patient, we observed bilateral lens dislocation into the vitreous body that occurred spontaneously as a result of Marfan's syndrome and megalocornea, when she was 8 years old. Corneal diameters were 14 mm in the right eye and 13.5 mm in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed miosis and iridodonesis. Fundus examination revealed bilateral inferior lens dislocation into the vitreous body. There was no lens induced posterior uveitis in either eye. This patient demonstrated that lens dislocation into the vitreous body can be present for a long time without causing any intraocular inflammation.
