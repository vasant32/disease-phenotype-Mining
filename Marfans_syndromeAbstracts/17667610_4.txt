PURPOSE: To examine the cornea of patients with Marfan syndrome in comparison with a control group by using the in vivo confocal microscope. METHODS: Twenty-four eyes of 12 patients with Marfan syndrome had their corneas examined using the in vivo confocal microscope Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) II/Rostock Cornea Module. The control group included 24 eyes of 12 subjects who had their corneas examined by the same in vivo confocal microscope. RESULTS: Epithelium and neural plexus examination did not show any difference between the 2 groups. Examination of the stroma showed no significant differences concerning the morphology and density of keratocytes. The extracellular matrix of 16 of the 24 eyes of the Marfan group was clearly visible and showed thin highly reflective interconnected lines between keratocytes. In the healthy eye group, reflective lines were observed in only 5 of the 24 eyes. The endothelium of 14 corneas of the Marfan group showed brightly reflective particles. In no cornea of the control group were such particles observed. CONCLUSIONS: Highly reflective extracellular matrix of the stroma and brightly reflective particles among the endothelial cells were the 2 main corneal findings observed by using in vivo corneal confocal microscopy in patients with Marfan syndrome compared with a control group. Further studies need to be made to confirm these findings and eventually find new criteria for Marfan syndrome from the examination of in vivo corneal confocal microscopy.
