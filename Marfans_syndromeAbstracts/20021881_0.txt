 OBJECTIVE: Fibrillin-1, the major constituent of extracellular microfibrils, plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome (MFS, #54700). The aim of this study was to analyze protein models of the mutation of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene on Arg545Cys and Arg1530Cys which have been reported to cause predominant ectopia lentis in Chinese patients. METHODS: We constructed and analyzed the protein models of the mutant FBN1 gene on Arg545Cys and Arg1530Cys. Fibrillin-1 protein structures were predicted by SWISS-MODEL. Models were viewed in Swiss-Pdb Viewer. RESULTS: Computer construction and analysis of protein models of the mutant FBN1 gene revealed that the mutant Arg545Cys FBN1 protein had various changes on protein's secondary structure with an absence of a helix, decreased hydrogen bond distance, different protein surface solvent-accessibility and decreased negative electrostatic potential. The mutant Arg1530Cys FBN1 showed lost of hydrogen bonds, different protein surface solvent-accessibility and increased negative electrostatic potential. CONCLUSIONS: Protein models of the mutant FBN1 gene shows significant alterations on the protein's secondary structure based on computer construction and analysis technology. This study provides further evidence for the important effect of the mutant FBN1 on the pathogenesis of human ectopia lentis.
