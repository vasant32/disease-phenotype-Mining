OBJECTIVE: To present a case of aortic dissection in a pregnant woman with Marfan's syndrome. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 34-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome developed gestational hypertension and Type III aortic dissection during the third trimester. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography and aortography. OUTCOME: Although the dissection progressed, the woman was treated successfully. Elective caesarean section was performed. At follow-up the dissection had healed. CONCLUSION: Marfan's syndrome introduces a high risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy and the treatment chosen is crucial. As dilatation of the aorta is progressive, patients with Marfan's syndrome should be followed up closely and offered prophylactic surgery if necessary.
