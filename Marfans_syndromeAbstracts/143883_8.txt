Aortic and mitral valve abnormalities have been reported which clearly appear to be related to the underlying connective tissue disorder in two patients, a father and daughter, with osteogenesis imperfecta. Although this appears to occur with a much lower prevalence and lesser severity than in the Marfan syndrome, the true prevalence of cardiac connective tissue involvement is not known, and the orthopedic complications of osteogenesis imperfecta may have overshadowed attention to cardiovascular abnormalities. In evaluating patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, careful attention should be paid to cardiovascular findings and if valvular lesions are noted, patients should be instructed regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis for dental and surgical procedures. The valvular lesions can progress, and regular follow-up cardiovascular evaluation should be planned. Finally, despite potential problems with tissue friability and healing and a possible tendency for increased bleeding, successful valve replacement can be carried out if necessitated by cardiac disability.
