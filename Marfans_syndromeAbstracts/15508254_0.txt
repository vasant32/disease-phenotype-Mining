PURPOSE: To investigate the technique of managing anterior vitreous by high gluey Healon. METHODS: In 15 eyes of 15 cases having undertaken in situ phacoemulsification vitreous loss, 12 eyes of 12 cases in ECCE, 3 eyes of 2 cases in Marfan Syndrome, 13 eyes of 13 cases in eye injury, tunnel incision was made and PC-IOL implantation was performed after high gluey Healon managing anterior vitreous on all the cases. RESULTS: High gluey Healon managing anterior vitreous in 43 eyes, post capsule injuries was not enlarge, and cortex or fragments of len nuclear not fall in vitreous cavity. Visual acuity of 0.5 or better at postoperative one week were 72.1% and 59.1% respectively. CONCLUSION: The technique of managing anterior vitreous by high gluey Healon was worthy to be spread due to minimum injury, vitreous loss, and fast restoration of visual acuity.
