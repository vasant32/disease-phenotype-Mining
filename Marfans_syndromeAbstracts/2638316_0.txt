Complete dislocation of the lens is a rare feature of Marfan's Syndrome. We observed four cases of bilateral complete posterior dislocation of the lens in established cases of Marfan's Syndrome over a one year period. An ophthalmologist may encounter infrequently, unilateral posterior dislocation in one eye and ectopia lentis in the other, but bilateral spontaneous posterior dislocation is rare. All our cases had associated vitreous degeneration with vitreous herniating into the anterior chamber. The pathogenesis of complete posterior dislocation in Marfan's Syndrome is discussed.
