Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an unusual and a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden death with multiple predisposing factors. Prompt recognition is crucial for appropriate patient management, but specific guidelines for optimal treatment are lacking. We report four cases of women with spontaneous coronary artery dissection revealed by ST-segment elevation, three in women during postpartum and one case associated with a Marfan syndrome. Our cases span the different therapeutic options from medical treatment, stenting, to coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
