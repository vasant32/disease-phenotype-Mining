Aortic Dissection seldom affects young women. Nevertheless, the structural changes in the arterial wall, that occur during pregnancy, may predispose women to this complication, particularly in the third trimester and peripartum period. Aortic Dissection in gestation is associated specially with the Marfan's syndrome. The authors report a case of a pregnant woman in the 35th week of gestation, without Marfan's disease, admitted to Hospital on suspicious of type A aortic dissection.
