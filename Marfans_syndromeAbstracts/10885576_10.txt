Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS IV) are three clinical entities characterized by vascular abnormalities that result from mutations of structural components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Analyses of naturally occurring human mutations and of artificially generated deficiencies in the mouse have provided insights into the pathogenesis of these heritable disorders of the connective tissue. SVAS is associated with haploinsufficiency of elastin, one of the two major components of the elastic fibers. SVAS is characterized by narrowing of the arterial lumen due to the failure of regulation of cellular proliferation and matrix deposition. Mutations in fibrillin 1 are the cause of dissecting aneurysm leading to rupture of the ascending aorta. Fibrillin-1 is the building block of the microfibrils that span the entire thickness of the aortic wall and are a major component of the elastic fibers that reside in the medial layer. The vascular hallmark of EDS IV is rupture of large vessels. The phenotype is caused by mutations in type III collagen. The mutations ultimately affect the overall architecture of the collagenous network and the biomechanical properties of the adventitial layer of the vessel wall. Altogether, these genotype-phenotype correlations document the diversified contributions of distinct extracellular macroaggregates to the assembly and function of the vascular matrix.
