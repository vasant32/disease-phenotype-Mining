BACKGROUND: Unlike myxomatous degeneration in Marfan syndrome, which has been reported to result from a mutation in the gene that codes for the extracellular structural protein fibrillin, no specific molecular abnormality has been documented to be the underlying cause of myxomatous degeneration in mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS). The present study examined the distribution of fibrillin and other extracellular matrix proteins in patients with isolated MVPS. METHODS: Mitral valve leaflets from 7 MVPS patients and 5 rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients were characterized immunohistochemically for fibrillin, elastin, collagen I, and collagen III distribution, and compared with five normal mitral valves. RESULTS: In normal mitral valve leaflets immunostaining for fibrillin, elastin, collagen I, and collagen III revealed a fibrillary and laminar pattern in the atrialis and the spongiosa. In addition, both the collagens were present in the ventricularis, and the coarse bundles in the fibrosa exhibited alternating bandlike collagen I immunoreactivity. The staining patterns of fibrillin, elastin, and collagens I and III revealed distinctly different distribution in MVPS relative to the normal and RHD leaflets. MVPS leaflets in areas of myxoid degeneration displayed a more diffuse, weaker, and nonlaminar pattern of staining for fibrillin. Similar, but less severe abnormality of elastin, collagen I, and collagen III was also observed. Unlike diffuse abnormality in MVPS, the disruption of extracellular proteins in RHD only occurred at the site of the inflammatory damage, but the overall architecture was preserved. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest a primary role for abnormal fibrillin and other matrix proteins in producing myxoid degeneration of mitral valve leaflets in MVPS.
