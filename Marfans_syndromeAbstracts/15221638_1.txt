Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular matrix. Allelic variations in the gene for fibrillin-1 ( FBN1) have been shown to cause MFS. To date, over 550 mutations have been identified in patients with MFS and related connective tissue diseases. However, about a half of MFS cases do not possess mutations in the FBN1 gene. These findings raise the possibility that variants located in other genes cause or modify MFS. To explore this possibility, firstly we analyzed FBN1 allelic variants in 12 Japanese patients with MFS, and secondly we analyzed fibrillin-3 gene ( FBN3) in patients without FBN1 mutations using conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and direct sequencing analysis. We identified three novel FBN1 mutations and ten FBN3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this report, we could not detect a responsible mutation of the FBN3 gene for MFS. Although the number of the cases in this report is small, at least these results suggest that disease-causing mutations in exon regions of the FBN3 gene are very rare in MFS.
