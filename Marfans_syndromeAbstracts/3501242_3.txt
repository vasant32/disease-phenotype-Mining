We discuss the statistical and biological problems of adapting the theoretical bingo model to the analysis of empirical data. A distinction is made between an idealized pathogenetic model, which aims to represent the disease in as much authentic detail as the present state of knowledge allows and in components that have literal interpretation, and an empirical model, which deals with those effects of the pathogenetic model that one may hope to observe clinically. We review a variety of empirical models distinguishable by the amount of data available on intermediate degrees of damage short of total destruction. The relationship of damage to time is explored, and we consider the criteria and usefulness of linearization of this relationship where the diachronic ("longitudinal") data are few and extend over a comparatively short time. Every time a patient is examined, the degree of cumulative damage is assessed in each of the body systems of interest. Thus the examination will furnish a set of measurements, which is obtained on each of several examinations, taken over a period that for preference is long relative to the survival of the system. Specific disorders discussed include dentition and enlargement of the aorta with age in the Marfan syndrome.
