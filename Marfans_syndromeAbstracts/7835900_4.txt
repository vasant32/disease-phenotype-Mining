We report the cDNA sequence for the bovine gene for fibrillin corresponding to the human gene, fibrillin 1 (FBN1), and the localization of the gene to bovine chromosome 10 (syntenic group U5). The identity between the human and bovine sequences is 97.8% at the amino acid level and 92% at the nucleotide level. The bovine fibrillin sequence contains the same number and type of motifs as the human FBN1 sequence, including the same number of putative calcium binding sites. All of the motifs conform to the patterns demonstrated in the human sequence, and many of the differences in identity between the sequences are conservative.
