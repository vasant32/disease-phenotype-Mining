Several authors have reported aortic dissection in Marfan's syndrome with familial incidence. Cases of dissecting aortic aneurysms have likewise been described in families whose members had severe systemic arterial hypertension. We report 4 cases of familial aortic aneurysm, 3 of whom had a dissection, in the absence of Marfan's phenotype but with histologic findings and genetic transmission similar to those previously described as formes frustes of Marfan's syndrome.
