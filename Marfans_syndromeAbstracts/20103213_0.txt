BACKGROUND: We reviewed our experience with aortic valve-sparing operations in Marfan syndrome during last 5 years. METHODS: Between March 2004 and June 2009, 94 patients with aortic root aneurysms underwent valve-sparing operations. Of these, 37 (68% male) were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, according to the Ghent diagnostic criteria. Mean age was 30 +/- 10 years (range, 11 to 59 years). Moderate/severe aortic regurgitation was present in 13%, and the mean diameter of the Valsalva sinuses was 50 +/- 4 mm (range, 42 to 62 mm). The David V modification was performed in the last 28 patients. Additional procedures were mitral valve repair in 6, tricuspid valve repair in 3, closure of septal atrial defect in 2, and closure of a patent foramen ovale in 13. Mean follow-up was 27 +/- 16 months (range, 1 to 61 months). RESULTS: There were no in-hospital deaths and no major adverse outcomes. One patient required implantation of a mechanical prosthesis during the same procedure because of moderate aortic regurgitation. One late death occurred. No patients required reoperation. In the last follow-up, 23 patients did not have aortic regurgitation, 12 had grade I, and 1 had grade II. No thromboembolic complications have been documented, and 97% of the patients are free from anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term and midterm results with the reimplantation technique for aortic root aneurysms in Marfan patients are excellent. If long-term results are similar, this technique could be the treatment of choice for these patients.
