A patient with Marfan's syndrome suffered aortic dissection with subsequent aortic arch replacement and coronary artery bypass grafts during pregnancy. Antepartum therapy consisted of bed rest, heparin anticoagulation, propranolol and fetal evaluation. After amniocentesis to determine fetal lung maturity, cesarean section with epidural anesthesia and invasive hemodynamic monitoring was performed at 34 weeks' gestation, resulting in delivery of a viable girl without demonstrable congenital abnormalities. The maternal postoperative course was uneventful. This report is the first of such a case.
