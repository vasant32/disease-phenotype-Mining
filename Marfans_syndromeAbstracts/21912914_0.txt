Acute aortic syndromes (AAS) comprise a group of potentially lethal conditions that require prompt recognition, diagnosis as well as acute medical stabilization and surgical intervention. The purpose of this article is to review the relevant variants of AAS presentation, as well as diagnostic and management issues, including adequate long-term medical therapy and follow-up imaging. In this context, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recently published guidelines on the management of thoracic aortic disease, drawing greater attention to these processes.
