 BACKGROUND: Mutations in different domains of the Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene may be responsible for the variable phenotypic expression of Marfan's syndrome that may present with CSF hypovolemia. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between mutations in the Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene and spontaneous CSF hypovolemia (SCH) in a Korean population. METHODS: We studied 10 consecutive patients with SCH without clinical characteristics of Marfan's syndrome. The genetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Direct sequencing analysis of the FBN1 gene identified 15 genetic variations, of which 5 coding (3 synonymous, 2 nonsynonymous) and 8 intronic variations were listed in the single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP). The other 2 variations, c.2728 - 12T > C in intron 21 and c.4582 - 19A > G in intron 35, were also observed in normal controls with estimated frequencies of 0.06 and 0.15, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We could not identify any FBN1 variations possibly associated with SCH in our study population.
