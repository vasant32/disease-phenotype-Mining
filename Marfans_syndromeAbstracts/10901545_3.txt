A case of post-traumatic aneurysm of a jejunal branch of the superior mesenteric artery in a patient with Marfan's syndrome is reported. Ascending aortic involvement is well known in Marfan's syndrome but no association with visceral artery aneurysms has been previously described. The blunt abdominal trauma preceding the detection of the aneurysm may have been the precipitating cause in a predisposed patient. Because of the high risk of rupture, aneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery branches should be treated. Excision or ligation without restoring continuity are the most common surgical procedures; endovascular embolization is an alternative option especially in high risk patients.
