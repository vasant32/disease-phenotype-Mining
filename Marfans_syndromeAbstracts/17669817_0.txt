Berlin Heart INCOR system is a novel left ventricle assist device (LVAD), which generates a laminar blood flow. Its cannulas are implanted in the heart apex and the ascending aorta. The present paper reports a case of successful implantation of the Berlin Heart INCOR system after a Bentall/De Bono operation. In this case the outflow cannula of the device was implanted in the Sorin Carbonart 27/30 conduit used in the previous operation. After the implantation no unusual events like thrombosis, anastomosis malfunction, and so forth, were observed. On the 100th day after the implantation the patient was discharged home in good condition.
