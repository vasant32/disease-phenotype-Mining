 OBJECTIVE: To review our experience in surgical treatment of ascending aortic aneurysm (AAA) with aortic insufficiency in 14 cases of by Bentall's procedure. METHODS AND RESULTS: All the patients underwent replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with composite valved vascular prosthesis and received direct implantation of the aortic graft of the coronary orifices (Bentall's procedure) with satisfactory results. Five patients had ascending aortic dissection and 4 had typical Marfan's syndrome. All the patients suffered severe aortic insufficiency while 2 had mitral insufficiency. Coronary orifices were implanted in situ in 13 cases while in 1 case, Cabrol's method was adopted. No death occurred during the surgery and in the subsequent follow-up, and all the patients had good recovery. CONCLUSION: Bentall's procedure can be effective in the treatment of AAA with aortic insufficiency.
