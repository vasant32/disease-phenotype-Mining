Precursor cell division in growing cartilage determines human height, the lengths of the spine and limb bones, the alignment of joints, spines and limbs, and the ratio of spinal length to limb length. That division also helps to determine the sizes and shapes of joints, apophyses and epiphyses. Ideas about what controls those facts are changing. To former views, in which mainly genetic and humoral factors controlled them, the Utah paradigm of skeletal physiology adds long-overlooked biomechanical including muscular factors. These three kinds of factors would collaborate in controlling the precursor cell division that determines the above skeletal features. Problems with that control clearly cause or help to cause many clinical disorders. Examples include short stature, gigantism, premature and delayed skeletal maturation, some changes in fracture patterns associated with puberty, joint malalignments, congenital hip dysplasia, scoliosis, limb torsions, the ball-and-socket ankle, and some skeletal abnormalities in Marfan's syndrome and the osteochondrodystrophies. The physiology such things depend on has matured sufficiently to justify a review for pediatricians, endocrinologists and other clinical specialists, and many basic scientists.
