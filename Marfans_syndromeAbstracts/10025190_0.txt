About 1% of pregnant women have concomitant cardiac disease. An understanding of the impact of the physiologic changes associated with pregnancy upon structural cardiac disease is essential for proper counseling and management of these complex patients, which should be treated in a specialized team with experience in congenital as well adult disease. The availability of echocardiography provides information about disease aetiology, accurate and non invasive assessment of severity and means of monitoring progression. Contraindication for pregnancies still remain severe pulmonary artery hypertension and Eisenmenger-syndrome and severe surgical non corrected cyanotic disease as well. Postrheumatic stenosis, even when previously asymptomatic, can lead to pulmonary edema. Although pregnancies with asymptomatic regurgitant lesions are better tolerated. The best procedure in severe aortic insufficiency still remains controversial. Patients with Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilatation are at risk for aortic dissection and are difficult to manage. In patients with artificial valves continuing anticoagulation with warfarin is proposed in Europe. Due to accelerated valve deterioration during pregnancy the use of bioprotheses in women who need valvular heart surgery before pregnancy necessitate later valve replacement again and perhaps an autograft or homograft could be an alternate approach. Bacterial endocarditis in pregnancy shows a low incidence and is often associated with prior history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease. Therefore prophylaxis is recommended. There is an increase in the incidence of congenital heart disease among the offsprings of affected parents. Fetal echocardiography, in combination with a multidisciplinary postnatal approach, can be used in the successful treatment of severe form of congenital heart disease.
