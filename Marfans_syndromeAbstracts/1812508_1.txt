This case report describes a patient in whom orthodontic treatment and poor oral hygiene resulted in a severe mucogingival problem associated with a mandibular incisor tooth. Following mucogingival surgery, the esthetic and the oral hygiene maintenance problems were resolved. Orthodontic treatment carried out without periodontal consideration may, in some cases, jeopardize the final result.
