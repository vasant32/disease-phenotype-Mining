We report a successful repair of an acute type-A aortic dissection during pregnancy. A 29-year-old pregnant woman in the 32 weeks of gestation with Marfan Syndrome was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of anterior chest and back pains. An urgent aortogram through pulmonary artery revealed an aortic dissection beginning from the ascending aorta to the aortic bifurcation. On the following day, an emergent Cesarean section was performed and a baby weighing 1944 g was delivered. Thereafter, cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted and the ascending aorta was opened. An intimal tear was found 2 cm above the aortic valve. The dissected space was closed with reinforcement of Teflon felt strip. A Dacron gusset was sutured to restore aortic continuity. During the weaning from the CPB, a retrograde aortic dissection developed and the heart became arrested. Therefore we immediately converted the aortic perfusion cannula from the right external iliac artery to graft of the ascending aorta, and the operation was completed successfully with a good recovery of the heart. The mother and her child have been alive and well for 3 years and 5 months after the operation.
