PURPOSE: To report the endovascular repair of rare true aneurysms of the subclavian artery in patients with degenerative connective tissue disorders. CASE REPORTS: Two patients, one with Marfan syndrome and the other with idiopathic cystic medial necrosis, presented with 3 subclavian artery aneurysms. A Wallgraft and 2 Viabahn covered stents were used to successfully exclude these aneurysms. After 3 months, the Wallgraft thrombosed, but the contralateral Viabahn remained patent at the most recent examination 13 months after treatment. The other patient with the unilateral aneurysm had a patent Viabahn stent-graft at 10 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with degenerative connective tissue disorders may benefit from less invasive treatment with stent-grafts. The more flexible Viabahn stent-graft may be better able to adapt to arterial tortuosity. However, the long-term results of this new technique have not yet been established.
