This paper reported four cases of acute coronary artery occlusion occurred during valve replacement procedure. Case 1 was of Marfan's syndrome who underwent Cabrol procedure. Case 2 was of congenital aortic bileaflet malformation with severe regurgitation and simple right coronary artery, who received the procedure of AVR. Both cases 3 and 4 suffered from rheumatic valve disease who were given DVR and tricuspid valve annuloplasty. All the cases had acute left coronary artery occlusion and did not revive after removal of aortic cross-clamp, which were immediately corrected by coronary bapass grafts from aortic to left descending branch with saphonous veins. All the patients successfully weaned from asistant circulation. Two cases survived. The causes of acute coronary artery occlusion were analyzed and the diagnostic methods and management introduced.
