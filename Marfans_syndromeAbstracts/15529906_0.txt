A 7-year-old girl was admitted because of dyspnea on exertion and palpitations. Her symptoms had gradually worsened for the last 6 months. She had physical features of the Marfan syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ascending aortic aneurysm, severe aortic regurgitation, and mildly dilated left ventricle. Because of marked aortic aneurysm and severe aortic regurgitation, the patient was treated with a beta-blocker and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Surgery was refused by her parents. We describe here a child with Marfan syndrome in whom significant dilatation of the ascending aorta and severe aortic regurgitation is encountered and major cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome were reviewed.
