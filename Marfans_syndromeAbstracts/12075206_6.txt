OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a complete analysis of the oral abnormalities of patients with Marfan syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty three patients with Marfan syndrome and 69 healthy controls were studied. The subjects were screened for cariologic and periodontal alterations, as well as structural defects of enamel and dentin. Data analysis was performed by using the t test, the chi-square test, and regression models. RESULTS: Patients aged 0 to 17 years were significantly at risk for caries. Local hypoplastic enamel spots were more frequent in Marfan syndrome and could be related to caries history of the deciduous dentition. Root deformity, abnormal pulp shape, and pulpal inclusions were a frequent finding in patients with Marfan syndrome. Calculus and gingival indices were significantly higher in the study group as well. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of early diagnosis of oral anomalies and timely treatment of dental problems in Marfan syndrome. A series of therapeutic guidelines to be integrated in treatment strategies is proposed.
