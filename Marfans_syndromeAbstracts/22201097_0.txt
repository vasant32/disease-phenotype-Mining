Marfan's syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of the connective tissues caused by insufficient fibrillin-1 microfibril formation and can cause cardiac complications, emphysema, ocular lens dislocation and severe periodontal disease. ADAMTSL6β, a microfibril-associated extracellular matrix protein that has been implicated in fibrillin-1 microfibril assembly is able to improve microfibril insufficiency in MFS mice model. These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MFS through ADAMTSL6β-mediated fibrillin-1 microfibril assembly. We here review effect on ADAMTSL6β to the improvement of microfibril insufficiency in periodontal tissue as a model.
