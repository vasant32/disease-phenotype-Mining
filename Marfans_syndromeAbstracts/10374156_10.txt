PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term follow-up in eyes of children who had sulcus fixation of an intraocular lens (IOL) without capsular support. SETTING: St. Eriks Eye Hospital/Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 eyes of 13 children. Seven eyes had Marfan's syndrome, 7 essential lens dislocation, 2 perforation with lens injury, and 5 spherophakia. The IOL implantation was primary in 16 eyes and secondary in 5 eyes. Lensectomy was performed with a limbal approach. An IOL with holes in the haptics was sutured in the sulcus, with the knots buried in the scleral bed. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 5.8 years +/- 2.6 (SD). Follow-up ranged from 9 to 33 months. No complications occurred during surgery. In all cases after IOL implantation, best corrected visual acuity was equal to or better than preoperatively. After surgery, no opacification of the visual axis, secondary glaucoma, or retinal complication was recorded. Posterior synechia formation occurred in 4 eyes, and 4 had cells on the IOL surface in 2 eyes, the IOL optic subluxated into the anterior chamber with the haptics in place. Both cases were successfully treated with pilocarpine 4%. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that sulcus fixation of an IOL without capsular support is an option to correct aphakia in children.
