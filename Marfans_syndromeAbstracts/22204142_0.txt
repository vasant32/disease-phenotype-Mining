The Marfan syndrome, vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and neurofibromatosis 1 are associated with vascural complications that may be fatal. Therefore, referral to treatment should be properly timed, followed by therapy taking special features of the disease into consideration. When treating a vascular malformation related to an inherited disorder, it is important to collaborate with clinical geneticists in order to obtain genetic counseling and DNA diagnostics as well as to elucidate the status of close relatives.
