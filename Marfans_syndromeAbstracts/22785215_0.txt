 BACKGROUND: The best option for repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA)-whether open operation or stent grafting-is increasingly a subject of controversy. We examined the results of open surgical repair in patients aged 60 years or younger to assess the value of conventional repair in younger patients. METHODS: From October 2002 to October 2010, 107 of 294 TAAA operations were in patients (75 men [70%]) aged a mean of 48 Â± 9 years. Twelve patients (11%) had Marfan syndrome. Operations were elective in 101 (94%); previous aortic operations had been performed in 40 (37%). The most common indication for operation was chronic dissection, in 60 (56%); 5 (4.7%) had acute dissection, and rupture was present in 6 (5.6%). Descending repair was undertaken in 44 (41%), in 32 (73%) as an elephant trunk stage II. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 46 (42.9%). Neurologic monitoring and cerebrospinal fluid drainage were routine. Median postoperative follow-up was 4.3 years (range, 2 days to 7.9 years). RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 4.7%. Stroke occurred in 4 patients (3.7%) and paraplegia in 1 (0.9%). The linearized rate for reoperation for TAAA was 0.22/100 patient-years (1 patient in 448.8 patient-years). Survival at 1, 5, and 8 years was 90.5%, 89.4% and 80.5%, respectively. During follow-up, 1 patient with Ehlers-Danlos died of aortic complications at 4.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although direct comparison with stent grafting is limited by the diversity of patients and indications in published reports, our results suggest that open repair should be the modality of choice. Early mortality and neurologic complication rates are similar, if not superior, to endovascular repair for descending aortic and TAAAs. Open repair has proven durability and a very low rate of required reintervention, in contrast with endovascular repair.
