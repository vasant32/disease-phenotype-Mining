Annuloaortic ectasia due to Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is reported. A 10-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of chest pain. On admission, he was diagnosed as SGS on the basis of his various anomalies. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed a bicuspid aortic valve and marked annular dilatation, Doppler flow studies revealed severe aortic regurgitation, and retrograde aortography showed severe aortic regurgitation with annular dilatation. Successful aortic root replacement was performed; subsequent histologic examination of the ascending aorta demonstrated cystic medial necrosis. In conclusion, SGS is a generalized connective tissue dysplasia, with clinical manifestations of cardiovascular lesions similar to those in Marfan syndrome. Aortic root replacement was successfully performed; however, recurrence of aortic aneurysms outside of the ascending aorta should be carefully observed. Surgical treatment for cardiovascular disorders may be necessary to save the life of patients with SGS.
