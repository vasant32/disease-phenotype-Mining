In today's clinical practice cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is increasingly used for assessment of congenital and acquired heart disease in children. CMR complements echocardiography and provides a noninvasive alternative to diagnostic cardiac catheterization. In contrast to echocardiography, CMR is not limited by acoustic windows, and unlike cardiac catheterization, CMR lacks ionizing radiation. Contiguous three and four dimensional data sets allow to display cardiac and thoracic vessel anatomy in any desired imaging plane. These characteristics provide unique images for the complete depiction of the pathological anatomy in particular in congenital heart disease. Furthermore CMR is also used for assessment of cardiac function, blood-flow measurements, tissue characterization, and, more recently, for evaluation of myocardial perfusion and viability. The following article reviews CMR indications in pediatric cardiology by means of clinical examples.
