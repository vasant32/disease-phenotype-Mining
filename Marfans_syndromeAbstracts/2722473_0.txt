Cardiovascular, skeletal and ophthalmologic manifestations of Marfan's syndrome were evaluated in 36 patients with Marfan's syndrome, including 22 females and 14 males whose ages ranged from 3 to 70 years. The patients complained mainly of palpitations and chest pain. Mitral clicks and/or systolic murmurs were heard in 31 patients (86%); skeletal findings were found in 35 patients (97%) and ECG T-wave changes in 11 (30%). Chest X-rays showed cardiac enlargement in six patients (17%) and dilatation of the aorta in two (6%). Holter monitoring performed in 21 patients showed only a few premature atrial and ventricular beats in 4, although prolapse of the mitral valve was found in 18 patients. Echocardiography revealed mitral valve prolapse in 32 patients (89%), 21 females (95% of females) and 11 males (79% of males). Aortic root dilatation was found in 19 patients (53%). 11 males (79% of males) and 8 females (36% of females). This study demonstrates the variable clinical expression of Marfan's syndrome and the importance of clinical and noninvasive methods, mainly echocardiography, for its evaluation.
