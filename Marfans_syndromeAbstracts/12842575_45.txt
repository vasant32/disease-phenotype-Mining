Aortic dissection during pregnancy is a life-threatening event. Recent studies have revealed similar histologic changes in the wall of the ascending aorta in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease (BAVD). Based on a review of the literature, including the experience from two institutions, we looked at the patient's characteristics in patients with thoracic aortic dissection during pregnancy. We found that aortic root enlargement (> 4cm) or an increase of aortic root size during pregnancy in patients with BAVD, and Marfan syndrome is associated with a considerable risk for the occurrence of Type A dissection.
