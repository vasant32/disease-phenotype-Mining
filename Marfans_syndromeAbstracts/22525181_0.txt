Iris cysts are uncommon in childhood and can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We present the case of a 5-year-old boy with Marfan syndrome who, 9 months after an uncomplicated lensectomy with iris-sutured intraocular lens (IOL), developed a translucent epithelial inclusion cyst. The cyst was observed without treatment and no complications developed. To our knowledge, this is the first case of an iris cyst in a child after implantation of an iris-sutured IOL. This potential complication should be considered when implanting IOLs in children.
