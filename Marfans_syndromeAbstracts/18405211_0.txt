Congenital bleeding disorders account for approximately one in 10,000 births. Dentists are often anxious about delivering treatment to this special group of patients. In the Irish Republic, patients with inherited bleeding disorders have their dental care co-ordinated centrally at the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders (NCHCD), St James's Hospital, Dublin. Dental care is normally integrated with routine outpatient haematological appointments. This ensures regular monitoring of oral health and the early treatment of any hard/soft tissue pathology. This article describes, in simple diagrammatic form, the normal coagulation mechanism (Figures 1 and 2), explains common coagulation terms (Appendix 1), and examines the three most common congenital bleeding disorders: haemophilia A, haemophilia B, and von Willebrand disease. General recommendations based on the current literature are provided with respect to procedures that are appropriate to perform in a general dental practice setting. Although not discussed in this article, it is important to note that non-coagulation bleeding disorders also exist. These include: hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia; blood vessel wall defects resulting from connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; and, platelet disorders such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome, resulting in defective platelet adhesion.
