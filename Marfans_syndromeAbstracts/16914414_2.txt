 BACKGROUND: We report in this study our results with composite aortic root replacement (CVR) using the classic or modified Cabrol coronary implantation technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From October 2001 to March 2005, 25 patients underwent aortic root replacement. In all cases, the indication for surgery was a degenerative aneurysm with a diameter of more than 6 cm. Seven patients had undergone a previous aortic operation on the ascending aorta. Mean age was 53+/-13 years and 22 patients were male. Mean Euroscore was 5.2+/-2.4. Aortic insufficiency was present in all patients. Two patients had Marfan syndrome. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 0%. Two patients required profound hypothermic circulatory arrest. Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 91+/-24 minutes and the mean circulatory arrest time was 24+/-15 minutes. No patients developed a pseudoaneurysm after the operation. CONCLUSION: We conclude that composite aortic root replacement with the classic or modified Cabrol technique results in a low operative mortality. However, it should be only used when a "button" technique is not feasible.
