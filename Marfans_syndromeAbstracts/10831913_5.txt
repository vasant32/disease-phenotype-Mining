Intracapsular clear crystalline lens extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were performed in 4 highly myopic eyes of 2 patients with Marfan's syndrome. One eye of each patient received an anterior chamber IOL and the other, a scleral-fixated posterior chamber IOL. The preoperative spherical equivalent ranged between -14.50 and -28.00 diopters (D) and axial length range, between 25.32 and 36.02 mm. The SRK II formula was used. Mean uncorrected visual acuity improved from counting fingers to 20/80. Postoperative spherical equivalent correction ranged from -0.75 to +2.75 D. One eye had vitreous loss that was managed by anterior vitrectomy. Modern surgery for cataract and management of its complications suggest that clear crystalline lens extraction and IOL implantation can be attempted in selected cases with Marfan's syndrome.
