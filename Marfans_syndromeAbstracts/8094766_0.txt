Left ventricular pulsus alternans developed immediately after Bentall's operation in a 37-year-old patient with Marfan's syndrome accompanied by severe left heart failure due to annuloaortic ectasia. Echocardiographic examination suggested that this symptom was caused by alternating contractility based on left ventricular myocardial failure. Left heart failure disappeared early after operation, but pulsus alternans persisted until 7 months after operation, when EDVI decreased from 225 ml/m2 to 113 ml/m2.
