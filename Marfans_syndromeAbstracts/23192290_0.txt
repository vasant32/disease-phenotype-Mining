Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate surgical intervention. Although aortic dissection is a rare condition during pregnancy, it is of high risk for both mother and foetus. Most cases of aortic dissection during pregnancy have certain risk factors, including Marfan syndrome and congenital heart diseases. In this study, we report on a case of acute aortic dissection developing spontaneously at 32 weeks of gestation. The patient delivered a baby through cesarean section, and medical management of the dissection was commenced. Both mother and neonate survived and recovered well.
