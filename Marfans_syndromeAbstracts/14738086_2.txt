We report a case of a 69-year-old female patient diagnosed with an axillary-subclavian artery(ASA) aneurysm, 7 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. The aneurysm had recently developed during follow-up for aortic sinus dilation associated with Marfan syndrome, which had been diagnosed in 1987. The patient underwent corrective surgery for the ASA aneurysm, and the aneurysm was histologically diagnosed as a true type with cystic medionecrosis.
