We present an overview of the treatment and clinical outcome of five orbital peripheral nerve tumours, carried out in our centre from 1999 to 2003. The surgical approach was determined by the location and extension of the lesion. Supraorbital orbitotomy was performed in two superiorly located lesions, a transconjunctival approach in one medial, basal, extraconal lesion. A pterional extradural approach was used in two cases with involvement of the apex, superior orbital fissure and cavernous sinus. Three patients were diagnosed as having schwannoma, one as neurofibroma, and one as cystic mixed neurofibroma and schwannoma. One patient suffered from multiple schwannomas [bilateral acoustic schwannomas, cervical schwannomas (NF2)]. One patient showed bilateral orbital neurofibromas, plexiform cutaneous neurofibroma (NF1) and glaucoma due to a coexisting Marfan's syndrome. Local recurrences were not seen after complete resection in all patients. Surgery is the therapeutic goal.
