 PURPOSE: To compare the biomechanical properties of the cornea and intraocular pressure (IOP) between patients with Marfan syndrome and age-matched controls. SETTING: Departments of Ophthalmology and Genetics, Bakirkoy Maternity and Children Diseases Hospital, and Beyoglu Eye Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study comprised patients with Marfan syndrome (study group) and healthy individuals (control group). The study group was subdivided into patients with ectopia lentis and patients without ectopia lentis. In the right eye of each patient, the corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), Goldman-correlated IOP, and corneal-compensated IOP were recorded. RESULTS: Overall, the mean CH, CRF, Goldman-correlated IOP, and corneal-compensated IOP were not significantly different between the study group and the control group. The mean CH was 9.9 mm Hg ± 1.2 (SD) in study eyes with ectopia lentis and 11.2 ± 1.5 mm Hg in study eyes without ectopia lentis (P=.016); the mean CRF was 8.2 ± 1.8 mm Hg and 11.3 ± 1.9 mm Hg, respectively (P<.001). The mean Goldman-correlated IOP was 11.7 ± 2.7 mm Hg in study eyes with ectopia lentis and 16.2 ± 4.3 in study eyes without ectopia lentis (P=.003); the mean corneal-compensated IOP was 13.5 ± 4.1 mm Hg and 15.6 ± 3.8 mm Hg, respectively (P=.07). CONCLUSION: The CH, CRF, and Goldman-correlated IOP were significantly lower in the Marfan syndrome eyes with ectopia lentis than in the Marfan syndrome eyes without ectopia lentis.
