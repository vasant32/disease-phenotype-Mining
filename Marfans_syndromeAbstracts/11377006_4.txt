A young male with Marfan syndrome, diagnosed at the age of 10 years, presented with conspicuous elongation and tortuosity of the internal carotid, middle cerebral, vertebral and basilar arteries on cranial magnetic resonance and computed tomography angiography. There is a little mention of cerebral blood vessel examinations in the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics for Marfan syndrome.
