Dysplasias underlying the mitral and aortic valve diseases in the presence of valvular incompetence were identified in 110 patients with a history of valve replacement. The morphological and electron microscopy evidence together with combinations of valvular changes with Marfan's syndrome and Erdheim's disease, and in some cases with minimal changes in the aorta and peripheral vessels, which followed the type of idiopathic cystic medionecrosis without aneurysm formation support the idea of the dysplastic etiology of the detected abnormalities. The occurrence of a heart disease in the presence of dysplasia is determined by the extent of a valvular process and attending complications, such as chordal rupture or septic endocarditis.
