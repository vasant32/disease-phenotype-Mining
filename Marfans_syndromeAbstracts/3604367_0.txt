A case of aortic dissection at 37 weeks of gestation is presented with demonstration of angiographic and pathological findings. A review of clinical and pathological literature suggests, that rupture of aortic dissecting aneurysms occurs more frequently in women being pregnant than in non-pregnant women of the same age. Women with cardial malformations, coarctatio aortae, Marfan's syndrome and hypertension are at increased risk. Ultrasound scans of heart and thoracic aorta may lead to an early diagnosis in pregnancy. Intrauterine fetal asphyxia and death may be an early symptom due to partial obliteration of Aa. iliacae internae and ovaricae.
