BACKGROUND: An optimal treatment for tall stature in boys in terms of efficacy and safety is not available. Treatment with somatostatin analogue 201-995 (SMS) has been tried with positive short-term results. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of SMS treatment on reducing adult height. Over 2 years, 16 boys presenting to our university hospital with tall stature (constitutional tall stature (n = 13), Marfan syndrome (n = 2) and tethered spinal cord (n = 1)) with a predicted final height above 197 cm were included in the study and prospectively followed until final height was reached. As one boy was lost to follow-up we have reported on 15 boys. Treatment with SMS as a single subcutaneous dose was started and continued until final height was reached. In eight boys androgens were given to induce puberty after the start of SMS and five boys were on treatment with androgens prior to SMS treatment. Effect on reduction of final height prediction, calculated with the index of potential height based on the bone age of Greulich and Pyle, was the main outcome measure. Standard anthropometric assessments were performed a year before and every 3 months during treatment. Bone age was assessed by the method of Greulich and Pyle at the start and after 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Mean reduction in final height prediction (predicted adult height minus achieved adult height) was -0.1 cm (range -6.4 to +5.7). In three boys, asymptomatic microlithiasis of the gall bladder was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: We have concluded that, in spite of encouraging short-term results, long-term treatment with SMS does not reduce final height in a manner sufficient to justify SMS treatment in tall stature.
