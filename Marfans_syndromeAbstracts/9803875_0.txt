Two cases of Marfan's syndrome with acute dissection in relation to labour are presented. One patient died of aortic rupture while the other was electively operated. The haemodynamic changes during pregnancy and labour can have catastrophic consequences. The Marfan patient must be well informed before pregnancy and carefully monitored during pregnancy and the peripartum period. Serial echocardiographic studies evaluating aortic root size and aortic valve function are essential. In case of severe cardiovascular manifestation the pregnancy should be interrupted.
