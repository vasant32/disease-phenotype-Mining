Rubeosis iridis developed in the right eye of a 10-year-old boy with Marfan's syndrome. This eye had a chronic retinal detachment which we could study adequately only after coreoplasty of the iris was carried out with the argon laser. The purpose of this paper is to describe our experience using the argon laser for coreoplasty, and to report the unique pinwheel configuration of the iris neovascularization that developed around the laser lesions. We believe the rubeosis iridis was most likely a sequelae of the chronic retinal detachment, and that the atrophic laser lesions probably acted as templates for the neovascularization, giving rise to its peculiar configuration.
