A Chinese girl with Marfan's syndrome had spontaneous pneumothorax and bronchiectasis. Spontaneous pneumothorax is not an infrequent pulmonary manifestation of Marfan's syndrome, but bronchiectasis is rarely reported to occur. So far, it has not been reported that both bronchiectasis and spontaneous pneumothorax can occur in the same patient with Marfan's syndrome.
