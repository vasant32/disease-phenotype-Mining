The conventional surgical management of congenital subluxated lenses is frequently associated with a high incidence of complications leading to poor visual prognosis. Lensectomy through the pars plana with modern techniques of microsurgery and automated suction-cutting devices was performed on 11 patients (18 eyes) whose pre-operative visual acuities with the best optical correction ranged from 0.05-0.3, which were improved postoperatively to 0.5-1.0 during a follow-up of 3 to 60 months with an average of 36 months. The complications were accidental small cuts at the pupillary borders of 3 eyes, indicating that pars plana lensectomy is a safe procedure for the treatment of congenital subluxated lenses.
