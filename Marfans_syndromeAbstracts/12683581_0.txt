In patients with afibrinogenemia who require operation, prophylaxis against bleeding is important. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy with Marfan syndrome and congenital afibrinogenemia in whom hemopneumothorax developed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed successfully under intravenous administration of fibrinogen and with careful monitoring of plasma fibrinogen level.
