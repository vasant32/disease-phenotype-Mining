The reversed elephant trunk operation has been applied in patients with extensive aortic involvement as a scheduled staged operation. We report application of the same technique in two patients with Marfan's syndrome. The two patients underwent total replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta for a DeBakey IIIb aortic dissection. The proximal end of the prosthetic graft was invaginated to facilitate future proximal operation. No complication related to the trunk had been observed during the follow-up period.
