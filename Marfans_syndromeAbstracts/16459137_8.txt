Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a disease characterized by recurrent complete or partial upper airway obstructions during sleep. The majority of patients with SAS demonstrate this obstruction either at the nasopharynx or the oropharynx. Risk factors for SAS include obesity, male gender, upper airway abnormalities, alcohol use, snoring, and neck girth of more than 17 in. in men or 16 in. in women. Reported ophthalmic findings in patients with SAS include floppy eyelid syndrome (FES), glaucoma, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).
