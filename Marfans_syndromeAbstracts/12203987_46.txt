The Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a pleiotropic, autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with highly variable clinical manifestations including aortic dilatation and dissection, ectopia lentis, and a series of skeletal anomalies. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause MFS, and at least 337 mainly unique mutations have been published to date. FBN1 mutations have been found not only in MFS but also in a range of connective tissue disorders collectively termed fibrillinopathies ranging from mild phenotypes, such as isolated ectopia lentis, to severe disorders including neonatal MFS, which generally leads to death within the first two years of life. The present article intends to provide an overview of mutations found in MFS and related disorders and to discuss potential genotype-phenotype correlations in MFS.
