The Berlin Heart INCOR system (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) is a left ventricular assist device that generates a laminar blood flow. One of our INCOR-implanted patients was admitted to the hospital with clinical data indicating device thrombosis. The flow through the pump was assessed by contrast injection into the inflow canula. Lack of flow through the pump was found. A decision was made to perform fibrinolysis, which was performed by a reteplase injection into the device's inflow canula. After the manipulation, a restoration of the flow through the pump was observed. The patient was discharged 9 days after the procedure with no complications.
