We report an unusual case of concomitant Takayasu's arteritis and Marfan syndrome manifesting left main coronary ostial obstruction and annuloaortic ectasia. Simultaneous surgical treatment consisting of left coronary ostium endarterectomy, coronary artery bypass grafting, and Bentall operation was performed. This case is unique in that the cardiovascular manifestations of Takayasu's arteritis and Marfan syndrome were both simultaneously presented and surgically treated.
