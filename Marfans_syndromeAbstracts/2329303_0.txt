Twelve patients had elective surgical treatment for the aneurysm of the ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency at the Kanazawa University School of Medicine between 1976 and 1987. There were 9 men and 3 women aged from 26 to 39 years (mean, 33.0 years). Seven patients had a Marfan's syndrome and 6 of these patients also had aortic dissection. Three patients had aortic valve replacement plus supracoronary tube graft (Wheat's operation) and the other 9 patients underwent composite tube graft, with Bentall's operation in 3, Cabrol's operation in 2, and the modified Bentall's operation in which prosthetic valve was offset inside the tube graft in 4. Early deaths accounted for an operative mortality of 16.7%. The mean aortic cross-clamp time and the amount of bleeding were less with the modified Bentall's operation than with the other composite tube graft procedures. This modification seems to decrease the morbidity and to simplify the procedure in treatment of aneurysm of the ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency. There were 2 late deaths of patients with Marfan's syndrome associated with type I aortic dissection. Regular periodic examinations of the patients is needed, especially when Marfan's syndrome is present, in order to detect and surgically correct residual lesions.
