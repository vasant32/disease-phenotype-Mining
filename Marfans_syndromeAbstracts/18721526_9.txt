Mutations in the genes encoding transforming growth factor-beta receptor types I and II (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, respectively) are commonly identified in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, as well as some patients with Marfan's syndrome or familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. This suggests that there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity associated with mutations in these genes. Because bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital heart defect in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, this study was conducted to investigate whether variants in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 are responsible for sporadic BAV. Analysis of these genes in 35 patients with BAVs identified only known single-nucleotide polymorphisms or novel synonymous or intronic substitutions. In conclusion, mutations in TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 rarely cause sporadic BAV.
