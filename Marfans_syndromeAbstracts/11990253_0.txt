Skin and nail lesions are very rare in Marfan's syndrome. We reported a 14-year-old boy who presented with pterygium in the nails of both the upper and lower limbs with chest deformity along with other features of Marfan's syndrome. Histopathological findings revealed hyperkeratosis with a scant perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. It was not clear whether this case is the first presentation of pterigium in Marfan's syndrome or congenital lichen planus. To our knowledge, this kind of feature is the first Marfan's syndrome case of its kind.
