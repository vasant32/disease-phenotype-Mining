Altogether 125 children with connective tissue dysplasia and mitral valve prolapse were subjected to clinical and echographic examinations. Dilation of the aortic root, elevation of pulmonary artery pressure and derangement of myocardial contractility were discovered. These disorders occurred as a result of disseminated connective tissue abnormalities. It is noted that children with connective tissue dysplasia and mitral valve prolapse require prophylactic medical examination because of progressive alterations on the part of the cardiovascular system with age.
