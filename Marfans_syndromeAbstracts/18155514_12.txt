Marfan syndrome (MFS) is the most common inherited disorder of connective tissue that affects multiple organ systems. This autosomal-dominant condition has an incidence of 2-3 per 10,000 individuals. Although genetic testing is available, the diagnosis is still primarily made using the Ghent criteria. Early identification and appropriate management is critical for patients with MFS who are prone to the life-threatening cardiovascular complications of aortic dissection and rupture. Advances in the understanding of the cause of MFS, early recognition of the disorder, and subsequent institution of medical and surgical therapy has resulted in dramatic improvement in the prognosis of this patient population over the past few decades. Beta-blockers have been demonstrated to slow aortic growth and thus delay the time to aortic surgery. Operative intervention has markedly changed the prognosis of patients with MFS and can be safely performed on an elective basis. Identification of presymptomatic patients is critical to reduce the frequency of catastrophic aortic events.
