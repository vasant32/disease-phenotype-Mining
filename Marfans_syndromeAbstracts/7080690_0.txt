Polyarthralgias are widely common complaints. In earlier stages it might be difficult to state the right diagnosis. Differential diagnosis is absolutely necessary for starting in time with the right treatment. Out of a great clinical material the following diseases causing mono-, oligo- or polyarthralgia were discussed: enchondral dysostosis (osteochondrodysplasia) Marfan's syndrome (arachnodactylia), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (elastic fibrodysplasia), Kaposi's sarcoma (multiple idiopathic hemorrhagic sarcoma) and a disease involving the connective tissue localized in different cutaneous regions. All discussed diseases showed no primary involvement of the synovial membranes of the joints and differed by that from inflammatory joint diseases.
