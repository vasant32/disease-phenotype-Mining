Cardiovascular diseases are the result of the interaction of genetic and environmental factors and constitute a complex group of monogenic and, above all, polygenic pathologies. The possibility of localising the responsible genetic factors on the chromosomes by the study of families may eventually enable a predictive diagnosis, better orientation of treatment and a fuller understanding of the interaction of the different cardiovascular risk factors. The family approach allows the confirmation or the elimination of the role of a given gene of major or minor expression because of the polymorphisms of DNA.
