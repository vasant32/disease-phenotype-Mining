Renal failure and paraplegia are major complications of operations on the descending thoracic aorta. To minimize cross-clamp time and reduce the incidence of such complications, we have used an intraluminal ring graft to reestablish aortic continuity in patients with descending thoracic aortic lesions. From March 1978 to December 1986, we used this technique alone in 28 patients. There were 4 patients with traumatic aortic disruptions, 4 with dissections, 4 with expanding aneurysms, 2 with ruptured aneurysms, 1 with Marfan's syndrome, and 13 with atherosclerotic aneurysms that were repaired electively. The cross-clamp times ranged from 4 to 28 minutes. There were three early postoperative deaths (within 30 days) and one late postoperative death in the follow-up period (mean, 28.2 months). Ring dislodgement occurred only once, in the first patient in this series. There were no instances of postoperative renal failure or paraplegia. We conclude that the use of an intraluminal ring graft greatly reduces the aortic cross-clamp time and is a safe and effective technique.
