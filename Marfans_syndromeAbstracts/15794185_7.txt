The case of a 10-year-old female with Marfan syndrome and postural headache secondary to spontaneous intracranial hypotension is described. The patient was found to have multiple dural ectasias and a cerebrospinal fluid leak at the left cervicothoracic junction. Her presentation, diagnostic work-up, and management are reviewed, and the relevant literature is discussed. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension secondary to cerebrospinal fluid leaks from dural ectasia should be recognized as a potential complication in children with Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue diseases.
