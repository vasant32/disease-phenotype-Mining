A 64-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome was referred with ectopia lentis and visual acuity (VA) of 6/12 bilaterally. He had a history of right BRVO, aortic aneurysm stenting and multiple TIAs and was on warfarin and clopidogrel. He was listed for a right vitreolensectomy. Overnight, however, he had severe left eye pain and vomiting that gradually resolved. On examination, his VA was 6/60 and his pupil was mid-dilated. The cornea was oedematous (figure 1) but his intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14mmHg. He was given pilocarpine drops and listed for a left vitreolensectomy. However, he presented again with an IOP of 48mmHg and a pupil-captured crystalline lens (figure 2). His IOP was successfully controlled medically with intravenous Mannitol, acetazolamide and topical hypotensives, and an Nd-YAG iridotomy was arranged to prevent further episodes. However, upon corneal indentation during gonioscopy the lens relocated to the posterior chamber. The iridotomy was completed and the patient suffered no further acute angle closure episodes. He underwent vitreolensectomy and anterior chamber lens implantation in both eyes. Postoperatively, his best corrected VA was 6/6 and IOP was 18 mmHg.
