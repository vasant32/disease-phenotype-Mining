 PURPOSE: To evaluate aortic diameter outcomes after stent-graft implantation for aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta. METHODS: Fifty patients with type A dissection after ascending aortic surgery (n = 10), type B dissection (n = 34), or intramural hematoma (n = 6) underwent stent-graft repair in 3 centers. Thrombosis and aortic diameter were analyzed by computed tomographic angiography at different levels of the aorta before stent-graft implantation, at discharge, and at follow-up. Measurements were standardized. RESULTS: In all, 67 stent-grafts were implanted for acute (n = 18) and chronic (n = 32) dissection. Stent-graft placement was successfully performed with high technical success (100%) despite 4 major complications (iliac thrombosis in 2 cases, aortic rupture, and a type A dissection) in 3 (6%) patients. Complete thrombosis of the thoracic false lumen was observed in 42% and 63% of cases at discharge and at follow-up (mean 15 months), respectively. At follow-up, the diameters of the entire aorta (mean 5 mm, p < 0.05) and the false lumen (mean 11 mm, p < 0.0001) decreased. Diameters of the abdominal aorta remained stable in association with persistent false lumen perfusion at this level. Aortic diameter results were better in the subgroup of patients with intramural hematoma compared to patients with Marfan syndrome. Three early deaths unrelated to the stent-graft procedure occurred; 2 patients with partial thrombosis of the false lumen died in follow-up secondary to aortic diameter growth. CONCLUSION: Complete thrombosis of the false lumen by stent-graft coverage of the entry tear results in decreased diameter of the entire aorta. In patients with partial thrombosis of the false lumen, the aneurysm continues to enlarge.
