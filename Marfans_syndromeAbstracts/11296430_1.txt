Aortic dissection rarely occurs in 2 or more family members without Marfan's syndrome. This report describes two aged siblings who underwent emergency operations for aortic dissection. Case 1: A 71-year-old female (sister), who had Stanford type B aortic dissection, underwent replacement of the descending aorta with a Hemashield graft. Case 2: A 72-year-old male (brother of case 1), who had Stanford type A aortic dissection, underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with a UBE graft following the closure of the entry located in the proximal arch. Neither of 2 siblings nor other family members had any features of the Marfan's syndrome. It is proposed that two aortic dissections occurred coincidentally in one family without Marfan's syndrome.
