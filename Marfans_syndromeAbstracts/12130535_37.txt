A nonsense mutation in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene of a Marfan syndrome (MFS) patient induces in-frame exon skipping of FBN1 exon 51. We present evidence, based on both in vivo and in vitro experiments, that the skipping of this exon is due to the disruption of an SC35-dependent splicing enhancer within exon 51. In addition, this nonsense mutation induces nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which degrades the normally spliced mRNA in the patient's cells. In contrast to NMD, skipping of FBN1 exon 51 does not require translation.
