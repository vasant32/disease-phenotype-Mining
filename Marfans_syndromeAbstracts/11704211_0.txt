BACKGROUND: Maternal aortic aneurysm can be an unsettling finding for the practicing obstetrician. However, thoracic surgeons generally do not treat asymptomatic aortic aneurysms that are less than 6 cm in diameter in otherwise healthy adults. CASE: A young nullipara was incidentally found to have a 4.5-cm thoracic aortic aneurysm during prenatal care. After extensive counseling and discussions with thoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and perinatologists, the patient requested a trial of labor and underwent an uncomplicated assisted vaginal delivery of a healthy female infant. CONCLUSION: A vaginal delivery occurred safely in a woman with an asymptomatic aortic aneurysm that was less than 6 cm in diameter and not associated with Marfan's syndrome.
