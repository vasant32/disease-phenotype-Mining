To report a case of late diagnosis of a classical familial homocystinuria based on an ophthalmologic examination. A 35-year-old male with Marfan-like phenotype complained of a progressive increase of myopia during the previous 2 years. Ophthalmologic exploration showed a bilateral subluxation of the lens with inferior and nasal displacement. Biochemical study detected a profile of increased amino acid levels (homocysteinemia) consistent with suspected homocystinuria. Vascular and skeletal studies ruled out Marfan syndrome. Response to treatment demonstrated B(6)-non-responsive homocystinuria. Molecular study showed compound heterozygous T353 N and D444 N mutations of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, and also a C667T homozygous mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene. Family study showed classical homocystinuria in his father and sister, although they did not present any systemic or ocular features of the disease. Homocystinuria is a metabolic disease usually presenting at an early age as vascular, skeletal and neuropsychiatric abnormalities, as well as ectopia lentis. Our case is atypical because of the absence of thromboembolism and the mild phenotype, in spite of being B(6)-non-responsive, and the association of a rare compound heterozygous mutation of the CBS gene and also an homozygous mutation of the MTHFR gene. It is necessary to rule out homocystinuria in patients with ectopia lentis, even in the absence of systemic symptoms.
