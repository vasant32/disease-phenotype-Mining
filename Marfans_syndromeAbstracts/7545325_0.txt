Between 1987 and 1994, 39 patients underwent 41 replacements (2 reoperations) of the aortic valve and ascending aorta by composite grafts with mechanical valves. One patient had annuloaortic ectasia, one had a sinus of valsalva aneurysm, 13 patients had a Debakey type I acute dissection, 10 had a Debakey type II acute dissection including two Marfan patients, and 14 had atherosclerotic aneurysms. 6 patients (15%) died within a postoperative period of 30 days. The mean follow-up time was 40 months (1-82 months). Twenty-six patients were restudied by clinical examinations and computed tomography of the chest (CT). Two patients required emergency reoperation due to disruption of the proximal aortic anastomosis and right coronary anastomosis. Both patients had been diagnosed to have Marfan disease. Anastomotic dehiscence of composite grafts has a potentially high risk of lethal complications. In follow-up examination computed tomography was performed as a simple and accurate method to detect complications such as pseudoaneurysms, but up to now did not give the indications for reoperation. We suggest that complications may occur not only in the early postoperative period so that regular CT-scan control studies (every 6 to 12 months) should be performed in all patients who undergo composite graft replacement.
