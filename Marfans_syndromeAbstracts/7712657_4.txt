Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B/3 is characterized by multiple mucosal neuromas, a marfanoid appearance, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, gastrointestinal ganglioneuromatosis, and thickened corneal nerves. This rare syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Early recognition followed by appropriate screening and treatment can be life-saving.
