 BACKGROUND: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common valvular heart disease representing a generalized disease of connective tissue in the primary form. Elastic properties of the aorta with primary MVP may be expected to be increased. We aimed to determine the aortic elasticity in the primary form of MVP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty male patients with a primary form of MVP not having any sign of Marfan syndrome and joint hyperlaxity syndrome and twenty healthy individuals were included in the study. Aortic strain, aortic distensibility index and aortic stiffness index were calculated by using aortic diameters obtained by echocardiography and blood pressures measured by sphygmomanometer. When comparing the MVP group and the control group it was found that the aortic stiffness index was increased (P < 0.05) whereas the aortic distensibility and strain index were decreased (P < 0.05) in the MVP group. There was no significant difference between the characteristics of the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the elastic properties of the aorta were decreased in the primary form of MVP, unexpectedly.Therefore, results of decreased aortic elasticity should also be followed up in patients with MVP.
