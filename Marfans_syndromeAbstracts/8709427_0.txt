Total aortic root replacement was performed on 19 cases since December 1979 to May 1995. They were devided in two groups. First 7 cases were operated by original Bentall procedure with inclusion technique (group A). Succeeding 12 cases were operated by Carrel patch method or Cabrol procedure without inclusion maneuver. There were 2 operative deaths in group A (28.6%) and was one death in group B (8.3%) respectively. The operation time and the extracorporeal circulation time were significantly shorter in group A than that in group B. Anastomotic leakage was noted in 2 cases of group A. One of them required reoperation and another one with coronary ostial leakage died of congestive heart failure. We concluded that non-inclusion method for aortic root replacement was superior to conventional inclusion technique and reimplantation of both coronary ostia with Carrel patch method was the best tactics especially for Marfan syndrome in terms of long term results.
