With people living longer today, averaging 73 years old, the type of patients with inguinal hernias are different than in the past. At the present time, to avoid the high incidence of recurrence due to the aged and weakened tissue component of the groin area, we reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal with Mersilene (dacron) mesh. Most surgeons agree to use a prosthetic mesh in recurrent inguinal hernia repairs. Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to use mesh in patients with connective tissue disorders like Ehlers syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and acquired absence of the posterior wall fascia transversalis. Currently, polypropylene and dacron mesh are the most satisfactory, since they are readily available and become well incorporated by connective tissue.
