 BACKGROUND: Chronobiological rhythms have been shown to influence the occurrence of a variety of cardiovascular disorders. However, the effects of the time of the day, the day of the week, or monthly/seasonal changes on acute aortic dissection (AAD) have not been well studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: Accordingly, we evaluated 957 patients enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) between 1996 and 2000 (mean age 62+/-14 years, type A 61%). A chi2 test for goodness of fit and partial Fourier analysis were used to evaluate nonuniformity and rhythmicity of AAD during circadian, weekly, and monthly periods. A significantly higher frequency of AAD occurred from 6:00 AM to 12:00 noon compared with other time periods (12:00 noon to 6:00 PM, 6:00 PM to 12:00 midnight, and 12:00 midnight to 6:00 AM; P<0.001 by chi2 test). Fourier analysis showed a highly significant circadian variation (P<0.001) with a peak between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM. Although no significant variation was found for the day of the week, the frequency of AAD was significantly higher during winter (P=0.008 versus other seasons by chi2 test). Fourier analysis confirmed this monthly variation with a peak in January (P<0.001). Subgroup analysis identified a significant association for all subgroups with circadian rhythmicity. However, seasonal/monthly variations were observed only among patients aged <70 years, those with type B AAD, and those without hypertension or diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other cardiovascular conditions, AAD exhibits significant circadian and seasonal/monthly variations. Our findings may have important implications for the prevention of AAD by tailoring treatment strategies to ensure maximal benefits during the vulnerable periods.
