Microfibrils are macromolecular complexes associated with elastin to form elastic fibers that endow extensible tissues, such as arteries, lungs, and skin, with elasticity property. Fibrillin-1, the main component of microfibrils, is a 350-kDa glycoprotein for which genetic haploinsufficiency in humans can lead to Marfan syndrome, a severe polyfeatured pathology including aortic aneurysms and dissections. Microfibrils and fibrillin-1 fragments mediate adhesion of several cell types, including endothelial cells, while fibrillin-1 additionally triggers lung and mesangial cell migration. However, fibrillin-1-induced intracellular signaling is unknown. We have studied the signaling events induced in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) by aortic microfibrils as well as recombinant fibrillin-1 Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing fragments PF9 and PF14. Aortic microfibrils and PF14, not PF9, substantially and dose dependently increased HUVEC cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium levels measured using the fluorescent dye Fluo-3. This effect of PF14 was confirmed in bovine aortic endothelial cells. PF14 action in HUVECs was mediated by αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins, phospholipase-C, inosital 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, whereas membrane calcium channels were not or only slightly implicated, as shown in patch-clamp experiments. Finally, PF14 enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Hence, fibrillin-1 sequences may physiologically activate endothelial cells. Genetic fibrillin-1 deficiency could alter normal endothelial signaling and, since endothelium dysfunction is an important contributor to Marfan syndrome, participate in the arterial anomalies associated with this developmental disease.
