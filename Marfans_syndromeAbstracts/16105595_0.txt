We describe a new technique of aspiration of subluxated lens in young patients with Marfan's syndrome. Two small circular anterior capsulorhexis (1.5 mm to 2.0 mm) openings were created, and bimanual irrigation/aspiration was performed by introducing the irrigation cannula through 1 capsular opening and the aspiration cannula through the other. The irrigation cannula served the dual purpose of hydrating the lens matter and holding the lens in central position to ensure complete aspiration of the lens matter. The lens capsule was later removed and anterior vitrectomy performed by a vitrectomy cutter. This new technique of intralenticular irrigation/aspiration is effective and safe in performing lens aspiration in extensively dislocated crystalline lens in Marfan's syndrome.
