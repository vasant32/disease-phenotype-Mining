We describe an isolated extracardiac unruptured acquired aneurysm in the right coronary sinus of Valsalva, which was seen in a 55-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome. The patient underwent aortic root replacement using a reimplantation technique. Pathologic examination revealed absence of the medial elastic fiber of the aortic wall of the normal sinus of Valsalva. This result supports the preference of entire root replacement instead of patch repair of the affected sinus for the isolated aneurysm in 1 sinus of Valsalva in a patient with Marfan's syndrome.
