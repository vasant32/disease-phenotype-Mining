Two cases with prolapse of all four cardiac valves are described and compared with two similar ones previously reported. The severity and progression of regurgitation of each of the valves differed by case, despite having similar echocardiographic findings consistent with the diagnosis of multiple floppy valves. Two of the four patients had their aortic valve replaced because of severe regurgitation: the excised valves revealed myxomatous degeneration. None of the patients had any stigmata of Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, except for the presence of hyperextensive joints. There may be an unknown collagen disorder that caused floppiness in all the valves.
