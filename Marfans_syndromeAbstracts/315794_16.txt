Thirty-two eyes with subluxated and disclosed lenses were surgically managed by means of the vitrophage. The best results were obtained for those cases in which subluxation or dislocation of lenses into the vitreous was not associated with other complications such as glaucoma, perforating injuries, and retinal detachment. No major intraoperative or postoperative problems were seen in uncomplicated cases during a follow-up period ranging from 5 to 45 months.
