Patients with aneurysmal dissections involving both the thoracic and the abdominal aorta are particularly challenging to treat with endovascular techniques because of the natural communications at the level of the visceral arteries. We present the case of a patient with Marfan syndrome with an aneurysmal aortic dissection involving the thoracic and abdominal aorta who was treated by a combination of endografts, surgical bypass, and a fenestrated tube graft.
