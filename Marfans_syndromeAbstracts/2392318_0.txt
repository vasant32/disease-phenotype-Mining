Out of 318 aortic valve replacements performed between July 1, 1984 and June 30, 1989, aneurysm of the ascending aorta was found in 17 cases. In 7 of these cases employment of conduit was required due to the dimension of the aneurysm. In 5 cases they performed Bentall procedure: aortic valve replacement combined with conduit of the ascending aorta with the replantation of the coronaries. Based on the data of the literature and the acceptable early and late results of their own they conclude, that in case of simultaneous occurrence of aortic valve disease and aneurysm of the ascending aorta the Bentalll procedure is the method of choice.
