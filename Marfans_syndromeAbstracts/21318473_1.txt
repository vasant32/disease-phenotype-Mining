 OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of protrusio acetabuli (PA) in adults fulfilling the Ghent criteria for Marfan syndrome (MFS), and in a normal adult population. METHODS: 105 adults with probable MFS and 107 controls were included. CT of the hips was obtained. A qualitative assessment of PA was performed. A new method for estimating the degree of PA was introduced with measurement of the parameter CWD (circle-wall distance). Results were compared to an alternative method based on MRI [1]. RESULTS: 87 of the study group fulfilled the Ghent criteria of MFS (Ghent positives), and 18 did not (Ghent negatives). PA was diagnosed qualitatively in 74.7% of Ghent positive persons, in 27.8% of Ghent negative persons, and in 3.7% of the controls. CWD was significantly different between the three groups (p < 0.001). A slight but significant gender difference was found in Ghent positive persons only. The alternative method did not differentiate between the groups with respect to PA, but showed a significant difference between genders. CONCLUSIONS: PA was found significantly more often in MFS persons than in controls. Our method was found to be robust and highly reproducible, giving a direct measurement of pelvic protrusion irrespective of pelvic shape.
