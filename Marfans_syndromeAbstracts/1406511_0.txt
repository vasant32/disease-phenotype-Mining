We report on a newborn with psychomotor retardation, muscle hypotonia, typical facies, little subcutaneous fat, arachnodactyloid hands and feet, diffuse cortical and subcortical cerebral atrophy. A comparison is made with the Marfan syndrome and it is concluded that the morphoneurological anomalies are compatible with the diagnosis of Fragoso-Cant√π syndrome.
