Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue. This relatively common genetic condition affects approximately 2 to 3 per 10,000 individuals, without a particular gender, racial, geographic,or ethnic predilection. If unrecognized, patients with Marfan syndrome can have life-threatening cardiovascular complications. Identification and proper management of the disorder can improve the prognosis greatly, however, and extend the patient's life span. This article presents a case study of Marfan syndrome, describing disease characteristics and natural history, inheritance and genetics, diagnosis,differential diagnosis, and management.
