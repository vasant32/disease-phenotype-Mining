A total of 19 patients were found to have severe aortic incompetence from dysplasia of the valve (thin, spread-out valves having a tendency towards eversion). This type of valve abnormality is often unrecognized but is found in 13,6% of cases of severe aortic incompetence. The relationship between this condition and Marfan's syndrome or its aberrant forms are discussed, as well as its frequency when unrelated to this disease. The dysplasias can be isolated phenomena or associated with pathological conditions of the ascending aorta. The results of this review suggest that some of these dysplasias might be rheumatic in origin.
