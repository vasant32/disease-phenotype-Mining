We report on a patient with Marfan syndrome who presented a Stanford type B dissection of the descending thoracic aorta in late pregnancy. After a cesarean section, the patient presented a severe obstruction of the mesenteric superior artery. An endovascular fenestration was performed (balloon and guidewire based fenestration). Computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed an intussusception 'like' image of the abdominal aortic layers as a consequence of the fenestration procedure. Because of aneurismal progression in the abdominal aorta, surgical repair of the abdominal aorta and intussusception material removal was achieved six weeks later. The patient is currently in good condition. We conclude that the intussusception could be induced by a guidewire. This fenestration procedure is not recommended in patients with structural aortic disorders.
