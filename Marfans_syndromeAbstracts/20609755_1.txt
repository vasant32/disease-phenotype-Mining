 BACKGROUND: A conventional single-stage procedure, staged procedures, or debranching of the supraaortic vessels, followed by immediate transfemoral stenting of the aortic arch, have been introduced to treat chronic type B dissection with aortic arch involvement. The best method for surgical repair of chronic type B dissection with aortic arch involvement alone or concomitant with proximal aortic lesions is not known. METHODS: Between October 2003 and December 2008, 19 patients underwent total arch replacement combined with stented elephant trunk implantation under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and selective cerebral perfusion through a median sternotomy. Thirteen patients had proximal aortic lesions. Postoperative computed tomography was used to evaluate thrombosis and absorption of the false lumen. RESULTS: Concomitant proximal aortic lesions were repaired in all patients. Thirty-day mortality was 5.26% (1/19). There was one late death at a mean follow-up of 36 +/- 12 months. There was no spinal cord injury or visceral malperfusion. One patient with Marfan syndrome with chronic dissection underwent thoracoabdominal aortic replacement 6 months later. Obliteration of the false lumen around the stented elephant trunk was observed in 16 patients (94.1%, 16/17) during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is safe, effective, and economical. Replacement of aortic arch dissection and thrombosis of the dissected descending aorta was achieved simultaneously. Concomitant proximal aortic lesions were repaired. Favorable surgical outcomes and postoperative results using this technique were obtained in patients with chronic type B dissection with aortic arch involvement alone or concomitant with proximal aortic lesions.
