Mutations in the human FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome, a complex disease affecting connective tissues but with a highly variable phenotype. To identify genes that might participate in epistatic interactions with FBN1, and could therefore explain the observed phenotypic variability, we have looked for genes that are co-expressed with Fbn1 in the mouse. Microarray expression data derived from a range of primary mouse cells and cell lines were analysed using the network analysis tool BioLayout Express(3D). A cluster of 205 genes, including Fbn1, were selectively expressed by mouse cell lines of different mesenchymal lineages and by mouse primary mesenchymal cells (preadipocytes, myoblasts, fibroblasts, osteoblasts). Promoter analysis of this gene set identified several candidate transcriptional regulators. Genes within this co-expressed cluster are candidate genetic modifiers for Marfan syndrome and for other connective tissue diseases.
