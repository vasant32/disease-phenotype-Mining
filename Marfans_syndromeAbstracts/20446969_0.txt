Anterior and posterior meningoceles are the severest clinical expression of dural ectasia in patients with Marfan syndrome. Meningoceles and pseudomeningoceles have been reported from either asymptomatic, to causing headache, back pain, leg pain, radiculopathy, constipation and/or urinary symptoms. This article includes a case report of a 31-year-old woman, who presented with recurrent transient loss of consciousness thought to be secondary to acute changes in intracranial pressure transmitted from a pseudomeningocele.
