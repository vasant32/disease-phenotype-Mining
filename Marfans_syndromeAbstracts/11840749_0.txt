OBJECTIVE: To discuss the surgical techniques and therapeutic effects of phacofragmentation of the dislocated lens in the vitreous cavity. METHODS: Phacofragmentation was performed on 23 eyes of 23 patients with dislocated lens or subluxated lens in the vitreous cavity. With high suction and moderate ultrasound, the nucleus could be emulsified. Energy and time of emulsification: 50%-60% of energy was set up and emulsification spent 43 s to 3 min 23 s (mean 1 min 57 s). The pressure of maximum vacuum aspiration was 110-120 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa). In 11 eyes, anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) was implanted. Cryoapplications and encircling procedure were also performed on one eye. RESULTS: Phacofragmentation was successful in all patients. After follow-up for 5-19 months (mean 7.2 months), the corrected visual acuity was obviously improved in the cases of ACIOL and Marfan's syndrome, with 12 patients achieving visual acuity of 0.12-0.6. The major complications were corneal edema and damage of iris. CONCLUSIONS: It is demonstrated that phacofragmentation in the central vitreous cavity is safe and fairly easy procedure without adverse effects on retina and sclera. It helps to reduce intraoperative risks of alternative methods, avoiding a large opening of the anterior chamber and hypotony of the globe.
