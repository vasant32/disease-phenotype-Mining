A 78-year-old man with a traumatic giant retinal tear and phacodonesis had 3-port pars plana vitrectomy (3PPPV), lensectomy, and sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Two years after surgery, a filtration bleb was noted at 1 of the suture sites. In another case, a 32-year-old man with lens subluxation secondary to Marfan's syndrome had 3PPPV, lensectomy, and sutured posterior chamber IOL implantation. Two months after surgery, a filtration bleb was noted at 1 of the suture sites. Sutured posterior chamber IOL implantation is 1 of the few instances in which there is virtually a full-thickness suture through the sclera. We presume the filtering bleb formed as a direct result of the permanent passage created from the posterior chamber to the subconjunctiva due to presence of the suture. Presence of a filtering bleb can lead to complications including endophthalmitis.
