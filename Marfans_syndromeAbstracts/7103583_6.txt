Between 1971 and 1980, 100 patients underwent operation for ascending aortic aneurysm. Acute dissection was present in 29, chronic dissection in 11; 56 had dilatation only, and 4 had inflammatory disease of the ascending aorta. Four different operative procedures were applied independent of the type of disease: repair and reduction aortoplasty (21), reduction aortoplasty reinforced by nylon net (17), supracoronary graft replacement (42), and composite graft replacement with reimplantation of both coronary ostia (20). Early mortality was 10%, and late mortality was 12% after a mean follow-up of 45 months. Retrospective comparative analysis of the four operative methods led to the following conclusion: reduction aortoplasty supported by a tightly wrapped synthetic net is a suitable method in patients with a normal sinus of Valsalva and without dissection or inflammatory disease. Particular attention needs to be drawn to the proximal anchor stitches to avoid late net displacement. Compared with supracoronary or composite graft replacement, this method carried a lower complication rate, particularly in regard to cerebrovascular accidents and myocardial infarction. For patients with acute and chronic dissection with intact aortic root, supracoronary graft replacement is preferred, whereas in those with annuloaortic ectasia with dilated sinus of Valsalva and in all patients with Marfan's syndrome, composite graft replacement has become the procedure of choice.
