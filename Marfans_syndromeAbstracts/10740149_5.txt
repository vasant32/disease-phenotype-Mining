BACKGROUND: Patients with Marfan syndrome show a hereditary abnormality of elastin metabolism that may cause aortic enlargement and dissection. We have hypothesized that abnormal elastin may alter peripheral vascular structure and function. METHODS: Forearm blood flow (FBF) (in milliliters per minute per 100 mL) response to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine (0.75 to 4.5 microg/min per 100 mL), the endothelium-independent dilator sodium nitroprusside (0.05 to 0.3 microg/min per 100 mL), and structure-related maximum dilator response (10-minute occlusion-induced reactive hyperemia) were measured by plethysmograph in 10 patients with Marfan syndrome (mean age 44 years) and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Patients with the complications of hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, or heart failure were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Basal FBF (mean +/- SE) did not differ between the 2 groups (2.7 +/- 0.3 vs 2.3 +/- 0.4). Maximum FBF response to acetylcholine in patients with Marfan syndrome was significantly lower than that of healthy controls (8.5 +/- 2.1 vs 15.4 +/- 1.7 mL/min per 100 mL; P <.05). Reactive hyperemia was also lower in patients with Marfan syndrome (at peak 23.0 +/- 2.5 vs 29.5 +/- 2.3 mL/min per 100 mL; P <.05), but sodium nitroprusside-induced FBF changes did not differ between the 2 groups (10.3 +/- 1.1 vs 10.2 +/- 1.5 mL/min per 100 mL; P = not significant). CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that endothelium-dependent dilation and maximum dilator reserve capacity are both abnormal in peripheral resistance vessels of patients with Marfan syndrome. These peripheral vasomotion abnormalities may have a detrimental impact on the cardiovascular system in this disorder.
