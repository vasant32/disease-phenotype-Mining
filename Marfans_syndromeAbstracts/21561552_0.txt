We describe a boy with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) a genetic and recently described condition that affects connective tissues belonging to a group of Marfan-related disorders. Since there are only a few cases reported misdiagnosis may not be uncommon. Radiological findings in our patient include pectus excavatum, aortic root dilatation, diffuse dilatation of the intracerebral vessels and a Chiari I malformation. We describe the imaging findings, clinical presentation and diagnosis criteria of this entity.
