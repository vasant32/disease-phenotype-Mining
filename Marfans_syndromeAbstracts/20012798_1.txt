The first case of an infant with a dual genetic diagnosis of CHARGE and Marfan syndrome is reported here. The patient had multiple congenital anamolies, many of them consistent with CHARGE syndrome and genetic testing identified a heterozygous mutation c.3806_11del6insA in the CHD7 gene. In addition, his father had physical features consistent with Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) mutation screening identified a heterozygous c.3990insC mutation in both father and the patient.
