 BACKGROUND: Aortic valve-sparing operations are an alternative to aortic root replacement in patients with aortic root aneurysms, or aortic valve replacement and supracoronary replacement of the ascending aorta in patients with ascending aorta aneurysms and dilated sinotubular junctions with consequent aortic insufficiency. METHODS: From 1988 to 2001, 230 patients underwent aortic valve-sparing operations for aortic root aneurysms (151 patients) or ascending aortic aneurysms with aortic insufficiency (79 patients). Two types of aortic valve-sparing operations were performed in patients with aortic root aneurysms: reimplantation of the aortic valve and remodeling of the aortic root. Mean follow-up was 3.8 +/- 2.8 years. RESULTS: Patients with aortic root aneurysms were younger, had less severe aortic insufficiency, less extensive vascular disease, and better left ventricular function than patients with ascending aorta aneurysms. The 8-year survival was 83% +/- 5% for the first group and 36% +/- 14% for the second. The freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 8 years was 99% +/- 1% for the first group and 97% +/- 2% for the second. In patients who had aortic root aneurysms, 3 developed severe aortic insufficiency (AI), and 15 developed moderate AI, for an 8-year freedom from significant AI of 67% +/- 7%. But freedom from AI was 90% +/- 3% after the technique of reimplantation, and 55% +/- 6% after the technique of remodeling (p = 0.02). In patients with ascending aortic aneurysms, the freedom from AI greater than 2+ at 8 years was 67% +/- 11%. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term results of aortic valve sparing for aortic root aneurysms are excellent, and reimplantation of the aortic valve may provide a more stable repair of the aortic valve than remodeling of the aortic root.
