Composite graft replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve was performed in 78 patients over an 8 1/2-year period. Degenerative lesions of the aortic root in Marfan's syndrome (annuloaortic ectasia) was the indication for operation in 56 cases; the other 22 patients had other causes of aortic root dilatation and aortic valve disease. Overall hospital mortality was 8%. Follow-up ranged from 1-9 years (average 5 years). Reoperation was required in six of the 72 hospital survivors. Overall 5-year actuarial survival was 77%, and 85% of the survivors have shown significant clinical and radiologic improvement. Composite graft replacement reduces the risk of aneurysm formation of the sinuses of Valsalva and eliminates paraprosthetic leakage; postoperative hemorrhage is also reduced. It appears to be the method of choice for patients with degenerative lesions in the ascending aorta and valve, particularly annuloaortic ectasia.
