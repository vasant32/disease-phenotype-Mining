Pectus excavatum was repaired by the sternal eversion (turnover) technique in 26 patients over a 7-year period. Vascular supply to the sternal graft was maintained by preservation of one internal mammary vascular pedicle. Good results were obtained in 21 (81%) patients followed for periods ranging from 2 to 76 months (mean, 32 months) postoperatively. Four patients (15%) had fair results; 2 patients with Marfan's syndrome had partial recurrence, as did 1 patient with skin necrosis and 1 with hypertrophic scar. One patient (4%) had a poor early result due to wound infection and distal sternal necrosis requiring reoperation. Other complications were minor: superficial wound seroma in 2 patients and pneumothorax in 1. The sternal eversion technique for repair of pectus excavatum utilizes the concave shape of the sternum when turned over to create a cosmetically acceptable convex anterior chest wall contour. Judicious tailoring of the costal cartilages and shaping of the anterior sternum corrects asymmetrical deformities. The chest wall is very stable after repair. Since no prosthetic struts or pins are used, a second operation for removal is avoided. Preservation of the vascular supply to the sternum should allow normal growth of the anterior chest wall. The results have been sufficiently encouraging for us to recommend sternal eversion as the primary method for repair of pectus excavatum.
