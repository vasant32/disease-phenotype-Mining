 OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcome of stented elephant trunk surgery for chronic DebakeyIaortic dissection in Marfan syndrome and hypertension patients by CT. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2008, 54 patients underwent the modified stented elephant trunk procedure and total arch replacement for chronic DebakeyIaortic dissection. Twenty-two patients were made a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and the other 32 patients of hypertension. Aortic evolvement was evaluated with CT angiography by calculating the diameter ratios between the stent graft/true lumen and the aorta at the same level. RESULTS: CT study one year after discharge showed no difference in the diameter ratios of the stent and aorta at the carina level between groups (0.84 +/- 0.16 vs 0.80 +/- 0.23, P = 0.472), but had significant difference before and after surgery (0.29 +/- 0.16 vs 0.72 +/- 0.21, P < or = 0.001). And significant difference occurred at the different periods after discharge (0.72 +/- 0.21 vs 0.81 +/- 0.20, 0.81 +/- 0.20 vs 0.77 +/- 0.20, P < or = 0.001). The residual false lumen in the proximal descending aorta reached complete thrombosis in 59% of Marfan and 78% of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The modified stented elephant trunk technique is effective for closing the false lumen in the proximal descending aorta of chronic DebakeyIaortic dissection in Marfan syndrome and hypertension patients.
