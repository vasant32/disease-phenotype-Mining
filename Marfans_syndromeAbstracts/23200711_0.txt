The antenatal diagnosis of aortic dissection carries a grave prognosis. Although cases of pregnant women with Marfan syndrome have been encountered that resulted either in sudden death or emergency surgery at diagnosis, cesarean section delivery for patients who survive is associated with the risk of anesthesia and manipulation of the abdomen. Such complications can be avoided if the aortic dissection can be treated conservatively. We report the successful treatment of an aortic dissection with pharmacologic therapy and the birth of a healthy infant.
