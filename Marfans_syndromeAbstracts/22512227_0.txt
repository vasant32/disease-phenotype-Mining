Post Ross procedure complications have been limited predominantly to neoaortic valvular dilatation (10-30%) and insufficiency, right ventricular prosthetic deterioration or right ventricular pulmonary artery conduit obstruction. Arrhythmia has been documented to occur in a third of these patients. This is the first time that neoaortic right sinus of valsalva dissection and rupture to the right ventricle with a fistulous communication has occurred and been described, as far as the author is aware.
