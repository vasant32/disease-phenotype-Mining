 BACKGROUND: The anesthetic management of women with Marfan syndrome and dural ectasia undergoing Cesarean delivery remains controversial. We present two cases of patients with Marfan syndrome and dural ectasia where neuraxial anesthesia was used successfully. CASE 1: A 31-yr-old G1P0 female with Marfan syndrome presented for elective Cesarean delivery at 35(3/7) weeks' gestation. The magnetic resonance imaging of her spine revealed significant dural ectasia in the lumbosacral area with a mean lumbar dural sac area of 4.71 cm(2). Intrathecal administration of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine 9 mg produced only limited perineal analgesia. The epidural catheter was titrated, and 0.5% bupivacaine 150 mg were required to achieve a T4 sensory level. CASE 2: A 34-yr-old G1P0 female with Marfan syndrome presented for elective Cesarean delivery at 37 weeks' gestation. The intrathecal administration of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine 13.5 mg produced a T5 sensory level. Magnetic resonance imaging of her spine prior to discharge confirmed the diagnosis of moderate dural ectasia with a mean lumbar dural sac area of 3.61 cm(2). DISCUSSION: The two patients described in this report responded differently to spinal anesthesia, most likely based on the severity of their dural ectasia. Although preoperative magnetic resonance imaging may help to identify patients at risk for a failed spinal, we suggest considering a combined spinal-epidural technique in cases of dural ectasia.
