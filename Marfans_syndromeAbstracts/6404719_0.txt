Nine cases are reported who had aneurysms of the ascending aorta and aortic valve incompetence and in whom aortic valve prostheses and aortic prostheses had to be implanted. Two patients had dissecting aneurysms. In five patients, the origins of the coronary arteries were involved, and these had to be implanted into the prostheses. Chest x-rays in two planes, kymograms and CT provided the diagnosis. The most important pre-operative examination in order to assess valve function and the origins of the coronary arteries is catheter angiography.
