PURPOSE: To detect the reattachment rate and visual function outcome of Pars Plana Lensectomy, vitrectomy and scleral encircling (PPL + PPV + SE) to treat retinal detachment (RD) with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: A retrospective study of 11 cases of 14 eyes with Marfan syndrome who submitted to PPL + PPV + SE. RESULTS: All the cases were followed up for four - 46 months (means 31.2 months). Retinal reattachment rate was 85.7%, visual acuity were 0.3 or better in eight cases. CONCLUSION: PPL + PPV + SE is a safe and effective treatment for retinal detachment with Marfan syndrome.
