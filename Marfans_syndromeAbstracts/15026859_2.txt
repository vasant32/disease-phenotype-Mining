Aeromonas hydrophila is infrequently reported as a causative organism of necrotizing fasciitis. We report a case of necrotizing fasciitis due to A. hydrophila in a 44-year-old man with Marfan syndrome who underwent valve replacement surgery twice. He was admitted due to a 2-day history of fever. The fever was attributed to hepatitis, and ingestion of herbal medication was suspected to be the cause. The fever relapsed on the 28th day of hospitalization with rapidly progressive erythematous patches on the bilateral lower extremities. Septic shock developed within a few hours, and 2 small diagnostic incisions on the skin lesions suggested necrotizing fasciitis. Surgical exploration further revealed extensive necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and fascia, but the muscle was spared. Blood cultures and cultures of the debrided tissue all yielded A. hydrophila. Pathological examination showed necrosis and degeneration of the soft tissue. Although appropriately managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fasciotomies and debridement, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and resulted in death 11 hours after the surgery. This case indicates that A. hydrophila can be a causative organism of nosocomial necrotizing fasciitis.
