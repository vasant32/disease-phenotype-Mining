The fibrillin genes, FBN1 and FBN2, encode large extracellular matrix glycoproteins involved in the structure and function of microfibrils. Mutations in FBN1 are found in patients with Marfan syndrome, a heritable connective tissue disease that primarily affects the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. We extended the studies of these genes by determining their chromosomal position in the mouse genome. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between the progenitors of an interspecific backcross involving AEJ/Gn and Mus spretus mice were used to establish the segregation patterns of the murine homologs, Fbn1 and Fbn2, in the backcross progeny. The results position Fbn1 between the B2m and Illa genes on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 2 and establish its candidacy for the Tight skin (Tsk) mutation. The results position Fbn2 between the D18Mit35 and Pdgfrb loci in the central region of mouse Chr 18. Fbn2 maps near three mutations [bouncy (bc), plucked (pk), and shaker with syndactyly (sy)] and may be a candidate for the pk mutation.
