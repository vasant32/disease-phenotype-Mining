Ectopia lentis may cause a reduction in visual acuity, which varies with the type and degree of dislocation and the presence of other ocular abnormalities. Retinoscopy may reveal a significant refractive error, usually myopia and astigmatism. Occasionally, an accurate refraction may be difficult because of tilting or dislocation of the lens. If aphakic refraction improves visual acuity, an aphakic correction should be considered.
