Since 1964, 27 valve replacements have been performed in patients who ranged from 5 months to 20 years of age. Fourteen underwent aortic valve replacement, 10 underwent mitral valve replacement, two had systemic atrio-ventricular valve replacement, and one had tricuspid valve replacement. Nineteen patients had congenital heart disease, five had rheumatic disease, and three had Marfan's syndrome. Starr-Edwards prostheses were used in 17 patients, Bj√∂rk-Shiley prostheses in six, and procine xenografts in for. There were five early deaths and five late deaths. Patients were followed for 2 months to 6 years postoperatively (mean 2.1 years). All survivors showed clinical improvement. There were no episodes of thromboembolism. Minor bleeding, arrhythmias, and bacterial endocarditis occurred infrequently.
