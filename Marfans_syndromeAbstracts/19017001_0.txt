Traditional open surgical repair for aortic rupture from a thoracoabdominal pseudoaneurysm is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The use of advanced intravascular imaging and endovascular techniques permits selection and customizing endoluminal graft components to treat such catastrophic events in high-risk surgical patients. We report the successful management of a ruptured thoracoabdominal pseudoaneurysm with an endovascular approach.
