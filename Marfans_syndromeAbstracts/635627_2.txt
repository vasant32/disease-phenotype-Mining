A patient with chylothorax, mediastinal lymphangiomatous malformation of the thoracic duct, and multiple lymphangiomas of bone is reported. If a patient has radiographic findings of increased pleural fluid with multiple lucent lesions of the skeleton, the possibility of a generalized abnormality in the lymphatic system should be considered. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent a protracted course and wasting of the body due to the loss of essential body nutrients in the chylous fluid.
