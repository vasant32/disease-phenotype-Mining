A 30-year-old female with Marfan's syndrome underwent aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia and mitral valve replacement for mitral regurgitation. She remained well until 16 months postoperatively when she had sudden onset of pain. Preoperative angiogram showed Stanford B aortic dissection. Thoracoabdominal aortic replacement was performed successfully under deep hypothermic bypass.
