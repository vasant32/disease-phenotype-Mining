We present a case of recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation in a patient with Marfan's syndrome who presented with hyperlaxity that has been treated arthroscopically. We discuss abnormal findings at arthroscopic evaluation, including complete absence of the mid anterior capsule, which left the subscapularis uncovered, and we hypothesize that repetitive trauma to the capsule was not followed by a normal process of remodeling because of a lack of competent elastic fibers and a poor capacity for soft tissue healing. The inferior insertion of the labrum and the inferior glenohumeral ligament seemed normal through the large volume of the pouch. We performed arthroscopic reconstruction of the capsule through dissection of its anteroinferior part with a radiofrequency wand from the glenoid rim and the subscapularis, followed by superior drift of the capsule. The Weitbrecht foramen was then closed with 2 nonresorbable No. 4 sutures, and the capsule was reinserted to the labrum with 2 anchors. A final suture closed the remaining hole in the rotator interval. At 16-month follow-up, the patient emphasized her satisfaction with the results; she was able to keep up with her regular schedule of leisure sports and swimming, painlessly, with no limitations or new episodes of instability.
