Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage is a common adjunct to thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. CSF drainage may improve perioperative spinal cord perfusion and thereby decrease the incidence of paraplegia or paraparesis. Complications of CSF drainage may arise. We present a case of cerebral epidural hematoma (EDH), possibly arising from excessive CSF drainage, during thoracoabdominal aortic repair.
