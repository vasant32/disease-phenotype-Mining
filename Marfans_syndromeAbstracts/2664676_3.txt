Pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum deformities are not uncommon. Pectus excavatum is associated with definite demonstrable adverse physiologic effects. The psychologic impact of these deformities on the patient can be truly devastating. The clinician must realize the impact and importance of the advice given to patients and their families. Although correction of these deformities is a major surgical undertaking, it is well tolerated, safe, and usually produces a satisfactory result.
