A patient with Marfan syndrome underwent valve-preserving aortic root reconstruction with a Robicsek-Thubrikar graft. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed aortic insufficiency after extracorporeal circulation was discontinued. Placing 3 subcommissural annuloplasty sutures corrected the severe aortic insufficiency. Herein, we discuss the mechanism and prevention of aortic regurgitation after aortic root replacement with a new graft that contains pre-designed aortic sinuses.
