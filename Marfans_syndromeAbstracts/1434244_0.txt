A 12-year-old girl with Marfan syndrome was referred to our department because of severe mitral regurgitation. The patient was pale and in a pre-shock condition. The echocardiogram revealed a chordae rupture of the posteromedial papillary muscle at the posterior leaflet. A moderate dilatation of the aortic annulus (30 mm) and the ascending aorta (45 mm) without aortic regurgitation was also observed. Emergent mitral valve replacement was performed without replacement of the aortic valve or the ascending aorta. After two months, the patient developed bilateral pneumothorax, which was resistant to continuous suction therapy and finally required surgical treatments. Despite the relatively uneventful recovery, a lethal rupture of dissecting aortic aneurysm into the pericardial cavity, developed four months after the initial operation. We discussed the desired surgical approaches and respiratory problems in patients with connective tissue disorder.
