The blend of biochemistry and molecular biology required to understand the pathogenesis of genetic disease is assuming an increasing role in research. We review three example of this inevitable post-cloning trend: first, the surprising relationship between mice with albino deletions and human hereditary tyrosinemia type I; second, the discovery that choroideremia is due to defect in prenylation; and third, fibrillin mutations in the Marfan syndrome.
