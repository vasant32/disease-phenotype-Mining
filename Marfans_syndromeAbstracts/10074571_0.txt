A simple and effective new elephant trunk technique was devised and applied to two patients with a successful result. In advance before the operation, an arch graft with a skirted elephant trunk was made. This was done by inserting a smaller, 22 mm diameter sized graft into the arch graft at the distal end and suturing it so as to leave a skirt extending over the smaller graft. This configuration facilitates the distal anastomosis and effectively shortens anastomotic time.
