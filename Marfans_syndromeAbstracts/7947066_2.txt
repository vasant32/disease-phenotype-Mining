Annuloaortic ectasia and dissection of the ascending aorta are common cardiovascular complications of Marfan's syndrome. True aneurysms of the subclavian arteries in these patients are rare. We present an unusual case of a 37-year-old woman who over the span of 10 years sequentially developed an aneurysm of the ascending aorta (annuloaortic ectasia), a right subclavian artery aneurysm, a left axillary-subclavian artery aneurysm, and a dissection of the aortic arch. Aside from the aortic dissection, the aneurysms produced no symptoms. All vascular complications were detected with computed tomography and managed successfully. This case emphasizes the need for close postoperative surveillance in patients with Marfan's syndrome who have had one cardiovascular complication of the disease.
