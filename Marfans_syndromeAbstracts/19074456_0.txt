Iatrogenic acute aortic dissection is a rare, but well-known, potentially lethal complication following cardiac surgery. Iatrogenic acute aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome patients with normal aortic parameters has not been well studied. The location of the intimal tear, along the lesser curvature of the arch, poses the question if more attention should be given to this subgroup of patients. Due to their underlying aortic pathology and the nature of cardiac surgery, patients with Marfan syndrome will continue to be at greater risk than the average population.
