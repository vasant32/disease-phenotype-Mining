Twenty-five patients with Marfan syndrome underwent computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR images were interpreted in blinded fashion and then the results were compared with findings from CT scans. MR imaging was found to be equivalent to CT in the depiction of aortic, dural, and hip abnormalities in patients who had not undergone surgery. MR imaging was superior to CT in evaluation of postoperative patients because the artifact produced by Bjork-Shiley or St. Jude valves precludes adequate evaluation of the aortic root on CT scans, while producing only a small inferior field distortion, a "pseudo-ventricular septal defect," on MR images. The absence of radiation exposure is another significant advantage for the relatively young Marfan syndrome population, who require serial studies. MR imaging is the modality of choice for evaluation and follow-up of patients with Marfan syndrome and offers an appropriate means of screening their kindred.
