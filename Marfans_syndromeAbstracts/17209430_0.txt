30 exons have been analyzed using SSCP in patients with MFS or related phenotypes. We report 2 missense mutations occur in calcium-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGFcb) domains and 9 polymorphisms located both in coding and noncoding regions of FBN1 gene. Three intragenic microsatellite polymorphic markers MTS-1, MTS-2 and MTS-4 have been analyzed in patients with MFS and unrelated unaffected control individuals. We found significant differences in allele frequency distribution of MTS-2 and MTS-4 loci between MFS patients and unaffected individuals. Haplotype frequency distribution on normal and mutant chromosomes were significantly different. The most common haplotype was 2-11-8 which was predominant on normal chromosomes of affected individuals. Haplotype 2-2-8 was observed in 18% of cases on mutant chromosomes and in 4% of cases on normal chromosomes. These data demonstrate possibility and application of haplotype-segregation analysis with use of these intragenic markers for diagnostic purposes in affected families by Marfan's syndrome.
