Aneurysms of the sinuses of Valsava are neither rare nor always fatal. They are of three types: congenital, acquired, and associated with cystic medial necrosis. Each can be recognized by its characteristic appearance on plain roentgenograms and arteriography. With surgical repair, the congenital type and that which is the result of cystic medial necrosis carry a good prognosis for the patient. With the acquired type, usually syphilitic, the prognosis with conservative management is good.
