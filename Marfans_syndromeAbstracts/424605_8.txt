Aneurysm of the ascending aorta with aortic regurgitation is most commonly caused by cystic medial necrosis. Replacement of the aortic valve and diseased aorta with a composite graft and re-implantation of coronary arteries is the surgical treatment of choice at the authors' institution. The most important late complication of this procedure is hemorrhage at the anastomotic sites. Radiology plays an important role in the management of these patients. The angiographic appearance of cystic medial necrosis and the radiological features and postoperative complications of composite grafts in 15 patients are described.
