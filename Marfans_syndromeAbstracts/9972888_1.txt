BACKGROUND: In the late postoperative period after repair of an aortic dissection or dissecting aneurysm, reoperations may be required. The interval to reoperation, size and location of intimal tear, and results of reoperation were evaluated. METHODS: Between January 1982 and April 1997, 138 patients underwent surgery for Stanford type A (90 patients) or type B (48 patients) dissections of the aorta. The entire aorta was evaluated in postoperative follow-up by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for 6 months to 15 years. Reoperations were performed in 14 (10.1%) patients with changes in the aneurysms at the site of the initial repair or in the distal aorta. Selective cerebral perfusion or retrograde cerebral perfusion with deep hypothermia was used in the repair of the ascending, arch, and distal arch aneurysms. Reoperations included aortic root reconstruction (n=3), resection of a pseudoaneurysm (n=1), and replacement of the ascending aorta (n=1), arch (n=5), descending aorta (n=2), thoracoabdominal aorta (n=1), or abdominal aorta (n=1). Secondary reoperations were performed in four patients (replacement of the arch [n=2], thoracoabdominal aorta and abdominal aorta). Consequently two patients had subtotal aortic replacements. The aneurysms were caused by an anastomotic leak, a new intimal tear following aortic cross-clamping, a second intimal tear in the distal arch or abdominal aorta, and Marfan syndrome. RESULTS: Two patients (2/18 11.1%) died of bleeding or low output syndrome. Two patients died of graft infection or prosthetic valve infection 3 months after surgery respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The surgical results of reoperation for type A and B dissections were good. 2) Close postoperative follow-up of the patent false lumen in the entire aorta was necessary. 3) At the initial operation, total resection of the intimal tear in the aortic arch in low-risk patients reduced the risk of reoperation.
