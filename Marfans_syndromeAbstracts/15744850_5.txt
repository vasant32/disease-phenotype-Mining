Syringomyelia is an important cause of neurological deficit. Most cases of non-traumatic syringomyelia occur in association with a Chiari malformation. We present three unusual examples of syringomyelia with such an association. The first case is that of syringomyelia in a young woman with Marfan's syndrome, a spontaneous CSF leak and intractable intracranial hypotension. The second is a woman with long-standing lumbo-peritoneal shunt for pseudotumour cerebri who developed an acquired Chiari malformation. A young woman with a Dandy-Walker cyst that herniated into the upper cervical canal is the third case. These cases provide a basis for discussion of the pathogenesis and management of syringomyelia and the Chiari malformation in such cases.
