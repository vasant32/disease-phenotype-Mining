 PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features and surgical outcomes in a series of pediatric patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments in Taiwan. METHODS: Retrospective study of pediatric patients (age 1 to 15 years) with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment dated between January 1995 and December 2004. Patients with perforating ocular trauma were excluded. Patients were divided into four groups according to the predisposing factors: Group 1, those with congenital or developmental anomalies; Group 2, those with trauma history; Group 3, those with myopia greater than -3 D but excluding patients in Groups 1 and 2; and Group 4, the others with miscellaneous etiologies. Patients' age, sex, medical history, ocular history, type of detachment, macular status, refractive status, previous visual acuity, number and type of surgeries performed, postoperative retinal status, and current visual acuity were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-five eyes of 32 patients were included in this study. The median age was 13 years, and 75% of patients were boys. There were 17 eyes (49%) in Group 1, 8 in Group 2 (23%), 8 in Group 3 (23%), and 2 in Group 4 (6%). Bilateral retinal detachment was present in 7 patients (22%). In Group 1, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy was present in 7 eyes; retinopathy of prematurity was noted in 5 eyes; Marfan's syndrome was present in 3 eyes; mental and growth retardation was present in 2 eyes. Macula sparing retinal detachment was found in 3 eyes. Retinal attachment was achieved in 28/35 eyes. Visual recovery was modest. CONCLUSION: Congenital or developmental anomalies, myopia, and trauma were the most common risk factors for pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in Taiwan. Regular follow-up for children at risk of developing rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is necessary for early detection.
