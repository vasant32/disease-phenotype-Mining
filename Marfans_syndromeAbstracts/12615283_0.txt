The long QT and Marfan syndromes are 2 rare genetically inherited diseases with distinct pathophysiologic and genetic origins. There are no reports on the cosegregation of these 2 entities in the same family. We have identified a 4-generation family in which the Marfan syndrome segregates as an autosomal dominant trait in 6 patients. Of these 6 patients with typical features of the Marfan syndrome, 3 subjects belonging to the same collateral branch were also diagnosed with long QT syndrome. Patients were defined to be affected by the long QT syndrome if the QTc was >440 ms or if the QT segment showed abnormal morphology. They were considered as being affected by the Marfan syndrome if they fulfilled the Berlin Nosology criteria as reported by Beighton et al. The pedigree of the family is presented in Figure 1. The Marfan and the long QT syndromes segregate as an autosomal dominant disease.
