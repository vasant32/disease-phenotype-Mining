Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an autosomal dominant condition phenotypically related to Marfan syndrome (MFS). CCA is caused by mutations in FBN2, whereas MFS results from mutations in FBN1. FBN2 mRNA extracted from 12 unrelated CCA patient cell strains was screened for mutations, and FBN2 mutations were identified in six of these samples. All of the identified FBN2 mutations cluster in a limited region of the gene, a region where mutations in FBN1 produce the severe, congenital form of MFS (so-called neonatal MFS). Furthermore, three of the identified mutations occur in the FBN2 locations exactly corresponding to FBN1 mutations that have been reported in cases of neonatal MFS. These mutations indicate that this central region of both of the fibrillins plays a critical role in human embryogenesis. The limited region of FBN2 that can be mutated to cause CCA may also help to explain the rarity of CCA compared to MFS.
