Excretion of hydroxyproline with urine was studied in 16 children (5-14 years old) with Marphan-Like syndrome and Marphan, Ehlers-Dunlos and Larson syndromes after therapy involving propranolol and a complex of vitamins (ascorbic acid, riboflavin and pyridoxine) and recommended on the basis of echocardiographic analyses. The therapeutic course appears to cause quantitative and qualitative correction of collagen and apparently of elastin fibrilles development. Depending on initial patterns of hydroxyproline excretion and the syndrome form the correction could be complete or partial, while positive effect of the treatment was stable or provisional. The data obtained suggest that the complex treatment developed might be applied as a preoperative therapy of the patients with Marphan-like syndrome as well as with syndromes of Marphan and Ehlers-Dunlos before thoracoplastics caused by hereditary chest deformation and by impairments of cardiovascular system.
