Life-threatening cardiovascular manifestations of Marfan's syndrome are rare in young children. The authors report the case of a 4 1/2-year-old girl with Marfan's syndrome who had a large aneurysm of the ascending aortic valve replaced and both coronary arteries implanted into a prosthetic graft (Bentall's procedure). Other published reports of children with aortic aneurysms due to Marfan's syndrome are reviewed.
