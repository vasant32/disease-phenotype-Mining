We analyzed the long-term results of aortic root replacement with a composite graft. Since 1992, 127 patients had undergone aortic root replacement with a composite graft. There were 92 men and 35 women with a mean age of 56.5 years. There were 69 patients with annuloaortic ectasia, 17 aortic dissections, and 41 ascending aortic dilatation due to aortic valve disease. Marfan syndrome was diagnosed in 19 patients. As surgical procedure, button technique was used in 90 patients, Cabrol technique in 11, and Piehler technique in 26. Open distal anastomosis was performed in 82 patients to avoid clamp injury of rest aorta. Early mortality was 3.1% and no major morbid events had occurred. Follow-up was completed in 95.9% of the patients and the mean follow-up period was 6.1 years. Actuarial survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 86.2%, 83.4%, and 83.4%, respectively. Actuarial freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 10 and 15 years was 99.2% and 95.7%, respectively. The results of aortic root replacement with a composite graft were excellent. This procedure should be the 1st choice for surgical treatment of the aortic root disease.
