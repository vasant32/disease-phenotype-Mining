This report discusses the case histories of two patients who had had previous cardiac operations and required extensive reoperations including mitral valve replacement. In both patients the replacement of the mitral valve was performed through the aortic root. This rare approach to the mitral valve, conducted with remarkable facility in these patients, encourages more liberal use of transaortic mitral valve operations in selected patients.
