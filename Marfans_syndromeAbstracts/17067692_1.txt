In women with Marfan syndrome pregnancy increases the risk of aortic dissection. There are a number of articles reporting the outcome of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy in this patient group. In contrast, only scarce information is available concerning pregnancy in patients with pre-existing chronic aortic dissection. We report the case of a pregnant Marfan syndrome patient with pre-existing chronic aortic dissection that showed a favourable maternal and fetal outcome.
