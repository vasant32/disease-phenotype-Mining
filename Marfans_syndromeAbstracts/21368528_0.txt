A home pediatric patient with artificial respirator has little chance to go out. The primary reasons are as follows: (1) Lack of experience in controlling the situation by the family when artificial respirator related troubles occur. (2) Whenever the patient wants to go out, no caregiver is available for assistance. (3) Going-out is just a psychological burden for the patient and family. (4) Availability of receiving institutions for a patient who needs an emergency care. Hence, a caregiver should improve not only the patient's ADL but also establishes a system that provides a satisfactory care for the patient and family. In doing so, the caregiver's role is important more than ever.
