The skin fibroblasts from people with the inherited metabolism diseases were studied by the methods of electron microscopy, light autoradiography and morphometric analysis. Comparison of morphological and morphometric data for the structure of the protein-synthesizing apparatus of the normal and deficient fibroblasts showed a significant role of the posttranslational regulation level of the basic specific syntheses in deficient fibroblasts.
