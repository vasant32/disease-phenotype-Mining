Marine turtles were found to have gross aortic aneurysmal dilations and multiple, raised grayish-white plaques which resembled both the aortic lesions of Marfan's syndrome in humans and those induced by chemical manipulation in animals. Smooth muscle cells in these aortic lesions displayed considerable functional as well as morphological similarity in their response to environmental injury in both turtles and humans.
