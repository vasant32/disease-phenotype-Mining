Many craniofacial and dental anomalies have a genetic background. Much research related to the molecular pathology of genetic conditions is being carried out, and new information related to mapping of disease genes, gene identification, and mutations in these genes is accumulating with incredible speed. It is important to be well informed of the molecular background of the conditions that we treat at anomaly clinics. This article reviews the most recent molecular findings related to Turner syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, cleidocranial dysplasia, and cleft lip and palate.
