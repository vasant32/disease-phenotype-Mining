Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited disorder of connective tissue caused by mutations in the gene for ﬁbrillin-1 (FBN1). The complex pathogenesis of MFS involves changes in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Fibrillin-1 and elastin have repeated Gly-x-x- Pro-Gly (GxxPG) motifs that can induce a number of effects including macrophage chemotaxis and increased MMP activity by induction of signaling through the elastin-binding protein (EBP). In this work, we test the hypothesis that antagonism of GxxPG fragments can suppress disease progression in the Marfan aorta. Fibrillin-1 underexpressing mgR/mgR Marfan mice were treated with weekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of an antibody directed against GxxPG fragments. The treatment was started at 3 weeks of age and continued for 8 weeks. The treatment signiﬁcantly reduced MMP-2, MMP-9 and pSmad2 activity, as well as fragmentation and macrophage inﬁltration in the aorta of the mgR/mgR mice. Additionally, airspace enlargement and increased pSmad2 activity in the lungs of mgR/mgR animals were prevented by the treatment. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the important role of secondary cellular events caused by GxxPG-containing fragments and matrix-induced inﬂammatory activity in the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) in mgR/mgR mice. Moreover, the results of the current study suggest that antagonism of the effects of GxxPG fragments may be a fruitful therapeutic strategy in MFS.
