BACKGROUND: Reimplantation of the native, structurally intact aortic valve within a Dacron tube graft in patients with aortic root aneurysms corrects annular ectasia and dilatation of the sinotubular junction. The durability of this valve repair with respect to the increased mechanical stress on valve cusps has been discussed, is quite controversial, and is yet unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: From July 1993 to November 1998, a replacement of the ascending aorta with a repair of the aortic valve was performed in 75 patients (53 men and 22 women aged 50+/-19 years). Twenty-one patients (28%) had Marfan syndrome, and 11 patients (15%) had an aortic dissection, type Stanford A (6 acute, 5 chronic). In 17 patients (23%), concomitant replacement of the aortic arch was necessary. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was performed in 6- to 12-month intervals for a cumulative study period of 137 patient-years. No operative deaths occurred. Two patients (3%) died 5 and 20 months postoperatively. One additional patient experienced a transient ischemic attack within the first postoperative week. Three patients (4%) with progressive aortic insufficiency required aortic valve replacement after 9, 11, and 14 months. All other patients had no or mild aortic insufficiency. The repairs have now remained stable for </=65 months (mean, 22+/-20 months). Other valve-related complications did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this type of aortic valve repair achieves excellent results in selected patients. Perfect coaptation of valve cusps during the repair with no or only trace aortic insufficiency at initial echocardiography seems to be essential for durability.
