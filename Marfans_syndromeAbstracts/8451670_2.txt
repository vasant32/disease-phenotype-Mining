Six patients with Marfan's syndrome were included in a study to determine the effect of beta-blockers on progressive aortic dilation. Patients' histories and results of physical examination, chest radiogram, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram are reported. Patients ranged in age from 5 years 8 months to 14 years; one was black, five were white, and four were male. The study included a brother and sister whose mother had had Marfan's syndrome and died at age 32. All six patients had aortic dilatation documented by echocardiography; two also had mitral valve prolapse. Auscultatory findings were unrevealing, but patients showed easy fatigability. During the prospective, randomized study, half of the patients were given beta-blockers; the other half formed a control group. Findings at short to midterm follow-up suggest that beta-blockers are beneficial in arresting progressive dilatation of the aorta.
