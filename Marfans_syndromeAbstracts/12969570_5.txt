Marfan's Syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant condition resulting in a generalised weakness of the supporting tissues of the body. In its classical form it is associated with abnormalities of the eye, the skeletal system and the cardiovascular system. The prevalence of classical Marfan's Syndrome is 4-6 per 100,000 people. It has significant implications for affected women who are contemplating pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach involving the specialities of maternal fetal medicine, cardiology and clinical genetics is optimal for provision of care to women with Marfan's Syndrome.
