In order to further understand the role of fibrillin-1 (FBN1, OMIM 134797) perturbations in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome (MFS, OMIM 154700) we studied a Han Chinese family in which MFS was segregating. In the Chinese family with 5 affected members, mutation screening for FBN1 was performed using direct sequencing. A novel non-synonymous mutation in the transforming growth factor beta binding protein-like (TB) domain of the FBN1 gene was found. The missense mutation c.3022T>C (C1008R) located in exon 24. This mutation was present in the proband and in two other affected family members, but in neither unaffected family members nor unrelated control subjects. The novel non-synonymous mutation, c.3022T>C (C1008R) in the TB domain of FBN1 gene, may be involved in the pathogenesis of MFS in a Han Chinese family.
