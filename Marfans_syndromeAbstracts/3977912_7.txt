The most abundant amine in acid hydrolysates of human skin, eluting in the crosslink region of a reversed-phase HPLC chromatogram, has the same retention time as pyridinoline standard. This amine is not pyridinoline, since it is a weak fluorophore and its U/V spectrum does not agree with that of pyridinoline. The unknown amine was isolated and characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and its structure is consistent with a deoxy-analogue of pyridinoline. It may be a crosslink component of some biological importance, since it is not detectable in skin from a patient with Marfan's Syndrome.
