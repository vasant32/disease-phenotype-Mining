Surgical treatment of scoliosis associated with Marfan syndrome poses a challenge to spine surgeons. This retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether posterior-only surgery with instrumented fixation and fusion addresses the correction of scoliosis and maintains curve correction. Twelve consecutive patients with Marfan syndrome were treated between 2002 and 2007 for scoliosis by posterior segmental instrumentation using pedicle screws or hybrid thoracic-hook and lumbar-screw constructs. Their preoperative Cobb angle averaged 66 ± 10° (range: 55-90°). The average operation time was 252 ± 36 min (range: 200-300 min) and the average blood loss was 690 ± 117 ml (range: 550-920 ml). No significant complications were found. All the patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years (range: 2.4-6.8 years). The average Cobb angle was corrected to 23 ± 8° (range: 13-35°) immediately after surgery and 28 ± 9° (range: 14-43°) with a correction rate of 58 ± 13% at final follow-up. The results indicate that posterior-only surgery with instrumented fixation and fusion is effective and safe for the treatment of scoliosis in selected patients with Marfan syndrome.
