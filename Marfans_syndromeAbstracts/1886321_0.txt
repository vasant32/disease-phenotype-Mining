A case of the elder PDA with aneurysm of the main pulmonary artery is reported. The patient was a 59-year-old female who had been suffering from severe heart failure. The PDA was closed directly from inside of the pulmonary artery using balloon catheter under usual cardiopulmonary bypass with limited circulatory arrest, and the aneurysm was repaired by aneurysmorrhaphy. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged after 34 postoperative days. The pathological finding of the aneurysm of the main pulmonary artery is a cystic mucoid degeneration like a finding of Marfan syndrome. The etiology of the aneurysm of the main pulmonary artery seems to be extended Ao-PA shunt besides somewhat congenital change of the pulmonary artery.
