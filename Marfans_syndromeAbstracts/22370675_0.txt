We present two patients with Marfan syndrome and bilateral crystalline lens dislocation who underwent bilateral lens extraction and Artisan aphakia intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. With a follow-up of more than 12 years, we found a good visual outcome, no serious IOL-related complications, and endothelial cell densities within the expected range for eyes without cataract surgery.
