Amino acid chromatography was used for determination of the elastin-specific amino acids desmosine and isodesmosine in acid hydrolyzates of intima-medial samples taken intraoperatively from aneurysms of human ascending aorta. Elastin concentration of the specimens was also estimated by hot alkali extraction followed by nitrogen determination of the extracted material and the insoluble residue. All patients studied had annulo-aortic ectasia i.e., dilatation of the aortic annulus and the ascending aorta. Two patients with the Marfan syndrome had low aortic elastin concentration determined by both methods. A third Marfan syndrome patient, youngest of the three, also had a slightly reduced concentration of elastin in the aorta. Aortic samples were studied from five patients who did not have the classical Marfan syndrome. Two patients of those five had decreased aortic elastin concentration. The change in elastin concentration was accompanied by high hydroxyproline/proline or hydroxylysine/lysine ratios which indicates that the proteins of the aneurysmatic aortic wall contained more collagen than the proteins of the control aortic wall. These findings point to a change in the structure or metabolism of elastin in the aortic wall in the Marfan syndrome and at least in some other patients with annulo-aortic ectasia.
