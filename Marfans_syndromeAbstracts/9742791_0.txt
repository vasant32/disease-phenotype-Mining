Between 1985 and 1992, 28 patients of acute type A aortic dissection were operated on at our department. Our surgical strategy for this disease is "limited aortic resection", that is to avoid replacement of the entire arch except for the patients with arch tear that cannot be resected without total arch replacement. There were one operative mortality due to post transfusion GVHD, and ten late mortality (rupture of the residual dissecting aneurysm 3; complication of the late reoperation 3; cerebrovascular disease 2; pulmonary infection 2). Actuarial survival rate of all cases is 92.9%, 62.9%, and 58.4% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Comparing the patients whose primary tear was resected or not resected, there was no difference in the rate of residual dissection (12/16, 75% vs 5/6, 83.3%; primary tear resected vs not resected), the rate of late reoperation (3/16, 18.8% vs 1/6, 16.7%), nor actuarial survival rate (90.5% vs 100%, 66.7% vs %, 53.6% vs 71.4%, at 1, 5, 10 years, respectively). There were three cases with Marfan's syndrome, and all three cases died of the rupture of the residual dissection. We will follow the policy of the "limited aortic resection" unless the operative mortality of the entire arch replacement is proved as good as that of the ascending or hemiarch replacement. Because of the poor late results of the patients with Marfan's syndrome, entire arch replacement at the initial surgery and aggressive reoperation for the residual dissection is necessary.
