We herein review our 17-year surgical experience for the treatment of ascending aortic aneurysm in patients with Marfan syndrome to clarify the risks of increased mortality and reoperation. The subjects consisted of 15 patients who had all undergone surgery for the aortic root and ascending aorta at Niigata University Hospital between July 1978 and January 1995. Aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic wrapping were performed in 5 patients, Bentall or Cabrol operation in 6, and combined aortic arch reconstruction and Cabrol operation in 2, as the initial surgery. Patients who had an aortic dissection (Stanford type A) at initial surgery were assigned to group I (n = 7), while those with an aortic root aneurysm were assigned to group II (n = 8). In group I, 3 patients required a second operation for the remaining aortic arch aneurysm, and 1 died due to a late rupture of the distal aneurysm. In group II, no patient needed a reoperation; however, 1 died due to an intracranial hemorrhage and another due to composite valve graft failure and distal dissection. The results thus indicate that aortic dissection seems to affect long-term outcome, and therefore the combined repair of the aortic root and transverse arch is recommended in Marfan patients with aortic dissection involving the transverse aortic arch.
