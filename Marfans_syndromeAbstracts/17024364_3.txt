In order to test the hypothesis that polymorphisms of the Marfan syndrome gene (FBN1) might affect the stature (height) of normal individuals, we genotyped three exonic SNPs on 428 males, 219 with tall stature (>2 SD) and 209 with normal stature (within +/-1 SD). One of the SNPs, rs8033037, in exon 15 showed a significant correlation (P = 0.0061) with the adult height, suggesting that FBN1 is one of the 'stature genes' of normal individuals.
