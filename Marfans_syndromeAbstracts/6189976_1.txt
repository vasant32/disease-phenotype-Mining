An 18-year-old boy showed childhood onset of mental retardation, neurogenic muscle atrophy with hyperreflexia, Marfan-like features, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, increased urinary excretion of dermatan sulfate, and decreased lysosomal enzyme activities in beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. This case may be a new syndrome, the combination of neurogenic muscle atrophy with lysosomal enzyme deficiencies.
