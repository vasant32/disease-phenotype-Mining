Marfan syndrome represents a heterogeneous connective tissue disease, the symptoms arising in several tissues and organs. The defective gene(s) behind this autosomal dominant condition has not been found despite considerable research. The main targets of the research have been the genes coding for connective tissue components. Several of the candidate genes suspected to be defective in Marfan syndrome are located on the long arm of chromosome 2. These genes include a cluster of two genes coding for fibrillar collagens COL3A1 and COL5A2, and a third member of the collagen gene family: COL6A3. Furthermore, genes for elastin (ELN) and fibronectin (FN) are also located in this area of chromosome 2. We studied this chromosomal area using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analysis in five Finnish Marfan families with affected members in three generations. In two point linkage analyses, Lod scores of -3.192 (theta = 0.1) to COL3A1, -1.683 (theta = 0) to COL6A3 and -2.664 (theta = 0.01) to FN were obtained, whereas the linkage analysis between elastin and the disease was non-informative (Lod score 0.444, theta = 0). With the multipoint linkage analysis that permits simultaneous examination of several loci and more efficient use of family data, we obtained an exclusion of all these loci as the site of the mutation leading to Marfan syndrome in these families.
