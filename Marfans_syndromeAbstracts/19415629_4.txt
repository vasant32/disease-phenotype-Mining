Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) is a multifunctional growth factor involved in wound healing, tissue fibrosis, and in the pathogenesis of many syndromic diseases (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Camurati-Engelmann disease) and muscular, neurological, ophthalmic, cardiovascular and immunological disorders, and cancer. Since the generation of Tgfb1 knockout mice, there has been extraordinary progress in understanding its physiological and pathophysiological function. Here, we report the generation of a conditional knockout allele for Tgfb1 in which its exon 6 is flanked with LoxP sites. As proof of principle, we crossed these mice to LckCre transgenic mice and specifically disrupted Tgfb1 in T cells. The results indicate that T-cell-produced TGFbeta1 is required for normal in vivo regulation of peripheral T-cell activation, maintenance of T-cell homeostasis, and suppression of autoimmunity.
