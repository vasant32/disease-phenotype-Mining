Fibrillin-1 is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein which assembles to form 10-12 nm microfibrils in extracellular matrix. Mutations in the human fibrillin-1 gene (FBN-1) cause the connective tissue disease Marfan syndrome and related disorders, which are characterised by defects in the skeletal, cardiovascular and ocular systems of the body. Fibrillin-1 has a striking modular organisation which is dominated by multiple tandem repeats of the calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domain. This review focuses on recent studies which have investigated the structural and functional role of calcium binding to cbEGF domains in fibrillin-1 and 10-12 nm microfibrils.
