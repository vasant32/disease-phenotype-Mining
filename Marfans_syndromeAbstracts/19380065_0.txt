Given the complexity and diversity of congenital differences, a separate and broad category of generalized skeletal abnormalities was proposed to include all conditions that are unable to be neatly packaged into the other categories. Some of the conditions included in this category are obscure, whereas others are more common. Some conditions listed in this section may fit into other categories but may be considered as part of the overall classification scheme. This article presents congenital trigger finger, congenital clasped thumb, Madelung's deformity, and other skeletal hand deformities that are characteristic of generalized bone and connective tissue disorders, including achondroplasia and Marfan syndrome.
