Twenty-four patients with aortic regurgitation secondary to aortic root aneurysm (13 patients) or dissection (11 patients) were operated on, utilizing a variety of surgical procedures to cope with the varied pathological findings. These ranged from primary repair of the ascending aorta without any prostheses in patients with acute aortic dissection to replacement of the valve and the entire ascending aorta for aortic root aneurysm. In four patients with Marfan syndrome the right coronary artery was transplanted to the ascending aortic graft, allowing an extension of the graft to the valve anulus and excision of the entire aneurysmal aorta. The immediate and late results have been most encouraging.
