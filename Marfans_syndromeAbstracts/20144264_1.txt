 PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta receptors II gene (TGFBR2) mutations associated with Marfan syndrome and Marfan-associated disorders have been investigated. However, such studies are limited in China. To obtain more information about TGFBR2 mutations, we analyzed 6 unrelated Chinese patients with Marfan-associated disorders and without ocular manifestation. METHODS: The genomic DNA from blood leukocytes of these 6 patients and their relatives was isolated, and the entire coding region of TGFBR2 was amplified using PCR. We determined the sequence of TGFBR2 with the ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. RESULTS: Three mutations were identified in TGFBR2. Two mutations were associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), which were distributed as following: one missense mutation R528C (caused by a 1582C > T substitution) and one polymorphism T315M (a rare SNP). The third mutation was a novel silent mutation associated with MFS2, which was K291K caused by an 873 C > T substitution. CONCLUSIONS: The TGFBR2 gene missense mutations are possibly causative mutations of Loeys-Dietz syndrome. This result suggests an increase in the mutation spectrum of Marfan-related disorders in China and possibly world-wide.
