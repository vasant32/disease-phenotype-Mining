We report the cases of 3 patients with Marfan's syndrome with a wide range of clinical signs and severe cardiovascular involvement. The first case was an 18-year-old man who received general anesthesia during laparotomy for acute abdomen. Surgery was uneventful, even though emergency conditions precluded a full preoperative workup. In the second case (herniorrhaphy in a 36-year-old man) and the third (total hip replacement in a 23-year-old woman), surgery was scheduled, permitting heart function testing, assessment of previous treatment, premedication and adjustment of length of the surgical table. Surgery was likewise uneventful in the second and third cases.
