Marfan's syndrome is a rare inborn error of metabolism. Marfan patients are prone to aneurysms of the ascending aorta and run a high risk of rupture of the aortic arch. The diameter of the aneurysm is the most important predictor of the risk and therefore the leading point for surgical interventions. IV and IA-DSA according to our experiences are simple and effective methods in pre- and postoperative evaluation of patients with the syndrome.
