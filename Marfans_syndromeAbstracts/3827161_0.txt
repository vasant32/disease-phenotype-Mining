The aim of this study is to show the clinical value of the echocardiography in the heritable disorders of connective tissue, within a series of 10 cases, from 7,500 echocardiograms reviewed between 1978 and 1985. Echocardiography visualized an aneurysm of the ascending aorta in three patients, a dilatation of the pulmonary artery in one case, a mitral valve prolapse in six patients associated with an aortic and tricuspid valve prolapse in two cases, and a tricuspid valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation in one case. In two patients, an aortic valve prolapse was isolated. Other echocardiographic features were intracardiac calcifications (4 cases), septal hypertrophy (2 cases) and an incompetent foramen ovale (2 cases). Echocardiographic examination must be performed in all connective tissue diseases because cardiovascular complications are responsible for the vast majority of deaths. Conversely, all the patients with valvular prolapse, dilatation of the great vessels, aneurysm of the sinuses of Valsalva or congenital heart defects type incompetent foramen ovale should be suspected of connective tissue disorders. Such diagnosis is crucial when a surgical intervention is being considered because of the fragility of the tissues.
