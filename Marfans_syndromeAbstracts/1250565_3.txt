The patient described had the Marfan syndrome complicated by a 22-week pregnancy. Because pregnancy potentiates the cardiovascular complications of aortic aneurysm or dissection and there is a 50% risk of having a child afflicted with the disorder, this pregnancy was electively terminated by hysterotomy along with a bilateral tubal ligation. The risks of pregnancy to a woman with the Marfan syndrome are reviewed. The rationale for the method of pregnancy termination chosen is discussed.
