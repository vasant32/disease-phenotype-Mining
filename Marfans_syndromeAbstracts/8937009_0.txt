We performed the modified Bentall procedure for annuloaortic ectasia in a 41-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome. Approximately 15 minutes after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass with an arterial delivery via the left common femoral artery, perfusion volume gradually decreased and the abdomen of the patient was distended. Retrograde dissection was strongly suggested. Perforation and localized dissection of the left common iliac artery were recognized. Following repair of the lesion, the modified Bentall operation was carried out. Postoperative course was uneventful. The patient has been well for 22 months after the operation.
