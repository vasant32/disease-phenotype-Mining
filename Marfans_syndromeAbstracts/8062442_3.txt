A 13-year-old male presented with new onset seizures, sagittal sinus thrombosis with cerebral hemorrhage, and extensive venous thrombosis of the lower limbs. Laboratory investigation demonstrated combined deficiency of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III. He and his 17-year-old sister had a mental retardation-multiple anomaly syndrome associated with microcephaly, unusual facies, and lax connective tissue. Their dysmorphology included elongated faces with narrow forehead, arched eyebrows, large mouth with down-turned corners, malformed teeth, and furrowed tongue. Both had Marfanoid habitus with lax joints, pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis, and flat narrow feet. The most likely diagnosis for these siblings is the autosomal recessive Cohen syndrome of mental retardation, congenital hypotonia with Marfanoid habitus, microcephaly, pleasant affect, micrognathia, and open mouth with prominent incisors. The sagittal sinus thrombosis, left frontal intracranial hemorrhage, carotid aneurysm, tortuous descending aorta, and deep venous thrombosis suffered by the male sibling adds the Cohen syndrome to genetic vasculopathies that may be associated with stroke.
