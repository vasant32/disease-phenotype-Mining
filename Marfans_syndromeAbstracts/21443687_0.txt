 AIM: To assess the effect of beta-blockade therapy on progressive aortic dilatation and on clinical outcome in children and adolescents with Marfan's syndrome (MFS). METHODS: The meta-analysis was instituted, which included studies identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE of peer-reviewed publications. Echocardiogram measurements of the aortic root dimension and outcome measures of mortality and major morbidity were compared between patients who were treated and untreated with beta-blockade therapy. RESULTS: Five studies were included. A total of 224 young patients treated with beta-blocker therapy and 168 patients did not accept medical management. Compared with non-beta-blockade treatment, beta-blockade therapy significantly decreased the rate of aortic dilatation (SMD = -1.30 with 95% CI -2.11 to -0.49). A tendency of clinical outcome beneficial was observed in the beta-blocker treatment group when compared with no beta-blocker treatment group (odds ratio = 0.87 with 95% CI 0.37-2.04). CONCLUSION: There is evidence that beta-blockade therapy can slow down the rate of dilatation of the aorta and has clinical benefits on children and adolescents with MFS.
