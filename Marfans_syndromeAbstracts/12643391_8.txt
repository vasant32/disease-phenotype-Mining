BACKGROUND: This study assesses the durability and clinical outcome of valve-sparing aortic root reconstruction using the reimplantation technique in a single center cohort. METHODS: From July 1993 to July 2001, 158 patients underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with native valve reimplantation. Mean age of patients was 52 +/- 17 years (9 to 84 years), 103 were men (65%). Thirty-four patients (22%) suffered from Marfan's syndrome. Aortic dissection Stanford type A was present in 29 patients (19%) (22 acute, 7 chronic), and concomitant partial or total arch replacement was necessary in 57 patients (36%). One or more additional procedures were performed in 28 patients (18%). Mean follow-up was 36 +/- 25 months (0.4 to 96 months). RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 3.8% (6 patients), but only 2.2% in elective patients. Mean bypass time was 169 +/- 50 minutes (99 to 440 minutes), aortic cross-clamp time was 129 +/- 31 minutes (79 to 205 minutes). In patients undergoing arch replacement, circulatory arrest was 26 +/- 18 minutes (7 to 99 minutes). During follow-up, there were 5 (3.3%) cardiac-related late deaths. Grade of aortic insufficiency (AI) decreased from 2.3 +/- 1.1 (0 to 4) preoperatively to 0.23 +/- 0.44 (0 to 2) postoperatively (p < 0.0001). Six patients required aortic valve replacement, 4 of those due to progressive AI. Average grade of AI increased significantly to 0.42 +/- 0.61 (0 to 3) at latest evaluation (p = 0.002). Two patients experienced a transient ischemic attack within the first postoperative week. No further thromboembolic complications were noticed. All patients presented with a favorable exercise tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: The aortic valve reimplantation technique achieves excellent clinical outcome with few complications even in complex pathologies. Lack of anticoagulation and favorable durability encourage wider and earlier use of this technique.
