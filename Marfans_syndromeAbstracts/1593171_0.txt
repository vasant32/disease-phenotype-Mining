Two cases of spontaneous pneumothorax in the patients of Marfan Syndrome were reported. Nine and 13-year-old girls were admitted to our hospital complaining of chest pain and dyspnea for the first time. Tension pneumothorax was confirmed by the chest radiograph. Both of them had the physical stigmata of Marfan Syndrome including cardiovascular abnormalities. The drainage tube was inserted into the thoracic cavity. As the drainage was ineffective, the surgical treatment was undertaken. The thoracic cavity was opened though axillary incision and bullae were resected. The patient of pneumothorax with the Marfan Syndrome should be examined preoperatively about cardiovascular abnormality using chest computed tomography and echocardiography. As far as the surgical intervention was concerned, the axillary approach is preferred to the median sternotomy, as such patient highly probably require cardiovascular operation in future.
