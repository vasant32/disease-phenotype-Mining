True aneurysm of the coronary artery in Marfan syndrome is very rare. We present a patient with Marfan syndrome who had aneurysms from the ascending aorta to the thoracoabdominal aorta and a large aneurysm of the left main coronary artery after an original Bentall operation. Prosthetic graft replacement of total aorta, coronary artery bypass grafting, and removal of the aneurysm of the left main coronary artery were successfully performed.
