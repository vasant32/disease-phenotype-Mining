The splanchnic aneurysms, which are complicated by rupture in 25% of cases with a mortality of 25-70%, are usually a surprise during diagnostic tests for other abdominal pathologies or emergency laparotomies. 10 cases treated (8 in elective and 2 in emergency surgery) are presented here: the aneurysm was in celiac trunk (1 patient), common hepatic artery (1 pt.), hepatic artery (2 pts.), gastroduodenal artery (1 pt.), superior mesenteric artery (1 pt.), inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (1 pt.), right colic artery (1 pt.) and inferior mesenteric artery (1 pt.). There were 1 case of Marfan syndrome and 9 cases of atherosclerosis, 4 of which arteries presenting hyperdynamic flow consequent to occlusions of the superior mesenteric artery and/or the celiac trunk. The 2 cases operated on for hemoperitoneum underwent aneurysmectomy and ligation of the inflow vessels (1 death from pulmonary embolism on 5th postoperative day), whereas the 8 cases electively treated (with no deaths and I case of transient diarrhoeal syndrome) underwent 4 aneurysmal resections with end-to-end arterial reconstruction, 3 PTFE-graft substitutions and 1 autologous saphenous vein substitution. At follow-up (12-74 months; mean 30.6) all the reconstructions resulted successful. These data confirm the consistent indications of the recent Literature suggesting the indication to the surgical treatment of the incidental aneurysms in the splanchnic area.
