We report the management of a patient with Marfan's syndrome for labor analgesia and vaginal delivery using a combined spinal-epidural technique. The rapid onset of analgesia for the first stage of labor provided by the intrathecal opioid, combined with the slow and controlled onset of sensory anesthesia and sympathetic block provided by the dilute epidural local anesthetic, may make this technique particularly useful for labor and delivery in patients with Marfan's syndrome.
