We describe the first Marfan syndrome case of non-traumatic bilateral radial artery aneurysms in the anatomical snuff box. A 74-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome had a pulsatile mass in her bilateral anatomical snuff box. The color Doppler ultrasonography showed an aneurysm of radial artery located in the bilateral anatomical snuff box. Resection of the right radial artery aneurysm was completed without complications. Histopathological analysis showed a true aneurysm with atherosclerotic changes in the arterial wall. We review the literature on non-traumatic or bilateral radial artery aneurysm in the anatomical snuff box, and discuss the clinical presentation and surgical management.
