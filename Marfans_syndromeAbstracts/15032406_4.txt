Between May 1980 and May 2000, 150 patients (123 males and 27 females) underwent surgery with the same surgeon for ascending aortic replacement with a valvular conduit and coronary reimplantation with the aid of a collar of aortic wall (button technique). The average age was 50 +/- 16 years. Within this population, 114 patients had isolated annulo-ectasial disease, 36 had Marfan syndrome and 20 had dissection (5 acute and 15 chronic). A carbon fibre valve with 2 leaflets was implanted in 124 patients, a mono-leaflet valve in 20 and 6 others required a heterograft due to their age or a contra-indication to anticoagulation. The associated procedures were: 12 arch replacements, 5 myocardial revascularisations, 4 mitral replacements, 1 tricuspid plasty, 1 inter-atrial communication closure. In 30 patients (20%) there was a cardiovascular surgical re-intervention. The operative and first month mortality amounted to one sudden death on the 19th day, ie 0.6%. Three patients were lost to follow up. The average survival was 7.87 +/- 5.37 years (minimum 1, maximum 20 years). The actuarial survival was 85% at 10 years and 60% at 20 years. These figures are much higher than those reported in our previous statistics from 1994 when the percentage of survivors at 12 years was only 61%. In the group of patients undergoing surgery before 60 years of age, the survival at 14 years was 94% and 81% at 20 years. Only four late re-interventions were attributable to the Bentall procedure, of which 2 were left coronary ostium stenoses. The rate of thrombosis and embolism was 0.42 per 100 patient-years and the rate of haemorrhagic accidents was identical, including minor accidents. This considerable improvement in long-term prognosis is explicable by the adoption of a single operative technique, considered to be the best, with the best myocardial protection thanks to coronary retro-perfusion and cold or hot cardioplegia, and also without doubt with the best medical survival.
