Although the prognosis for a person with the Marfan syndrome is much more favorable than it was a decade ago, this remains a serious and burdensome condition.

Management focuses on recognizing abnormalities and altering the natural history of each clinical manifestation at as young an age as possible. The family physician must be current with therapy and counseling.
