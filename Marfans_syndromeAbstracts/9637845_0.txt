A 51-year-old man with annuloaortic ectasia and aortic regurgitation, who did not have Marfan syndrome, underwent an aortic valve-sparing root reconstruction (remodeling). All three sinuses were excised and then the ascending aorta was replaced with a 30 mm collagen-impregnated Dacron graft, one of which ends were scalloped to reproduce pseudosinus. Each coronary artery orifice was anastomosed to the graft with Carrel patch method. Post-operative angiogram showed no aortic regurgitation and no pseudosinus formation, because the graft was slightly larger than the optimal one. The NYHA functional class has been improved III to I 18 months after the operation.
