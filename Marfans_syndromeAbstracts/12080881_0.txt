In 1991, a technique to exclude aortic aneurysms from circulation inserting an endoluminal graft through the femoral artery, was described. This procedure, usually used for elective abdominal aneurysms, can also be used in the thoracic aorta. We report a 41 years old male with a Marfan syndrome, presenting with a descending aorta aneurysm that ruptured to the mediastinum and pleural cavity. He was compensated hemodynamically and an endovascular stent-graft was deployed at the ruptured zone, through the femoral artery. The postoperative evolution of the patient was uneventful. This technique will allow a less invasive treatment of ruptured aortic aneurysms.
