 BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to assess early and late outcome in patients undergoing composite valve graft replacement (CVGR) of the aortic root by means of the Bentall procedure, and to identify predictors of early and late death associated with this surgical approach. METHODS: Between August 1975 and July 2002, 162 consecutive patients underwent a Bentall procedure for CVGR. Demographic, treatment and clinical outcome data from these patients were gathered, reviewed, and analyzed. Potential predictors of early and late mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: The study population was predominantly male (n = 132; 81.5%) and middle-aged (mean age 51.3 +/- 15.8 years; range: 10-79 years). The main indications for surgery were annuloaortic ectasia (n = 75; 46.3%), aortic dissection (n = 44; 27.2%) and Marfan syndrome (n = 34; 21%). Reoperation was required in 37 cases (22.8%). The mean follow up was 74 months. Early (in-hospital) mortality was 1.9% (n = 3). The only independent determinant of early mortality was cardiopulmonary bypass time (p = 0.025). Late mortality was 27.7% (n = 44). On multivariate analysis, the only independent risk factors for late mortality were age >60 years (p = 0.044) and left ventricular ejection fraction <50% (p = 0.037). Actuarial survival rates were 92.9%, 77%, 56.2%, and 47.1% at one, five, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Rates of freedom from reoperation on the aortic root and ascending aorta were 90.6% and 72.5% at five and 15 years, respectively. No false aneurysms were observed at any coronary reimplantation sites. CONCLUSION: In this series, the Bentall procedure was associated with low operative mortality and good early and late results. This suggests that the procedure may be considered as a reference to other operations on the aortic root, at least in adult patients.
