We present a case of 23-year-old male with the Marfan syndrome multiple accessory pathways and atrio-ventricular reentry ant tachycardia (AVRT) as well as atrial fibrillation (AF). Sotalol was partially effective for AVRT, however, it did not prevent AF, RF ablation cured all arrythmias. This case shows that sotalol can attenuate AVRT recurrences, however, it does not prevent rapid conduction via accessory pathways during AF.
