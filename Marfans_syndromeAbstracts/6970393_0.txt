The definition and the classification of bullae are recalled and documented by some examples. Two types of bullae are opposed : bulla found in normal parenchyma and bulla associated with widespread emphysematous lesions. The biochemical and biological mechanisms of the emphysematous changes are briefly described, with a distinction of two different pathogenesis : on one hand, an inherited defect in connective tissue synthesis as in Marfan syndrome, and on the other hand, an unbalance between proteases and antiproteases. The pathologist's contribution to the classification of the surgical forms of emphysema is documented by an electron microscopic study of lung biopsy in some cases : two cases with bullae (a Marfan syndrome and an alpha 1 AT deficiency of the Pi Z phenotype) with diffuse panlobular emphysema; and 4 cases of bullae without radiological evidence of emphysema. The elastic fibres were modified only in the 2 first cases but were normal in the others. A follow up of such cases is needed.
