A 3 year old girl was admitted to hospital in an emaciated condition and with polydipsia in October 1974. Following the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, she received treatment with insulin. On the first admission, a systolic murmur was noted at the apex of the heart. In 1981, the murmur was found to be continuous with a systolic click, and echocardiography demonstrated a mitral valve prolapse. In 1982, electrocardiography revealed left ventricular hypertrophy, and the patient's X-ray showed vertebral kyphoscoliosis. Ophthalmological examination revealed slightly impaired visual acuity and a mild case of cataracts in 1986. The patient grew to be tall and thin with arachnodactylia of the hands, fingers, feet and toes. These symptoms and findings were compatible with Marfan syndrome, although the ophthalmological findings are not specific for this disease. This patient is the first case in Japan of Marfan syndrome associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, although the relation between Marfan syndrome and IDDM remains unclear.
