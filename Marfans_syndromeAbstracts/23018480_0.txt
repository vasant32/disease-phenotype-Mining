Pregnancy in a patient with Marfan syndrome may pose significant maternal and fetal risks, and pregnancy outcome is most impacted by the extent of cardiovascular involvement present at conception. This review addresses principles to guide preconception counseling of a Marfan patient, in addition to antepartum and intrapartum management considerations. Multidisciplinary care is recommended during pregnancy, given the potential for multiorgan involvement and various complications which may occur. Mode of delivery planning is guided by the degree of aortic root dilatation. Dissection of a dilated aortic root can present a surgical emergency during pregnancy, and principles for cardiopulmonary bypass in a pregnant patient are reviewed.
