Two degenerations of the mitral valve apparatus, namely myxoid degeneration of the mitral cusps and necrosis with subsequent calcification of the annulus fibrosus, are extensively reviewed and discussed. Both lesions are mainly noticed in elderly patients, with the possible exception of systemic dystrophies of the connective tissue associated with metabolic disorders. The clinicopathological correlations of several cases are reported, with special emphasis on modern diagnostic procedures and their wide anatomic spectrum.
