We have performed aortic root replacement in twin Marfan patients. They were male and aged 33 years at the times of the operations. One had pneumonia but the other had no complaints. Echocardiography showed geometries typical of annuloaortic ectasia (aortic diameters of 6.4 and 6.8 cm) and a moderate degree of aortic insufficiency. Aortic roots were replaced utilizing composite valve graft and the coronary orifices were reimplanted with Carrel's patch technique. The operations were carried out at almost the same time. The patients had a satisfactory postoperative course. Because of the potential for late dissection or aneurysm in other areas of the aorta, they should have regular follow-up examinations by MRI and CT indefinitely.
