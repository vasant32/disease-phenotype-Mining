Aortic aneurysms occurs very rarely in young women. They usually accompany congenital heart diseases, Marfan's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation. What is more, they may be the consequence of syphilis and trauma, however less frequently. Despite their rare incidence, aortic aneurysms seem to be an important problem due to high maternal mortality during gestation. Hemodynamic changes which occur in pregnancy favour the appearance of this pathology, deteriorating the prognosis even further--half of the cases of aortic ruptures in women aged below 40 years are associated with pregnancy. Until recently only a few cases of aneurysm repairs during pregnancy have been reported. Also, only one pregnancy and one delivery in a patient after the repair of aortic aneurysm have been described in the literature. In our research we wish to report the successful management of a pregnancy, ended by vaginal route, 8 years after the replacement of descending thoracic aorta with a synthetic graft for aneurysm.
