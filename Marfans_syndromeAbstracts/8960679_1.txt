Marfan's syndrome is an inherited, degenerative connective tissue disorder that affects many body systems (eg, skeletal, ocular, cardiovascular, cutaneous, pulmonary, abdominal, neurologic). The cause of Marfan's syndrome is unknown, but recent genetic studies have linked this disorder to chromosome 15q15-q21.3. The characteristics associated with Marfan's syndrome require a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. This article discusses one serious complication of Marfan's syndrome-aortic root dilatation- and composite graft repairs of ascending aortic aneurysms. Physicians and nurses must be more aware of Marfan's syndrome so that life-threatening medical conditions can be evaluated and followed by health care providers.
