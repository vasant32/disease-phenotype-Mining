De Paulis and associated introduced a new aortic root conduit for valve-sparing operation. The use of this prosthesis for David I (reimplantation) procedure occasionally may be problematic when the top of the commissures, do not match the new sinotubular junction of the graft. We propose a simple method that allows to create a new sinotubular junction at the desired level in the skirt portion of the Valsalva prosthesis.
