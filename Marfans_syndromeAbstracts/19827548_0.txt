We reviewed aortic root disease and operative procedures. Between January 1982 and December 2008, aortic root operation was performed for 58 patients with various aortic root disease. We chose Bentall type operations in extensive root destructive cases and urgent or reoperative cases. Overall in-hospital mortality was 8.6% (5/58). Four patients (7.5% of survivors) died during the period of followup. Actuarial survival at 15 years was 92%. Freedom from cardiovascular event at 10 and 15 years was 81% and 27%, respectively. Of 5 reoperations in 5 patients, only 1 was required due to complications of the initial Bentall type operation. The Bentall type operations resulted in a durable result. Although, in Marfan syndrome, freedom from cardiovascular event was lower than that in non-Marfan syndrome, actuarial survival rate was equal with non-Marfan syndrome. Close observation is necessary for detecting cardiovascular event, especially in Marfan syndrome.
