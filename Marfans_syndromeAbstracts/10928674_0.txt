A 30-year-old male with Marfan syndrome underwent pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy combined with silicone oil injection for the treatment of retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Four months after vitrectomy, the silicone oil was removed using an anterior chamber maintainer (AC) and a self-sealing clear corneal incision at the upper temporal quadrant. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) developed at the end of the operation. It was limited to the nasal side of the retina. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage remained to be limited and did not show progression.
