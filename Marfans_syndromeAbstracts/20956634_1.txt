 BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) results from mutations in the TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 genes and is known to cause aggressive cardiovascular disease, including aortic aneurysms and dissections at an early age. Currently, craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiovascular findings play an important role in early recognition of the disease. While many patients do have recognizable cutaneous features of LDS, little information about associated skin findings has been reported. OBSERVATIONS: Four unrelated patients with LDS due to a mutation in the TGFBR2 gene were observed to have numerous facial milia. All 4 patients reported that the milia had been present since early childhood and had increased in number with time. In some cases, affected relatives were reported to have similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the association of LDS and facial milia has not been previously reported. Recognition of LDS is important because the aggressive aortic and arterial disease warrants early surgical therapy. Facial milia and other cutaneous findings may possibly differentiate LDS from Marfan syndrome and other related disorders, thereby facilitating early diagnosis. Interestingly, each of the 4 patients with LDS and facial milia had a mutation in TGFBR2 despite widespread variability in other features of the disease.
