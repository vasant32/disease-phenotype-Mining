OBJECTIVES: To review our experience with combined pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy and open-loop flexible anterior chamber intraocular lens (AC IOL) implantation for managing subluxated crystalline lenses. METHODS: Retrospective review of 36 consecutive eyes (28 patients), all of which had subluxated crystalline lenses, managed by pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy with insertion of an open-loop flexible AC IOL. The study was performed at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, over an 8-year period. RESULTS: An average preoperative visual acuity of 20/163 (range, 20/25 to hand motions) improved to 20/36 (range, 20/20 to 4/200) with surgery after a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 1 to 59 months) (P < .001, Student's paired t test). Final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was achieved in 75% of eyes (27/36). Complications included cystoid macular edema (8% [3/36]), pupillary block (6% [2/36]), retinal detachment (3% [1/36]), hyphema (3% [1/36]), wound leak (3% [1/36]), and transient vitreous hemorrhage (3% [1/36]). No persistent ocular hypertension was seen, nor did angle abnormalities or corneal decompensation develop. CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana lensectomy-vitrectomy with AC IOL implantation appears to be an excellent technique for managing subluxated crystalline lenses. It is associated with a significant improvement in visual acuity (P < .001) and avoids many of the complications seen with extraction of a subluxated lens through a limbal wound. Additionally, use of an AC IOL offers a simplified alternative to placement of a ciliary sulcus sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL).
