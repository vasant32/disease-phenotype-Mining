 IMPLICATIONS: We experienced an unexpected tracheomalacia exhibiting CO2 retention and an increased peak inspiratory pressure after beginning an operation; it was confirmed with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. If there are no problems in the circuit or tube when the patient shows CO2 retention and increases in peak inspiratory pressure, the fiberoptic bronchoscope is helpful
