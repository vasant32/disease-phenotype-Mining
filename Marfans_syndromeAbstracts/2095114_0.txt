PURPOSE: To analyse a 10-year experience with the Bentall and De Bono technique for surgical treatment of aneurysms of ascending aorta. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1980 to December 1989, the Bentall and De Bono technique was employed in 38 patients. Twenty-two patients had aneurysm of ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency; 14 had chronic aortic dissections. Four patients were operated on previously by other techniques. RESULTS: The immediate mortality was 5.2%; one patient due to low-output syndrome and one had neurological complications. Five patients (13.1%) died late postoperatively. The surviving 31 patients were followed up from two to 72 months (mean 25). Of these, 29 (93.5%) were in functional class I and two in class II. Sixteen patients had late evaluation by one or more of the following methods: digital angiography, chest computerized tomography, echocardiography, or conventional angiography, 6 to 60 (mean 33) months after operation. All of them had good conditions of composite valve graft and coronary artery reattachment. The immediate and late results were similar in patients with aneurysms and aortic dissections. CONCLUSION: The aortic valve and aortic ascending portion replacement with reimplantation of coronary arteries is of low mortality and fairly good late outcome.
