Tissue microfibrils contain fibrillin-1 as a major constituent. Microfibrils regulate bioavailability of TGFÎ² superfamily growth factors and are structurally crucial in the ocular zonule. FBN1 mutations typically cause the Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting with skeletal overgrowth, aortic aneurysm, and lens dislocation (ectopia lentis). Infrequently, FBN1 mutations cause dominantly inherited Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), isolated ectopia lentis (IEL), or the fibrotic condition, geleophysic dysplasia (GD). Intriguingly, mutations in ADAMTS [a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease (reprolysin-type) with thrombospondin type 1 motif] family members phenocopy these disorders, leading to recessive WMS (ADAMTS10), WMS-like syndrome (ADAMTS17), IEL (ADAMTSL4 and ADAMTS17) and GD (ADAMTSL2). An ADAMTSL2 founder mutation causes Musladin-Lueke syndrome, a fibrotic disorder in beagle dogs. The overlapping disease spectra resulting from fibrillin-1 and ADAMTS mutations, interaction of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2 with fibrillin-1, and evidence that these ADAMTS proteins accelerate microfibril biogenesis, constitutes a consilience suggesting that some ADAMTS proteins evolved to provide a novel mechanism regulating microfibril formation and consequently cell behavior.
