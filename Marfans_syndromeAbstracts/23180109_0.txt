A 39-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome presented to our hospital with chest oppression on effort. She underwent aortic root remodeling combined with aortic valve replacement 14 years ago and Bentall operation for enlargement of remaining native Valsalva sinus 3 years ago. A coronary computed tomography and a coronary angiography showed left main coronary artery stenosis, which was subsequently treated with percutaneous coronary intervention using a bare-metal stent. Follow-up coronary angiography performed 1 year after stenting revealed no restenosis.
