Total aortic replacement including aortic valve was performed successfully in the two patients in whom this method of treatment was utilized to correct a chronic dissecting aortic aneurysm. Both patients had moderately severe aortic insufficiency producing increasing heart strain and progressive enlargement of the false lumen of aortic dissection involving the entire aorta despite ideal blood pressure control. In addition, one patient had Marfan's syndrome. The surgical treatment for both patients was performed in two stages. At the first operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, profound hypothermia, and circulatory arrest were employed while the aortic valve and the ascending and transverse aortic arch were replaced and the coronary and brachiocephalic vessels were reattached to the composite valve-graft used for replacement. At the second operation, the entire descending thoracic and abdominal aortic segments were replaced with a graft and the intercostal, lumbar, and visceral arteries reattached thereto. Left vocal cord paralysis occurred in both patients and transient mild paraparesis occurred in only one. Both patients are alive and well, one at 13 months and one at 6 weeks. This experience suggests an additional treatment modality for selected patients with complications of chronic aortic dissection.
