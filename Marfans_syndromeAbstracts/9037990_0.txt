BACKGROUND: Corneal distortion in contact lens wear can be produced by epithelial wrinkles, compression rings, and anterior corneal surface mosaic. True corneal wrinkling can also occur but is an extremely rare phenomenon. These conditions can be manifested as alterations in keratometry and corneal topography. METHODS: A case report is presented of a 17-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome. Central corneal wrinkling developed in his right eye while he was wearing low-water-content hydrogel contact lenses. No visual discomfort or distortions were noted. RESULTS: The patient was refitted with a non-HEMA hydrogel polymer contact lens, with no further episodes of corneal wrinkling observed during subsequent care of the patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case represents an example of corneal wrinkling in a patient wearing hydrogel contact lenses. It is unlikely this finding is related to Marfan syndrome.
