Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of the connective tissue that affects the cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular systems, and often involves the skin, nervous system and lungs. Historically, a person with Marfan syndrome had a poor prognosis due to the cardiovascular effects of this disorder. The life expectancy has improved dramatically over the past 30 years for individuals with Marfan syndrome because of aggressive medical and molecular research and advances in surgical technology. This article discusses the history, genetics, manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome.
