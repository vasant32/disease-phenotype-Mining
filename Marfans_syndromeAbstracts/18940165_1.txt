Abnormal systemic collagen metabolism is thought to dispose to the development of hernias. Studies have shown that a reduced type-I/III collagen ratio predisposes to the development of hernias. Patient groups with reduced type-I/III collagen ratio and consequently increased risk of herniation include patients with Ehlers-Danlos, Marfans syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, cutis laxa, and patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, colonic diverticula or stress urinary incontinence. Looking ahead, the perspective may be individualization of the operative technique for patients with a hernia, depending on their collagen profile.
