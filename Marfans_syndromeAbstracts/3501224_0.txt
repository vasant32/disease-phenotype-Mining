Lensectomy with the pars plana technique was performed in 16 eyes of 11 patients (2 female, 9 male) with congenital subluxated lenses. Lens subluxation was associated with homocystinuria in 2 patients, Marfan's syndrome in 4, congenital simple ectopia lentis in 2 and without any known heredity in 3 patients. The reason for removal was in all eyes optical disturbances. Five patients were operated on both eyes. All lenses were removed with the Kl√∏ti Vitreous Stripper through the pars plana. No complications occurred. Retinal detachment was present pre-operatively in both eyes in one patient with homocystinuria. In the post-operative period, prophylactic photocoagulation and cryotherapy were performed in 7 eyes in 6 patients (6 photocoagulation and 1 cryo). The pars plana technique for removal of clear subluxated lenses in young individuals seems to be the method of choice. Complications are negligible and the method gives excellent optical results.
