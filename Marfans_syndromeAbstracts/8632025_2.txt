A patient with Marfan syndrome with ascending aortic aneurysm, aortic regurgitation and pectus excavatum was treated with simultaneous Bentall's procedure and sternal turnover. Partial sternal necrosis and mediastinitis developed 12 days after surgery. After debridement of about one-third of turnovered sterno-costal complex (SC), successful salvage of the remaining two-thirds of SC and sterilization of the infected aortic Dacron graft were accomplished with pedicled omental flap. The 7 previously published cases of simultaneous Bentall's procedure and sternal turnover are reviewed.
