The patient was a 51-year-old man with Marfan syndrome who had simultaneously undergone modified Bentall operation (Carrel patch method) and coronary artery bypass grafting. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) occurred 19 months after the operation. PVE had thereafter been treated by antibiotic therapy for 3 months, but echocardiography revealed prosthetic valve detachment and aortic root pseudoaneurysm ruptured into the right ventricle which appeared to have been caused by PVE. At reoperation there were no laboratory or intraoperative findings indicative of ongoing inflammation or infection. The composite graft, therefore, didn't require replacing, and it was possible to simply re-suture the composite graft and directly close the tear. The postoperative course has been uneventful with no further evidence of endocarditis.
