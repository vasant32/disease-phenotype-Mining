The MEN II b syndrome is a form of multiple endocrine neoplasie (MEN). The main features are medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, adenoma of the parathyroid glands and a marfanoid appearance. The authors report a case of MEN II b with a characteristic combination of ocular findings: thickened upper eyelids, ectopia puncti lacrimalis, decreased secretion of the lacrimal gland, medullary corneal nerves and a ring of neuromatous tissue at the limbus corneae. The differential diagnosis and the possibility of early diagnosis and management of this endocrine neoplasia are discussed in detail.
