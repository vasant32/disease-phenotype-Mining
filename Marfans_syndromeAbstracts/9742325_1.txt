There is no single standardized method of repair for the anatomic variations in aortic root pathology, which may include dissection, aneurysmal dilation, and valve disease and can occur at the annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, or the sinotubular junction. Composite valve/graft replacement, valve resuspension, and allograft each play a significant role in aortic root therapy, but none is applicable in all cases. Patient age, Marfan's syndrome, endocarditis, and previous valve replacement are examples of some of the wide variations in delineating factors.
