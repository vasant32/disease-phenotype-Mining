Precise diagnosis of aortic composite graft dehiscence may be difficult. We present a case illustrating this problem and its resolution. Two-dimensional echocardiography and contrast ventriculography revealed a space adjacent to the aortic valve conduit that demonstrated marked systolic expansion. The dynamic variation of this space was secondary to communication with the left ventricular cavity caused by disruption of the composite graft valve ring. Thus, systolic expansion of the aortic root is a useful echocardiographic and angiographic sign of composite graft dehiscence.
