 BACKGROUND: Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a rare and severe phenotype of this disease. A poor prognosis is anticipated due to the high probability of congestive heart failure, and mitral and tricuspid regurgitations with suboptimal response to medical therapy and difficulties in surgical management at an early age. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two consecutive patients with this disease who are the first reported cases from Iran to the best of our knowledge. Unfortunately both of them died shortly after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Neonatal Marfan syndrome is reported from Iran and has a poor prognosis like the patients reported from elsewhere.
