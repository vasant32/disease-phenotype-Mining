In diseases of major arteries there is an increased turnover of connective tissue components. This implies a greater excretion of fragments of collagen and elastin. The changes for each of these may be useful in further delineating the nature of the disease. In a preliminary study, the urine of 10 Marfan's syndrome patients was analyzed. The hydroxyproline (collagen) concentration was up to eight times higher than that of control subjects. The desmosine (elastin) crosslink concentration was either normal or slightly reduced in these patients. The mean of the ratio of hydroxyproline to desmosine was nearly seven times higher in the patients.
