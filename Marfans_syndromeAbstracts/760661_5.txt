There is increasing evidence that, as in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), deposition of immune complexes plays a role in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Dermatitis herpetiformis and SLE were diagnosed in a 15-year-old girl with Marfan's syndrome who died of cardiac tamponade secondary to cystic medial necrosis of the ascending aorta. The concurrence of these diseases suggests that predisposition to immune-mediated disorders may be associated with the expression of multiple clinical entities.
