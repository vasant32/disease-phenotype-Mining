A three-staged operation for multifocal aortic aneurysms was conducted over a period of 8 months in a 52-year-old woman with the Marfan syndrome. The aortic valve and ascending aorta, the abdominal aorta and the upper half of the descending thoracic aorta were replaced. As of 9 months after the third operation, the patient's course has been uneventful, but continuous follow-up will be needed in view of the character of this disease.
