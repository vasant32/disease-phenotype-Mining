In patients with diseases of the aorta, a guideline-oriented classification of severity should first be obtained, with consideration being given to clinical symptoms and the outcomes of technical examinations. In the case of asymptomatic patients with a low-grade aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency, physical exercise even of a more than mild nature, can be permitted. For patients with moderate and higher-grade aortic valve problems, limitation of physical activity is recommended on an individual basis. With regard to the level of effort permissible, the extent of both static and dynamic effort should be taken into account. In the case of a bicuspid aortic valve, limitations should be placed on physical effort when dilation of the aortic root is also present. Patients with Marfan syndrome in whom remodelling of the aortic valve and/or aortic root has taken place should not be permitted to participate in any form of sporting activity.
