Despite the increase in car accidents, aortic valve injury from blunt trauma remains rare. In one case, a 30-year-old Marfan male, who was under observation at our outpatient clinic, suffered from aortic regurgitation due to a tear in the left coronary cusp of a previously echocardiographically normal valve. Acute ventricular failure demanded surgical management within 3 days after an automobile accident. The case was successfully treated by replacement of the aortic valve with a no. 23 Sorin Bicarbon prosthesis. The patient fully recovered and experienced an uneventful 6 months of follow-up.
