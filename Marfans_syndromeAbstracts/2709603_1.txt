Aortic aneurysm occurs rarely in childhood. Most aneurysms in children are associated with conditions such as Marfan's syndrome, coarctation of the aorta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and neurofibromatosis. We report a case of descending thoracic-abdominal aortic aneurysm in an eighteen month old boy with a mask-like face, ocular hypertelorism, blepharoptosis, a high arched palate and low set ears. He was scheduled for a bypass graft of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta under partial cardiopulmonary bypass. High dose morphine anesthesia (2mg/kg) was employed and halothane was used to control the blood pressure. To our knowledge, anesthetic management of such an infant had not been reported. Therefore, we anesthetized this child according to anesthetic managements for adult cases considering carefully the boy's multiple anomalies. Anesthetic managements for the surgery of aortic aneurysms in childhood are discussed.
