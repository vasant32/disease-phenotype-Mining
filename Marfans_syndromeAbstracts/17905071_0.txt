 BACKGROUND: Anterior sacral meningocele is a rare congenital malformation, whose open surgical treatment is well accepted. We present a laparoscopic approach as an adjunctive approach. METHODS: Five women who underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal surgery were clinically, radiologically, and surgically evaluated. RESULT: All 5 patients underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal surgery and showed satisfactory results. They had no major complications. Three patients had headaches as minor complications, but it was gone in at most 3 days. Decrease in operative time, blood loss, and length of hospitalization were the advantages of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic approach to treating anterior sacral meningocele was feasible and safe, with only minor complications.
