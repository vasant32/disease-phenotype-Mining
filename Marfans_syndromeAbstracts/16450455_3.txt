 PURPOSE: To assess implantation of an Artisan aphakic intraocular lens (IOL) in cases with subluxated lenses due to Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Retrospective study of a small case series comprised of seven eyes (two children and three adults) with subluxated lenses due to Marfan syndrome that underwent lens extraction and Artisan aphakic IOL implantation. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity and endothelial cell status were the key elements of follow-up examinations. RESULTS: No complications occurred during surgery. Visual acuity was improved by > or = 4 Snellen lines in all seven eyes. These results were maintained at the last follow-up. Endothelial cell status remained constant in all cases at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In seven eyes with a subluxated crystalline lens due to Marfan syndrome, implantation of an Artisan aphakic IOL improved visual acuity while preserving anterior chamber status.
