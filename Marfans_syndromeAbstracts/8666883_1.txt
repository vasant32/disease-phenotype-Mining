A 43-year-old female was hospitalized on October 25, 1993, due to severe back pain. She was diagnosed with annulo aortic ectasis, Stanford type-A acute aortic dissection and pectus excavatum caused by Marfan's syndrome. On November 30, 1993, single-stage surgery was performed, including modified Bentall procedure, aortic arch replacement, elephant trunk method and sternoplasty. Concerning the procedure for pectus excavatum, sternoplasty was selected because we thought that sternoplasty could endure the long procedure which would cause infection compared with sternal turnover. Postoperative course was satisfactory, and she is well 18 months after surgery.
