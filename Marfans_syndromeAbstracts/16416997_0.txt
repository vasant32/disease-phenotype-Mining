 PURPOSE: To review the visual outcome of planned pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation for ectopia lentis in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1997-2002, 116 eyes were operated because of lens subluxation, mainly because of decreased visual acuity (<0.4). Lens subluxation was associated with homocystinuria in 4 patients (8 eyes), Marfan's syndrome in 30 (54 eyes), congenital simple ectopia lentis in 16 (31 eyes), post trauma in 6 (6 eyes), and congenital ectopia lentis and pupillae in 9 (17 eyes). Time of observation ranged between 1 to 6 years (mean 3.4). RESULTS: After surgery, we achieved best-corrected visual acuity improvement in 89%. Unsatisfactory visual results were due to amblyopia (9 eyes), complications of retinal detachement surgery (3 eyes), uveitis (2 eyes), glaucoma (1 eye). CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana lensectomy, vitrectomy and scleral-fixated IOL implantation give quick and good functional results. To achieve these results, visual rehabilitation and amblyopia treatment is necessary.
