We report a case of scaphotrapezial arthritis that developed in a patient with Marfan's syndrome many years after a carpometacarpal fusion, which placed the thumb metacarpal in adduction. This problem was effectively treated with an abduction/opposition osteotomy, which both increased the patient's first web space and improved her arthritic symptoms.
