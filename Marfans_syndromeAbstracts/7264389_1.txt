The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of two-dimensional echocardiography with that of other methods in the detection and localization of aneurysm involving the ascending aorta in patients with annuloaortic ectasia. Two-dimensional echocardiography, RI angiography, CT scan and aortography were performed in 19 patients (12 patients with Marfan's syndrome, 4 with aortitis syndrome and 3 with postoperative perivalvular aneurysm). Eight of 12 patients with Marfan's syndrome had dissection in the ascending aorta which was confirmed at surgery or autopsy. The following observations were obtained. 1) Dissection of the ascending aorta was clearly demonstrated on the two-dimensional echocardiogram in 7 patients by recording the intimal tear and flap, and in these cases the short axis two-dimensional echocardiogram of the ascending aorta was more useful in identifying the site and extent of dissection. 2) In patients with postoperative perivalvular aneurysms, RI angiography proved to be a more useful and sensitive technique in differentiating a leakage into the aneurysm from clots in the aneurysm. 3) CT scanning proved to be an insensitive technique to detect dissection of the ascending aneurysm and to differentiate a leakage from clots in the perivalvular aneurysm. From these observations, we concluded that two-dimensional echocardiography and RI angiography proved to be sensitive techniques in detecting dissection of the ascending aneurysm and evaluating a postoperative aneurysm in patients with annuloaortic ectasia.
