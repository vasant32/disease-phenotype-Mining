Eight patients with ectasia of the aortic annulus due to cystic degeneration of the media are presented. All patients were operated with a technique similar to the one described by Bentall and De Bono. Six patients had the aortic valve replaced by a bioprosthesis and two patients with a St. Jude Medical Valve Prosthesis. Manoeuvers to avoid anastomotic tension, adequate myocardial protection, and a careful control of postbypass blood pressure are described. There was no early or late mortality. Patients have been followed for a mean period of twelve months. Seven patients are in grade I of the N.Y.H.A., and one in grade II. Five patients studied postoperatively with cardiac catheterization and angiography showed normal ventricular function, normal prosthetic function and no aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm in any of the suture lines and with a good coronary anatomy.
