Marfan syndrome (MS) is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by arachnodactyly, tall stature, the presence of aortic aneurysm, and lens dislocation. Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a chronic vasculitis that primarily affects the aorta and its branches. The authors report the first case of TA in a patient with MS. The simultaneous presence of TA and MS could be a coincidence, however; the pathogenesis of TA might be linked with autoimmunity induced by abnormal extracellular matrix protein derived from the genetic mutations in MS.
