In a 48-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent composite graft replacement of the ascending aorta and the aortic valve with reimplantation of the coronary arteries a cardiac enlargement was detected by routine chest x-ray. Transthoracal echocardiography showed a pseudoaneurysm around the composite graft. The examination with a multiplane transesophageal echocardiographic probe demonstrated a systolic-diastolic jet into the pseudoaneurysm with the site of origin at the ostium of the right coronary artery.
