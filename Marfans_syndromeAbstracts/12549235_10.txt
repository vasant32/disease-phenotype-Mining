The biophysical properties of the aortic wall seems to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, aneurysm formation, Marfan's syndrome, and in normal aging. The presence and the proportion of smooth muscle, collagen, and elastin proteins contribute to the compliance of the vessel wall with the latter being the most extensible component. However, elastin fibers fracture at low stresses contributing to a decrease of the aortic compliance and consequently to an elevation of the pulse pressure, which is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Early detection of a decrease in the aortic compliance could help to identify early cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic patients and monitor the results of the therapeutic interventions. Therefore, estimation of the aortic compliance can be used for both screening as well as long-term follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging which is a noninvasive, accurate, and reproducible method can estimate the compliance of the aortic wall either by measuring the relative change in cross sectional area of a chosen segment using ECG-triggered spin echo or gradient echo sequences or by measuring the pulse wave velocity through the aorta using the phase contrast-magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) technique. Both techniques have been validated and many sudies suggest MRI as a valuable tool for evaluating aortic wall function. However, large prospective studies are mandatory for the method to be established as a screening tool.
