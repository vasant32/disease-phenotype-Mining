We report on an 18-year-old man who had both acute monoblastic leukemia and Marfan syndrome. A diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was established by those characteristics of arachnodactyly, ectopia lentis, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral regurgitation. Findings on bone marrow examination of the patient showed that most of nucleated cells were monoblasts and immunophenotype of those cells showed CD13+, CD33+, CD56+, and HLA-DR+. To our knowledge, this is the second report of leukemia in Marfan syndrome in the world.
