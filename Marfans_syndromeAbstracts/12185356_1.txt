Giant retinal tear is seen in association with Stickler's syndrome, Marfan syndrome, homocystinurea and after ocular trauma. Although bacterial meningitis(1) is not common since the advent of various antibiotics, meningococcus is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis. Endogenous endophthalmitis(2) remains a challenge to clinicians despite the success of antibiotics in reducing its frequency and severity. The association of giant retinal tear and meningococcal endogenous endophthalmitis is not yet reported in the literature. We report here on a 14-year-old girl who developed a giant retinal tear after meningococcal meningitis and endogenous endophthalmitis, and we discuss the possible factors of its cause.
