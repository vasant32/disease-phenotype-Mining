Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a commonly diagnosed condition with varied clinical presentations but local data is lacking. In our study, we reviewed 98 patients (54 males, 44 females) with echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse diagnosed between 1991 and 1993 to study the clinical profile and echocardiographic features of patients with this condition in our local population. The mean and median age at presentation/detection were 42 years and 38 years respectively. The majority of the patients were asymptomatic (59%); the rest presented with palpitations (21%), congestive heart failure (4%) and infective endocarditis (5%). On clinical examination, 64 patients had mitral regurgitation (13 patients had both mitral regurgitation murmur and a systolic click), while one or more systolic clicks were heard in another 32 patients. Six patients also had associated Marfan syndrome. 2D echo revealed isolated anterior and posterior leaflet involvement in 55 and 19 patients respectively. Another 24 patients had involvement of both leaflets. Mitral regurgitation was detected on colour Doppler study in 78 patients. Nine patients had associated tricuspid valve prolapse. Of the 98 patients, 8 patients developed flail mitral valve. Four were detected at presentation/diagnosis, while the other 4 were diagnosed incidentally on routine follow-up 2D echo. Of these 8 patients, one developed cardiac failure. The patients had been on follow-up for a mean period of 9 months. During this period, mitral regurgitation progressed in 3 patients resulting in valve surgery. Only 20 patients had arrhythmias detected on ambulatory ECG monitoring, most of them were frequent atrial and ventricular premature beats. No patient was found to have haemodynamically significant arrhythmia. In summary, most patients with MVP had anterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse and mitral regurgitation. Although most patients with MVP are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms, it is associated with significant morbidity.
