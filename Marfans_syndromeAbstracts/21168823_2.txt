 PURPOSE: To describe a novel method for placement of a sulcus-fixated, sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens (sf-SPC-IOL) using endoscopic guidance during pars plana vitrectomy surgery. DESIGN: A retrospective case-series by a single surgeon in both pediatric and adult patients undergoing sf-SPC-IOL in the setting of posterior segment surgery. METHODS: Seventy-four eyes of 71 patients had pars plana vitrectomy and placement of an sf-SPC-IOL in an academic, outpatient setting. Preoperative diagnosis included trauma (42%), subluxated lenses with no capsular support (24%), uveitis (15%), congenital cataract (11%), Marfan syndrome or ectopia lentis (6%), and other (2%). Fifty-one adults and 20 children (<18 years of age) were reviewed from cases performed from 1999 through 2007. The sf-SPC-IOL sutures were placed using endoscopic visualization of ab interno scleral fixation. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was nearly 3 years (3 months to 9 years) and most patients experienced an improvement in visual function. Many eyes had advanced posterior segment disorders. Only 2 broken sutures occurred, both attributable to repeat trauma. Advantages of this technique include: excellent visualization and haptic localization, optimal lens centration, buried knots, broad scleral imbrication, and minimal vitreous- and hemorrhage-related complications. Disadvantages include the learning curve, increased operative time, long-term suture stability issues, and limited availability of intraocular endoscopes. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic-guided sf-SPC-IOL using this approach, in the setting of posterior segment disease, is a reasonable option for visual rehabilitation in both pediatric and adult patients.
