A 23-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome was admitted for repair of annulo-aortic ectasia and severe pectus excavatum. A submammary skin incision approach followed by bilateral subperichondrial resection of abnormal costal cartilages was performed. The left intercostal muscles and perichondrial sheaths were divided 2 inches lateral to the sternum in a parasternal fashion to place the retractor. The aortic root was replaced with a 23-mm St. Jude's composite graft (St. Jude Medical, Inc, St. Paul, MN). Chest wall reconstruction was completed with a high sternal osteotomy and support of the sternum was made with Gortex strips (W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, AZ). The patient made an uneventful recovery.
