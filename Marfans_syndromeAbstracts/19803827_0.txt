Patients with congenital heart disease who wish to become pregnant offer a challenge to obstetricians, cardiologists and anesthetists. Although no large randomized trials exist to support the management of this emerging population, small prospective and retrospective studies provide valuable data on the likely success of pregnancy and the risks involved. Recently, there is emerging consensus on the management of this specialized group of patients, and this article aims to provide the practitioner with an overview of patient needs and the issues to be addressed. All patients with congenital heart disease wishing to consider pregnancy should be referred for specialist assessment prior to conception. Maternal risk, fetal risk and recurrence risk in the fetus should all be addressed. Most women with congenital heart disease can undergo pregnancy without significant risk. However, for some women the risk of maternal death is high, including those with: severe aortic stenosis, impaired left ventricular function, pulmonary hypertension and Marfan syndrome with dilated aortic root. All patients should be offered a detailed 20-week fetal cardiac scan and, in certain cases, prepregnancy genetic counseling. Most patients can deliver vaginally, with cesarean section reserved for obstetric indications or patients in whom straining at delivery could be potentially fatal (i.e., those with Marfan syndrome, aortic aneurysm, severe fixed left heart obstruction, or the acutely unwell mother). Antibiotic prophylaxis should be given routinely in labor to all patients in whom dental prophylaxis is indicated.
