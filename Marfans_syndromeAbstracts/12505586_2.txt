In 1896, French pediatrician Marfan described a 6-year-old patient with a variety of abnormal musculoskeletal features, including arachnodactyly and long limbs. Since his original description, reports of young children with Marfan syndrome remain sporadic.  The age-related nature of many of the clinical features of the syndrome often hinder diagnosis,  such that most studies focusing on Marfan syndrome in the pediatric population involve older children.  The few small series that do exist note a less than favorable outcome for young children, with a high rate of surgical intervention  and death.  We sought to compare clinical features and outcomes of patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at &#x2264;6 or >6 years of age.
