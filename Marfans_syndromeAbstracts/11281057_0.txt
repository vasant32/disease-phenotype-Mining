OBJECTIVES: The incidence and severity of coronary artery disease were studied in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD), and compared with coronary artery disease in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO). METHODS: A total of 71 patients(42 males, 29 females, mean age 61.4 +/- 10.0 years) with AAD, undergoing coronary angiography between 1988 and 1999, were studied including 38 patients with open communication type and 33 patients with thrombosed type. According to the Stanford classification, 18 patients were type A and 53 patients were type B. Patients with AAD following Marfan syndrome or chest trauma were excluded from the study. Selective coronary angiography was performed in age- and sex-matched patients with AAA(n = 57; 42 males, 15 females, mean age 63.9 +/- 4.6 years) or ASO (n = 95; 66 males, 29 females, mean age 62.4 +/- 9.4 years). Coronary artery disease was defined as > or = 75% stenosis (left main trunk lesion of > or = 50% stenosis) by multidirectional imaging. RESULTS: Significant coronary artery disease was demonstrated in 14 patients with AAD (19.7%), 25 patients with AAA (43.9%), and 49 patients with ASO (51.5%). The incidence of coronary artery disease was significantly lower in the AAD group than in the other two groups (p < 0.05). One-vessel disease was present in approximately 70% of the patients with AAD and coronary artery disease. In contrast, multivessel disease was observed in approximately 50% of patients with AAA and ASO. Classification of the patients with AAD according to the blood flow in the false lumen showed coronary artery disease was more highly associated with the thrombosed type [10 (30.3%) of 33 patients] than the open communication type [4 (10.5%) of 38 patients]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the patients with AAD showed coronary artery disease was associated with a high serum total cholesterol level (p = 0.025) and the thrombosed type (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of coronary artery disease was significantly lower among patients with AAD than among age- and sex-matched patients with AAA or ASO. Coronary artery disease developed in 30% of the patients with the thrombosed type of AAD, although the prognosis seemed to be good.
