A 34-year-old man with Marfan syndrome finished to replace the total aorta in consecutive 4 operations for 7 years. Two years later, he was diagnosed as bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms and performed a reconstruction of both arteries in September 7, 1998. Then 2 years later, innominate artery was dilated and Y-type grafting was performed in March 14, 2001. Now we have a scheduled operation for celiac artery aneurysm. In patients with Marfan syndrome, aortic dissection and aneurysms are common complications, but progressive dilatations of aortic branches are rear. Regular follow-up is important even though total aortic replacement was completed.
