Coronary ostial aneurysms after composite graft replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve is a rare complication. We report two patients with Marfan syndrome who developed coronary ostial aneurysms at the sites of the coronary anastomosis, presumably because of oversized windows made in the graft. They were successfully treated by redo composite graft replacement. To prevent this complication, it is important to consider that the hole made in the tube graft should not be larger than the diameter of the respective coronary ostium to avoid exposure of the diseased aortic wall to the circulating blood as much as possible, and that the suture used to anastomose the coronary buttons should pass through the rim of the ostium rather than through the aortic wall surrounding it.
