Recently, extended operation has been recommended for aortic dissection associated with Marfan syndrome. However, the operation for acute type A aortic dissection associated with Marfan syndrome is controversial. Between May 1985 and July 1994, 5 patients associated with acute type A aortic dissection and Marfan syndrome underwent surgical repair. CT examination on all patients, the survivors of the initial operation, revealed a gradually enlarged residual pseudolumen. 2 patients who underwent aortic root reconstruction and ascending aortic replacement for the initial operation eventually had to undergo aortic arch repair. From the results of this study and the improvements of intraoperative cerebral protection, we recommend aortic arch repair with aortic root reconstruction and ascending aortic replacement on initial emergency operation for acute type A aortic dissection associated with Marfan syndrome.
