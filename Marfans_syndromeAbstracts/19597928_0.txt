We present a case of left subclavian artery aneurysm in a 48-year-old man with Marfan syndrome. Aneurysmectomy and interposition with an artificial graft were successfully performed through an infraclavicular incision by dividing the clavicle at its midshaft. The clavicle bone was reconstructed with a steel plate, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Because the arterial wall is fragile in cases of connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, our surgical approach was considered to be helpful for gentle maneuvering in an adequate operative field.
