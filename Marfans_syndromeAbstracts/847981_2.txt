Echocardiographic studies of 11 patients with Marfan's syndrome showed that in all adult patients aortic root diameters were larger than 35 mm (normal range 24 to 35, mean 30+/-2 mm). Prolapse of the mitral valve was present in seven of 11 patients. There was no relationship between the degree of aortic root enlargement and the presence of prolapse. However, in five of seven patients with prolapse there were premature ventricular contractions recorded during the echocardiogram or on a separate electrocardiogram. In four patients without prolapse, no premature atrial or ventricular contractions were seen.
