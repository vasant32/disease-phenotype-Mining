A case of Marfan's syndrome associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is described and a discussion follows on the possible relationship of the two conditions. Isolated cases of such an association have been previously reported. It is possible that the association is more common than was previously recognized and the two conditions may share a common pathological basis. Moreover, WPW syndrome may contribute to the cardiac morbidity of Marfan's syndrome.
