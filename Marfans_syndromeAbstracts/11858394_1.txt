BACKGROUND: This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations and surgical outcomes of subluxated lens. METHODS: Reviewing charts from January 1991 to June 2000, we studied 110 patients (123 eyes) who had lens subluxation at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung. For 21 eyes, patients accepted conservative treatment, and 102 eyes underwent surgery (8 eyes had Marfan syndrome; 18 eyes had idiopathic dislocation; and 76 eyes had experienced trauma). Indications of surgery included reduction in visual acuity, uncorrectable refractive error, and secondary glaucoma. RESULTS: There were 81 male and 29 female patients. Their mean age was 47.6 years (range, 2-76 years). The mean post-operative follow-up period was 22.24 months (range, 2-118 months). In spite of the different lens statuses, similar visual results were found between the surgical treatment group and the nonsurgery group. In the surgery group, 47 eyes (46.1%) achieved best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or better. A total of 80 eyes (78.4%) achieved an improvement (log MAR change >0.3) in BCVA. The major postoperative complications included glaucoma (11 eyes), retinal detachment (9 eyes) and intraocular lens dislocation into the vitreous cavity (3 eyes). CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the presence of a subluxated lens alone is not an absolute indication for surgical removal. The lens status had no significant influence on surgical outcome. Most cases can achieve an improvement in BCVA after appropriate management.
