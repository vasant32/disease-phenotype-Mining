Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance. Cerebrovascular disorders associated with Marfan syndrome are known to be rare. In this report, we described a rare case of a 64-year-old woman with an extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm associated with Marfan syndrome. The extracranial ICA was very tortuous and a 3-cm-diameter aneurysm was observed at the distal portion of the carotid bifurcation. Through anterior neck incision, the aneurysm was dissected from the surrounding tissue. The carotid artery was clamped, and external shunting was performed using a 3-way shunt tube. The aneurysm was excised, and an end-to-end anastomosis of the ICA was made. Postoperative course was uneventful except for mild swallowing disturbance lasting for 2 weeks. The surgical indication and technique are discussed.
