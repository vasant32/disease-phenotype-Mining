Pseudoaneurysms and patch aneurysms are life-threatening late complications after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. We treated four patients who presented with a pseudoaneurysm or patch aneurysm involving the descending thoracic portion of a previously implanted TAAA graft. In each patient, stent grafts were placed within the existing graft to cover the aneurysm endoluminally. All patients recovered without major complications, and computed tomography performed after a mean follow-up of 51.5 Â± 19.7 months showed that the repairs remained intact.
