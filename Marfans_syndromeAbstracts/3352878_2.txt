Intracranial aneurysms arising in the region of the cavernous carotid artery are difficult to manage surgically because of the surrounding cavernous sinus. With recent advances in microballoon technology and permanent solidification agents, it is now possible to treat certain intracranial aneurysms by detachable balloons and preserve the parent vessel. A patient with Marfan's syndrome presented with severe retroorbital pain, ophthalmoplegia, and headaches. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a large cavernous carotid artery aneurysm measuring 17 X 9 X 6 mm. This was successfully treated by placing three detachable balloons within the aneurysm and preserving the carotid artery via a transvascular approach. Intravascular detachable balloon embolization may offer a form of alternative therapy for the management of surgically difficult aneurysms.
