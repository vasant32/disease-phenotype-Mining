Two successful cases underwent simultaneous repair for funnel chest using sternal turnover with rectus abdominal flap and intracardiac lesions were reported. A 7-year-old female (case 1) was diagnosed with funnel chest and annulo-aortic ectasia due to Marfan's syndrome. Second patient was a 12-year-old male (case 2) with funnel chest and ventricular septal defect (VSD). Both patients underwent sternal turnover and intracardiac repair (case 1: Bentall's operation, case 2: patch closure of VSD), simultaneously. Removing the cost-sterno complex before cardiac operation allowed an excellent surgical exposure. Bleeding was minimum, especially no homologous blood transfusion was needed in case 2. Simultaneous surgery consisted of intracardiac repair and sternal turnover is recommended even for pediatric patients.
