 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of the TRAFIX instrumentation in correcting scoliosis. METHODS: Since October 1997, 47 patients with scoliosis received spinal fixation with the TRAFIX instrumentation at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The average age was 14. 3 years (range 10 to 38 years). There were 27 idiopathic cases, 16 congenital cases, 2 cases with Marfan syndrome and 2 with neurofibromatosis. Twelve of the 47 patients underwent anterior release, while 4 patients received the revision approach. The average follow-up time was 26 months (13 -38 months). RESULTS: The measurements of primary coronal deformity before and after surgery were 74 degrees (50 degrees approximately 115 degrees) and 38.7 degrees (11 approximately 95 degrees), respectively. The average curve correction was 54%. The average number of fused segments was 12.5 (7 approximately 17) vertebrae. The distance between the center of apex and the C7 plumb line was 56.8 mm before surgery (25 approximately 107 mm) and 31 mm after surgery (10 approximately 87 mm). CONCLUSION: The TRAFIX instrumentation provides three-dimensional correction with refinement, convenience and reliable fixation.
