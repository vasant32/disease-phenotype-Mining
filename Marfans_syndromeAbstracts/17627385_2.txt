Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene FBN1. Mutation detection of this 65-exon gene presents a particular challenge for the diagnostic service in cost, time constraints, and the need to maintain a stringently optimized assay procedure. Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC), we have designed a procedure for rapid mutation scanning, redesigning 50% of published primer sets, screening by Ensembl to avoid inclusion of polymorphic variations and employing a limited set of PCR conditions to allow for a high-throughput 96-well format. We have screened 262 unrelated patients with MFS or Marfan-like phenotypes and detected 103 (39.3%) mutations including 93 different mutations, 72 of which are novel. The mutations include 55 missense (53.4%) 19 splice site (18.5%), 17 frameshift (16.5%), 11 nonsense (10.7%) and 1 in-frame deletion/insertion.
