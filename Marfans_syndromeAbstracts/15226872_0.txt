From July 1980 to February 1984, 26 patients underwent composite replacement of ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic valve with coronary reimplantation. This group included 14 patients with dissecting aneurysm (ten and four respectively, belonging to Types I and II), and 12 patients with chronic aneurysm (six atherosclerotic aneurysms, two Marfan's syndrome and four annuloaortic ectasia cases). Hospital mortality was 35.7% (5/14) in the dissection subgroups and 16.6% (2/12) in the chronic aneurysm subgroup (difference NS). No operative risk factor was recognized. The 19 survivors have been followed up for a total of 393 patient-months (range 5 to 49 months). Controls included echocardiography and computed tomography scanning. Two patients died because of rupture of a persistently dissected aorta; another patient died of an unknown cause. Total actuarial survival rate at 4 years was 58.3 +/- 10.4% (83.3 +/- 10.7% for chronic aneurysms and 42.3 +/- 13.4% for dissecting aneurysms). Among late survivors, there were no paravalvular leaks, new dissections, or thromboembolisms, although two perigraft hematomas and a persistent dissection were later disclosed. When appropriate, composite conduit replacement of the ascending aorta can increase the survival rate, and can also be useful in high-risk patients.
