Preimplantation genetic diagnosis was performed in 61 day 3 embryos obtained by in-vitro fertilization from seven patient carriers of haemophilia, Marfan's syndrome, Bloch-Sulzemberg syndrome (incontinentia pigmentosa) or X chromosome-linked immune deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, and FG syndrome, which is characterized by mental retardation and hypotonia. After multiplex polymerase chain reaction, 16 embryos were diagnosed as being unaffected, and these were transferred to the uterus on the following day (day 4). Of these embryos, six (37.5%) implanted, resulting in the delivery of a singleton and a twin pregnancy, a late second trimester miscarriage (twins at week 20) and a first trimester miscarriage at week 8. All the diagnoses were confirmed by amniocentesis. We report for the first time a late day 4 transfer of biopsied human embryos undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis. This transfer schedule allows an extra day to perform genetic analyses on single blastomeres and to monitor any adverse effect of the biopsy procedure.
