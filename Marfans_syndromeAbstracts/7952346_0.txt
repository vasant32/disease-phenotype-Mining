In cases of an ectopic lens (e.g. Marfan Syndrome) with elongated zonular fibers, the lens can be partially emulsified. This can be done in such a way that it leaves behind a diaphragm consisting of zonular fibers and posterior capsule which is strong enough to support a posterior chamber lens. In cases of traumatically subluxated lenses intercapsular phacoemulsification can be done. The zonular dialysis can be fixed by suturing the capsule directly into the sulcus. The PCL can then be implanted either into the capsular bag or into the sulcus. Suture fixation of a posterior capsule is also possible as a reconstructive measure in previously extracapsular operated eyes.
