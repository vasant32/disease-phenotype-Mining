In open vascular repair, when prolonged infrarenal aortic clamping can be expected, and collateral perfusion is reduced, the use of a temporary shunt may reduce the risk of ischemic complications. In a patient with Marfan's syndrome and aortic dissection who had developed infrarenal aneurysms, segmental arteries had been occluded by prior aortic surgery and collateral arteries in the anterior torso could have been damaged by previous pectus excavatum, muscle flap, sternotomy, and ventral hernia operations. The axillary artery was dilated. For the prevention of ischemia during open repair with a bifurcated graft, a temporary extracorporeal brachio-femoral vascular prosthesis shunt was constructed. Ischemia was not observed. The use of a temporary extracorporeal brachio-femoral shunt with a vascular prosthesis is a feasible method for ischemia prevention.
