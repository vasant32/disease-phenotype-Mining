PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of pars plana vitreolensectomy in the management of subluxed lenses associated with Marfan's syndrome and to assess the need for intraoperative retinal photocoagulation to prevent post-operative retinal detachment. METHOD: A retrospective review was carried out of 40 eyes of patients with Marfan's syndrome who underwent pars plana vitreolensectomy for subluxed lenses. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated stable or improved visual acuity following surgery with a low incidence of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitreolensectomy is a safe and effective treatment for subluxed lenses in patients with Marfan's syndrome. It appears that intraoperative prophylactic laser treatment need only be applied to areas of lattice degeneration to limit the incidence of post-operative retinal detachment.
