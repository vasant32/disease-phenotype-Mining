We performed simultaneous operation of sternal turnover and Cabrol operation for a 28-year-old man, who had 3rd grade funnel chest and annuloaortic ectasia with 3rd grade aortic regurgitation. We think when both annuloaortic ectasia and funnel chest are indicated for operation, simultaneous operation is to be considered and the combination of Cabrol operation and sternal turnover with rectus abdominal flap is the best procedure.
