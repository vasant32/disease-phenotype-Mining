The purpose of this study was to determine how the craniofacial morphology, evaluated from dental casts and lateral cephalograms, in individuals affected by the Marfan syndrome diverge from healthy control groups. The high and narrow palatal vault as well as maxillary and mandibular retrognathy were strongly correlated to the syndrome. About 70% of the Marfan syndrome patients (n = 76) had been referred for orthodontic treatment, mostly because of crowded teeth or extreme maxillary overjet. In 36%, the orthodontic treatment was carried out before diagnosis or suspicion about the Marfan syndrome. In comparison to healthy orthodontic patients (n = 86), selected because of presence of high and narrow palatal vaults, crowding of teeth, extreme maxillary overjet, and open bite were much more prevalent in the Marfan syndrome patients than in the orthodontic control group.
