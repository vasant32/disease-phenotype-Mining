The case report on a 33 year old woman with prominent features of Marfan's syndrome is presented. Characteristic signs were seen in the bones, the eyes, the cardiovascular system, and the lungs. Due to regurgitation of both the aortic and mitral valves and an aneurysm of the ascending aorta a double valve replacement was made, including a prosthesis of the aorta. The problems of early diagnosis and therapy of the life-threatening cardiovascular complications are discussed. Tissue specimens from the aorta were analysed histochemically and biochemically. Histology showed a typical necrosis of the media with cyst formation. Biochemical analysis by in vitro labeling of collagen in tissue explants and by electron microscopical evaluation showed proportions of type I and type III collagen which were significantly different from controls. In both the media and the adventitia the amount of type I collagen was drastically reduced as shown by quantitation of collagen and procollagen. Fibroblasts derived from the skin of the patient showed a normal content of type I and type III collagen. It is conceivable that the reduced content of type I collagen in the aortic wall is responsible for the weakness of the vessel wall causing formation of aneurysm and its sequelae.
