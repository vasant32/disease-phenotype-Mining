In neurosurgical practice, the term 'spinal meningocele' is generally used to describe a congenital spinal malformation including protrusion of the spinal meninx from the congenitally dysraphic vertebrae. Although non-dysraphic meningocele is very rare, it is usually associated with neurofibromatosis or Marfan's syndrome in the literature. Thoracic and/or lumbar spinal levels are the most common localization. Anterolateral localization of meningocele is very rare in the cervical region. Operative treatment is indicated if the lesion is symptomatic. Detailed radiological assessment of the meningocele is necessary since it may be associated with neuroma in the sac. If the neuroma is found in the meningocele, an anterior surgical approach should be considered for the treatment of both of the lesions.
