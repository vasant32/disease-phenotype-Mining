AIM: Dural ectasia is a major diagnostic criterion for Marfan syndrome using the Ghent nosology. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of three different radiological methods previously proposed for the assessment of dural sac diameter in Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Marfan syndrome was diagnosed in our study using the Ghent criteria, disregarding dural ectasia as a criterion. Three proposed radiological methods were applied to measure dural sac diameter, examined for 41 patients (18 patients with and 23 without Marfan syndrome) by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Using Oosterhof's method, 94% of the patients with and 44% of the patients without Marfan syndrome fulfilled the criteria of dural ectasia. According to Villeirs, dural ectasia was diagnosed in 18% of the patients with and in none of the patients without Marfan syndrome. With Ahn's method, dural ectasia was found in 72% of the patients with and in 44% of the patients without Marfan syndrome. In only two patients with Marfan syndrome was dural ectasia diagnosed by all three methods. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal overt discrepancy between the three methods of assessing dural ectasia. Considering the key role played by dural ectasia in reinforcing the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome according to the Ghent nosology, a standardized and reliable method should be sought.
