From 1972 to 1980, 41 patients (aged 19 to 79) with aortic root problems have been managed surgically with a composite graft. Forty patients (97.5%) are long-term survivors who to date have had no complications related to the aortic root. This series of patients included 10 with acute dissection of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Thirty-one patients undergoing elective operations for aortic root aneurysms included three with chronic ascending aortic dissection with aortic regurgitation, three with previous operations on the aortic root, and six patients who had associated coronary artery bypass or mitral valve replacement. Follow-up to 8 years shows that patients with composite graft replacement have exhibited no early or late complications of this procedure. Two late deaths at 1 1/2 and 5 1/2 years were unrelated to the aortic root procedure. Experience seems to indicate that composite graft management of aortic root aneurysms is a most reliable and durable operation for the majority of patients with this disease.
