A 35 year-old male with Marfan's syndrome was referred with a fortuitous echographic finding of an abdominal aorta flap. Transthoracic echocardiography showed moderate aortic regurgitation and an aneurysm in the sinus of Valsalva. Computed tomography demonstrated an aneurysm in the sinus of Valsalva 60 mm in size and a DeBakey type IIIb dissection extending from the left subclavian artery to the right common iliac artery. An aortic valve-sparing operation (reimplantation), total aortic arch replacement and the elephant trunk method were used in this patient. An aortic valve-sparing operation is preferable because the patient is young, and has no need for anticoagulant therapy after surgery. The extent of the aortic reconstruction, including the intact aortic arch, was appropriate to prohibit future dilatation of the aortic arch and retrograde dissection from a DeBakey type IIIb dissection.
