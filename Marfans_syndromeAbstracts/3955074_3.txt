The type III/I + III collagen ratio was studied in intima-medial samples of ascending aortas obtained from patients with the Marfan syndrome or other annulo-aortic ectasia (dilatation of the ascending aorta) and from control subjects, using electrophoretic analysis of cyanogen bromide peptides. The [3H]borohydride-reduced crosslinks of collagens were analysed by ion-exchange chromatography. Type III/I + III collagen ratios were twice as high in adult aortas as those found in skin samples of the same age. This ratio was lower in fetal and very young aortic samples and in 6-8 out of 12 pathological aortas (including one sample from a Marfan patient) when compared with adult controls. In contrast, the type III/I + III collagen ratio was high in fetal or very young skin and the values obtained from several patients did not differ from those of the control skin samples. In one pathological aorta out of six studied, the concentration of the reducible crosslink, dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine, was higher than in controls, suggesting increased collagen synthesis or impaired maturation of collagen. These changes point to altered collagen metabolism in aortas of patients with annulo-aortic ectasia.
