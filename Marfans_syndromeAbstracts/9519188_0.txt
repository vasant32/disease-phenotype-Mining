We describe a patient with the Marfan syndrome who presented with an acute aortic dissection. She underwent composite graft replacement of the aortic root. She returned two years later with dyspnoea and stridor due to tracheal compression by a large chronic dissection of the thoracic aorta. Marfan patients are at risk of chronic dissection involving the remaining distal aorta and require regular noninvasive assessment following surgery.
