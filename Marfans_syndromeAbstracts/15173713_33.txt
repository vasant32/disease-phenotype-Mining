 OBJECTIVE: Sparing the aortic valve has become a surgical option for patients who require repair of aortic root ectasia and have normal valve leaflets. Surgical approaches to valve sparing differ with regard to preservation of the native sinuses of Valsalva. The role of the sinuses and the importance of maintaining them remain controversial. METHODS: By using a time-resolved, 3-dimensional, phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging technique, aortic root and aortic blood velocity data were acquired from 2 patients with Marfan syndrome 6 months after aortic valve-sparing surgery with straight Dacron grafts and contrasted with data from 6 normal volunteers. RESULTS: In normal aortas vortical blood flow became apparent in the individual sinuses after peak systole. The vortices filled the available space behind the valve leaflets and persisted until diastole, expanding and moving inward during aortic valve closure. In contrast, no vortices were observed in the postoperative patients with Marfan syndrome with negligible sinuses. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in supravalvular flow accompany loss of sinus architecture. Whether the presence, size, and velocity of supravalvular vortices affects the function or durability of the preserved aortic valve remains to be studied.
