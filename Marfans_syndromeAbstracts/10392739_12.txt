To describe the surgical technique used in the repair of a large scleral perforation in a patient with Marfan's syndrome and a past history of various surgical interventions in both eyes. Scleral homograft and amniotic membrane transplant were used to reconstruct the large scleral defect present in his left eye. One month after surgical intervention, the patient showed excellent restoration of the scleral perforation without signs of inflammation or infection. The combination of scleral homograft and amniotic membrane transplant constitute an effective alternative to autologous scleral and conjunctival grafts when these cannot be used.
