The aorta is an integral part of the cardiovascular system and should not be considered as just a conduit for blood supply from the heart to the limbs and major organs. A range of important pathologies affect the aorta and are responsible for a high level of morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Many of these conditions are seen in the adult congenital population, especially as advances in diagnosis and treatment mean these patients are surviving well into adulthood. As we gain a greater understanding of these disorders, especially the underlying genetics and pathophysiology, it becomes clear that the aorta is a highly complex part of the vascular tree. As such, the aorta requires increasingly sophisticated imaging techniques for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients. The advantages and disadvantages of the various imaging techniques available to clinicians will be discussed in the context of both acute and chronic aortic pathology.
