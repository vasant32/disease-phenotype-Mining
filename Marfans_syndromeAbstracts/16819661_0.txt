AIM: This retrospective study should examine and judge the surgical indications and the therapeutic possibilities as well as their complications in patients with ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome (MFS) diagnosed according to the criteria of the Ghent nosology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 17 patients. Operative indications were increasing subluxation of the lens, retinal detachments and secondary glaucoma. The operative procedure depended on patient age and findings. Eleven MFS patients were operated in both eyes and six MFS patients in one eye. RESULTS: Stabilization or functional improvement of visual acuity could be achieved in all patients in whom no disorders limiting visual acuity or amblyopia were present preoperatively. In six eyes of five patients, lens insertion was accomplished via a pars plana approach. Lens removal without implantation of an intraocular lens was performed in 16 eyes of 10 patients. Pars plana vitrectomy was accomplished in 12 eyes. Complications were well controlled by pars plana vitrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Difficult preoperative situations and postoperative complications are not rare in MFS patients. However, they can be controlled well by means of modern vitreous surgery.
