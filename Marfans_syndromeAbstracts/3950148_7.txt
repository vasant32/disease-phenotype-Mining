Computed tomography with contrast enhancement permits noninvasive follow-up of patients treated for aortic dissection. We used CT to examine 52 patients with aortic dissections for up to 14 years postoperatively. The mean interval between surgery and CT was 32 months. Computed tomography demonstrated the aortic graft in 45 patients. Persistent patency of a false lumen was observed in 40 cases. In one case, CT demonstrated extension of the dissection. No rupture or thoracic pseudoaneurysm was noted in our series.
