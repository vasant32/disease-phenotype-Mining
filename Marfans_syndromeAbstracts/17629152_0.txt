Patients with Sy. Marfan, in their great number, find the problem with pathological findings on the heart, but the most dealing complications of this illness are rupture and dissection of aneurismatic aorta. Carefully approach, adequate intervention and what kind of treatment decision, may upgrade quality of the lifestyle and prolong lifespan in this patients. However, the most common death cause in those patients is still rupture of aorta. Treatment of the patients with this problem should go in direction that solves dissection, aortic insufficiency and malperfusion Sy. The most dissection cases are solved by implantation of the valve conduit and reimplantation of the coronary orifices. Some surgeons prefer preservation of the aortic valve, therefore others establish complication prevention pattern with applying surgical treatment before appearance of the complications. In this study we would like to present experience of the Sarajevo Heart Center and our results in the 6 Marfan Sy. cases, within the last two years. We were in position to witnes strong hereditary connection among father and his two daughters who have the same illness. Complications caused by Marfan were successfully removed by surgical treatment. Surgical treatment consists of replacing ascending aorta and in same time replacing coronary ostia using Shelhigh-stentless valve conduit. The same surgical procedure we have performed on two sisters resulted with repair of dissection in first sister's case, and acted complication preventive to the other sister. All this facts indicate necessity for the closeness of the center that is, with experience of employees and their medical and surgical capability, versatile to treat and improve lifestyle to people with Marfan.
