 BACKGROUND: When treating dissecting aneurysm of the thoracoabdominal aorta surgically in patients with Marfan syndrome, we have usually performed graft replacement- including the entire thoracoabdominal aorta and reconstruction of all visceral branches, even if dilatation is mild in some segments-to avoid further aortic operations in the follow-up period. METHODS: From October 1999 through July 2011, 20 consecutive patients with Marfan syndrome underwent repair of dissecting aneurysm of the thoracoabdominal aorta (median age, 45 years; range, 19-65 years). All patients underwent surgical intervention with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage and distal aortic and selective organ perfusion. Deep hypothermia was used in 13 patients for spinal cord protection. RESULTS: No in-hospital mortality was observed. One patient had temporary spinal cord ischemia but was fully recovered by discharge. Other complications included exploration for bleeding (n=1), prolonged ventilation (n=1), and graft infection (n=1). At a mean follow-up of 54 months (range, 9-129 months), 1 patient had died of interstitial pneumonia at 38 months postoperatively. Survival at 8% years was 91.2±9.0%. Two patients required additional aortic procedures (total arch replacement and aortic valve-sparing surgery). Actuarial rate of freedom from aortic operations at 8 years was 83.9%±10.5%, but no patient needed required repeated thoracotomy for an aortic procedure. Neither false nor patch aneurysms were observed using computed tomography (CT) during follow-up surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Graft replacement for dissecting aneurysm of the thoracoabdominal aorta in Marfan syndrome offers good early and long-term results. We believe total aortic replacement including the entire thoracoabdominal aorta and reconstruction of all visceral arteries should be recommended for selected patients with Marfan syndrome.
