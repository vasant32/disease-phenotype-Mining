Atrial fibrillation is rare in childhood that had not been reported in neonates with normal cardiac morphology and function. The authors present a newborn who underwent surgical repair of a tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia at the age of 2 days and experienced atrial fibrillation 16 days after the procedure. A report of 35 pediatric patients in a single center over a period of 22 years identified atrial fibrillation in children with a variety of ailments including congenital cardiac anomalies before and after corrective surgery, rheumatic valve disease, Marfan's syndrome with mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia of infants, and cardiac tumors [2]. All these patients had underlying cardiac disease.
