Marfan syndrome is a hereditary disease of the connective tissue with increased mortality mostly due to changes of the cardiovascular system. We describe our experience with the surgical treatment of 243 patients with Marfan syndrome and cardiovascular complications. We report the results of treatment of annulo-aortal ectasia using the classical surgical methods of Bentall DeBono and Cabrol and the method for preservation of the native aortic valve and concomitant surgery of the mitral valve. Reconstruction or replacement of the mitral valve is mainly based on the classical indications. Preservation of the native aortic valve and reconstruction of the mitral valve in patients with Marfan syndrome is possible but the long-term results are still unknown.
