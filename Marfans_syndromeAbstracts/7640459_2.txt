This report describes our experience of treating a 5-year-old boy with annuloaortic ectasia and a presumptive diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome. He had elongation of the distal aortic arch and dilatation of the abdominal aorta. Surgical repair of annuloaortic ectasia was successfully carried out using Cabrol's operation, following which no significant perioperative complications developed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Cabrol's operation being successfully performed on a child aged 5 years or less.
