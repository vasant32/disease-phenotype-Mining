Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue that can affect the heart, blood vessels, lungs, eyes, bones, and ligaments. It is characterized by tall stature, elongated extremities, scoliosis, and a protruded or caved-in breastbone. Patients typically have a long, narrow face. A high-arched palate produced by a narrow maxilla and skeletal Class II malocclusion due to mandibular retrognathia are other common features. For a patient with no family history of the disorder, at least three body systems must be affected before a diagnosis can be made. Individuals affected by the syndrome routinely seek orthodontic treatment to correct the orofacial manifestations. In this report, the authors present the records of three patients with Marfan syndrome who were treated at a dental school. Two patients had severe periodontal disease in the absence of significant contributing local factors. The presentation of systemic symptoms and typical physical characteristics varied. The syndrome thus went unnoticed in one patient for many years. We discuss here the observed intraoral findings and the progress of orthodontic treatment to provide a brief overview of the challenges involved in treating such patients.
