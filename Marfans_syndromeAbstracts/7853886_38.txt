Patients with aneurysms of the ascending aorta or aortic root frequently have aortic insufficiency despite normal aortic leaflets. The aortic valve dysfunction is caused by dilatation of the sinotubular junction, distortion or dilatation of the sinuses of Valsalva, annuloaortic ectasia, or a combination of these problems. In the case of annuloaortic ectasia, reconstruction of the aortic root is performed by reimplanting the aortic valve in a tubular Dacron graft (reimplantation). In the case of mild or no annuloaortic ectasia, reconstruction of the aortic root is performed by correcting the dilated sinotubular junction and replacement of the aortic sinuses if they are also dilated with an appropriately tailored Dacron graft (remodeling). From July 1989 to March 1994, 45 patients have had either reimplantation of the aortic valve (19 patients) or remodeling of the aortic root (26 patients). Fourteen patients had Marfan's syndrome, 11 had acute and five had chronic type A aortic dissection, and nine also had transverse arch aneurysm. There were two operative deaths, both in the remodeling group. One patient who had reimplantation needed composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta because of persistent aortic insufficiency after the repair. A young patient with Marfan's syndrome had progressive aortic valve dysfunction during a growth spurt and had aortic valve replacement 2 years after the initial operation. No other valve-related complication has occurred. The remaining 41 patients have only mild or no aortic insufficiency, and the repair remains stable from 1 to 58 months, mean 18 months. These two types of aortic valve reconstruction have provided excellent clinical results in carefully selected adult patients.
