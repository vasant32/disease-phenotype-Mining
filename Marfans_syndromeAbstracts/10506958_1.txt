Imaging of the aorta has greatly benefited from the recent development of helical computed tomography. This noninvasive and widespread imaging technique could be considered as a viable alternative to invasive modalities in aortic disease assessment, especially in the acute onset. Radiologists should be familiar with the principles of this technique and its clinical applications. This report develops technical aspects, typical and atypical features of a variety of noncongenital aortic diseases including dissections, aortic trauma, aneurysms, nonaneurysmal atherosclerotic diseases and arteritis. The role of helical CT as noninvasive tool for imaging the aorta and its branches is compared to the other imaging methods.
