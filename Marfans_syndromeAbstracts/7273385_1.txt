Coronary arterial obstruction associated with congenital aortic valve disease is rare in children. We studied two children with aortic valve disease and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. Cineangiography revealed localized obstruction of the proximal left coronary artery. In one patient, a membrane-like structure partially covered the left sinus of Valsalva, almost isolating the ostium of the left coronary artery; the other patient had severe stenosis of the proximal left coronary artery and a congenitally hypoplastic left coronary cusp. Surgical repair was successful in both cases. Symptoms of myocardial ischemia in children with aortic valve disease should be investigated promptly to exclude obstruction of the coronary arteries.
