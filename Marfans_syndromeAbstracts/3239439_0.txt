The clinical, hemodynamic and pathological findings of 13 patients with aortic regurgitation due to aortic valve prolapse caused by advanced myxomatous degeneration were evaluated. Eleven patients showed a favorable outcome with no complications resulting from surgery. One patient died from aortic dissection, and another died suddenly from an unknown cause. Five patients had mitral valve prolapse as a complication. Ten patients (77%) had a long-standing history of hypertension. Twelve patients (92%) were male. None of the patients had the stigmata of Marfan's syndrome. All patients had marked myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valves without any inflammatory changes. Two patients showed microcalcification; 7 demonstrated moderate fibrosis. Five patients showed severe fragility of the cusps which appeared redundant, gelatinous and softened by degenerative changes. Myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve is not rare, and, in fact, it may be one of the most common pathologic and clinical entities associated with pure aortic insufficiency.
