We evaluated the long-term results of 28 operative survivors who underwent surgical repair for acute type A dissection. Residual dissection of the thoracic aorta was found in 21 patients (75.0%) postoperatively, and 6 of them underwent reoperation with no operative death. There were 2 late death; one died in the third operation for thoracoabdominal aorta and the other died of cancer. Two of 4 patients with Marfan's syndrome required total aortic replacement ultimately. Since the elective reoperation can be performed safely, careful follow-up and management is essential for the improved survival of the patients with residual aortic dissection.
