Imaging and color flow Doppler echocardiography are an integral part of any evaluation of a patient with the Marfan syndrome.  The major cardiovascular manifestations of this condition are aortic dilation, which may involve the proximal and distal aorta, aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral regurgitation. Patients who have the Marfan syndrome should have serial echocardiograms to measure aortic root diameter carefully at the sinuses of Valsalva and subsequent levels (sinotubular junction, arch, descending and abdominal aorta).  Additionally, color Doppler echocardiography assists in the diagnosis of aortic dissection and facilitates evaluation of the severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation that commonly complicate the Marfan syndrome. The risk of aortic dissection, which is the most serious manifestation of the Marfan syndrome, increases as the aorta enlarges.  Therefore, elective composite graft surgery is recommended when the aortic root size reaches 60 mm, regardless of symptom status, or 55 mm in the presence of severe aortic regurgitation.  Surgical replacement of the aortic root with a composite graft does not end the disease process.  Color flow Doppler is useful in the diagnosis of dehiscence of the conduit sewing ring, coronary artery aneurysm, distal aortic dissections, and prosthetic valve dysfunction.
