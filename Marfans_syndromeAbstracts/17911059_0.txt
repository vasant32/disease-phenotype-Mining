We describe 2 surgical cases of acute aortic type A dissection during pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome. Both of them underwent emergency aortic root replacement under deep hypothermia; one patient was in her 21(st) week of pregnancy and the other was treated 1 day after a normal delivery. The patients experienced fair postoperative courses, but intrauterine fetus death was confirmed in the first case.
