A 44-year-old male with Marfan's syndrome had undergone an initial operation for DeBakey type I acute aortic dissection with annulo-aortic ectasia. He had undergone replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with a composite graft and reconstruction of the coronary artery by the Cabrol procedure. At 5 years after the initial surgery he experienced chest pain and was subsequently examined. Computed tomography revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the ascending aorta and the residual aortic dissection. The maximum diameter of the pseudoaneurysm was 85 mm and the maximum diameter of the aortic arch was 55 mm. The aortic arch was associated with an aberrant right subclavian artery. Angiography revealed that the pseudoaneurysm was caused by leakage at the coronary ostium-graft anastomoses. We repaired the anastomoses and performed total aortic arch replacement with reconstruction of four arch branches. The postoperative course was uneventful without any complications. We report this case because there have been few reports regarding arch replacement in cases with an aberrant right subclavian artery.
