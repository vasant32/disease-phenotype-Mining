During the diagnostic evaluation of a 31-year-old male with Marfan syndrome, an acute type B aortic dissection, and rising creatinine, the retrograde loop of our selective catheter inadvertently engaged the entry tear of the dissection in the mid-descending aorta. Traction on the catheter led to a full circumferential dehiscence of the remaining lumen, causing an intimointimal intussusception down to the level of the celiac artery with complete collapse of the true lumen and visceral and renal artery obstruction. Balloon fenestration and supramesenteric stenting of the true lumen decompressed the intussuscepted intimal flap and restored normal perfusion pressures.
