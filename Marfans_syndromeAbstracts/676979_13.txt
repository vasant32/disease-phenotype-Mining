Echocardiograms from 562 patients were examined for evidence of the pattern of tricuspid valve prolapse. Criteria for the diagnosis can be established similar to those applicable to mitral prolapse. In 500 consecutive patients without mitral valve prolapse, there were no cases of isolated tricuspid valve prolapse. Eleven of 53 (21%) patients with mitral valve prolapse also had tricuspid valve prolapse. Four of six (67%) patients with Marfan's syndrome and mitral valve prolapse also had tricuspid valve prolapse. The occurrence of this echocardiographic pattern as an isolated finding as well as associated with mitral valve prolapse was significantly less than previous angiographic reports. Patients with both these findings tended to be older than those with mitral valve prolapse alone, but clinically differed in no other way. Use of standardized technique can minimize errors in diagnosis.
