To determine which therapeutic procedure is most appropriate for which type of aortic dissection, we investigated 146 cases of acute aortic dissection. In the group with dissection of the ascending aorta, 58.6% of patients given medical therapy and 48.8% of patients given surgical therapy died. In the group with dissection of the descending aorta, 14.0% given medical therapy and 50.0% given surgical therapy died. High mortality in the medical group with type A dissection was caused by delayed operation. Better survival was achieved in treated than surgically treated patients with acute distal dissection. In patients with cardiac tamponade, aortic regurgitation, hemothorax/hemo-mediastinum, visceral ischemia and peripheral ischemia, mortalities following medical treatment were fairly high. Surgical treatment brought on improvement in mortality in these groups. However, in the cases complicated by renal dysfunction, the mortality in the surgical group was higher than that in the medical group. 42 patients (28.8%) had no evidence of any complication and only 6 (14.3%) died. In 20 cases (47.6%) of uncomplicated dissection, no blood flow was observed in the false lumen. In cases with open false lumen, the following abnormal findings were more conspicuous: thrombocytopenia, decreased level of fibrinogen, increased fibrin degradation product and soluble fibrin monomer complex. However, these changes seem to be minimal in cases with thrombosed false lumen. The measurement of coagulation factors may be one useful method to determine which therapeutic procedure is most suitable.
