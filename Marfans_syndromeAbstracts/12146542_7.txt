BACKGROUND: Connective tissue disorders, such as some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, have been associated with severe periodontitis. METHODS: This report describes a case of Marfan's syndrome, an inherited disorder of connective tissue caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene, in which the patient presented with severe periodontitis. RESULTS: At examination, an average full-mouth clinical attachment level loss of 5.6+/-2.1 mm, furcation involvement, and severe alveolar bone loss were observed in a 41-year-old Caucasian male. Tooth hypermobility was also present. CONCLUSIONS: This case appears to be the first documentation of severe periodontitis in a patient with Marfan's syndrome. It supports the hypothesis that a variety of connective tissue disorders may confer increased susceptibility to periodontal tissue breakdown.
