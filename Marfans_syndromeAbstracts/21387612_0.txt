Marfan syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder with ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems and often causes acute aortic dissection. Interestingly, there have been several reports of familial thoracic aortic dissection in patients with autosomal dominant diseases without Marfan syndrome. Variation of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR) gene is reported to be one of the causes. We report a case of a familial aortic dissection not associated with Marfan syndrome, with mutation of TGFBR type 1. Hereditary aortic dissection of the non-Marfan syndrome that does not have clinical manifestations is not uncommon. Thus, the existence of familial aortic aneurysm should be in mind in diagnosis and treatment.
