 PURPOSE: Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder historically defined by well-characterized features in the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. To date, there have been no reports concerning abdominal visceral findings in this disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of abdominal visceral findings in patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Computed tomography or magnetic resonance studies of 69 patients with Marfan syndrome and an age- and sex-matched cohort of control subjects were reviewed. The presence of abdominal visceral findings was noted. Chi-square and Student t tests were used to determine significance of differences between the patient and control groups. This retrospective study was approved by the local institutional review board and determined to be exempt from Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act reporting requirements. RESULTS: Renal cysts were present in 41 Marfan patients (59.4%) versus 21 control subjects (30.4%), P=0.001. The average number of renal cysts was greater in Marfan patients than controls (2.4 vs. 0.9, P=0.005). Hepatic cysts were present in 24 Marfan patients (34.8%) versus 12 control patients (17.3%), P=0.02. The average number of hepatic cysts was also greater in Marfan patients than controls (0.9 vs. 0.3, P=0.027). Cholelithiasis was present in 12 Marfan patients (18.1%) versus one control patient (1.5%), P<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Marfan syndrome patients have liver and renal cysts more often, in increased number, and at an earlier age than controls, in addition to an increased prevalence of cholelithiasis. Further study will be needed to relate these findings to recent developments concerning the underlying molecular genetics of this disorder.
