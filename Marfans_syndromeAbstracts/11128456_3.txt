The elephant trunk technique was developed to facilitate multiple-stage treatment of extensive aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. However, little information is available concerning its usefulness for aortic dissection. From April 1992 to July 1998, we used the elephant trunk technique for treatment of aortic arch dissection in 22 patients (including 19 men) with a mean age of 58.5 years (range 21 to 85 years). Twelve patients presented with type A dissection (acute in 3 and chronic in 9), 3 with type B acute dissection, and 7 with "non A/non B" dissections with retrograde extension to the aortic arch or entry site located in the aortic arch without involvement of the ascending aorta. All patients had aneurysms of the descending (n = 7) or thoracoabdominal (n = 15) aorta. Procedures were performed under hypothermic circulatory arrest at between 15 degrees and 20 degrees C. Antegrade cerebral perfusion was used in three cases. The procedure was associated with aortic valve replacement and/or coronary bypass in 6 cases and bypass of one or more supraaortic vessels in 13. In two patients the distal end of the elephant trunk was attached with an endovascular prosthesis during the same procedure. The ensuing results in these patients indicate that the elephant trunk technique can be highly effective for treatment of complex aortic arch dissection.
