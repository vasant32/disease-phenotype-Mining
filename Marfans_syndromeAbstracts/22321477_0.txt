Isolated iliac artery aneurysms are rare in the general population (0.03%) and represent 2% of all abdominal aneurysms, and the association with Marfan syndrome is even rarer. We report a Marfan syndrome case with an isolated common iliac artery aneurysm treated by using a modified "stent-graft sandwich" technique, with preservation of the internal iliac artery perfusion. The modified "stent-graft sandwich" technique involves building an appropriate proximal neck just in the common iliac artery for fittingly housing two new stent-grafts inside, both deployed simultaneously and each one going to both distal iliac arteries (internal and external).
