Excretion of pyridinoline and polypeptide-bound hydroxyproline with urine was studied in 27 children with hereditary impairment of connective tissue. At the same time, effects of beta-adrenoblocking agents and vitamin complex, prescribed during preoperation period before thoracoplasty in hereditary chest deformation, were investigated. Clinical efficiency of the treatment depended distinctly on the initial value of ratios pyridinoline/creatinine and polypeptide-bound hydroxyproline/creatinine. Total positive effect of the therapeutic course, considering also echocardiographic examination and postoperational complications, was observed in 44% of patients with Ehlers-Dunlop syndrome and in 75% of patients with Marfan syndrome.
