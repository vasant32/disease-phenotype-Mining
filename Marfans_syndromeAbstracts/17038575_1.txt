Endovascular techniques are being employed with increasing frequency in the management of peripheral arterial aneurysms. A 57-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome presented with a symptomatic 5 cm left subclavian artery aneurysm. He underwent successful endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm with immediate improvement of his symptoms. Duplex ultrasound 3 months after the procedure confirmed a patent graft and complete exclusion of the aneurysm.
