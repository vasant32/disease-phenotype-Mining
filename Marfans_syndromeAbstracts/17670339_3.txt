Two patients suffered from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) resulting from occlusion of left coronary perfusion graft limb after aortic root reconstruction by Cabrol or modified Cabrol technique. A 34-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome received aortic root reconstruction by modified Cabrol technique due to aortic root aneurysm and acute type A aortic dissection. AMI occurred 3 months after operation. Another patient, a 72-year-old male with annuloaortic ectasia and aortic arch aneurysm received Cabrol procedure and aortic arch replacement. He suffered from AMI 7 months following operation. Occlusion of the left coronary graft limb was noted in these two patients on computer tomography and coronary arteriography. They were both saved by emergency minimally invasive direct coronary bypass grafting (MIDCAB).
