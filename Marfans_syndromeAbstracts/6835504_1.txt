Familial aneurysms of the distal anterior cerebral artery are a neurosurgical rarity. We report a family with four of its members (a mother and three sons) suffering from subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured aneurysms, two of them being of the distal anterior cerebral artery. There was no evidence of endocarditis, septic emboli, coarctation of the aorta, or trauma. There was no family history of Marfan's syndrome, polycystic kidney, or hereditary connective tissue disorder. We believe that there has been no report in the neurosurgical literature of familial cases of distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms.
