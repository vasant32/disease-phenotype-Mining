For the first time Bernhard Marfan described the Marfan-Syndrome in 1896; it is a meso- and ectodermed variety with the conducting symptom of "arachnodactyly". Marfan-Syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder with high penetrance and variable expressivity. In our opinion this case of a 41-year-old patient with kidney cysts and aneurysma dissecans of the arteria ascendens by Marfan-Syndrome was described in the literature only twice. The casuistics of this Marfan-Syndrome patient shows a particular rare associated organ-change--the kidney cysts--and illustrate the frequency of this hereditary disease.
