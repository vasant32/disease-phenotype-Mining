Some dominant genetic disorders, viral processes and neoplastic disorders base their pathogenicity on the production of protein or proteins that negatively affect cellular metabolism or environment. Thus, the inhibition of the synthesis of those proteins should prevent the biological damage. A promising approach to decreasing the level of the abnormal protein(s) is represented by specific interference with gene expression at the level of mRNA. The specific suppression of the expression of an mRNA can be achieved by using ribozymes. Ribozymes are RNA molecules able to break and form covalent bonds within a nucleic acid molecule. These molecules, with even greater potential advantages than antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, are able to bind specifically and cleave an mRNA substrate. There are advantages to using ribozymes instead of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Ribozymes can inactivate the target RNA without relying on the host cell's machinery and they have the capacity to cleave more than one copy of the target RNA by dissociating from the cleavage products and binding to another target molecule. Most of the studies performed to date have described the use of ribozymes as therapeutic agents for viral and cancer diseases. However, some dominant genetic disorders may also benefit from this approach. This is the case for some connective tissue disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, Marfan syndrome and the craniosynostotic syndromes.
