We report the case of a neonate admitted to the hospital in the 4th day of life in severe heart failure due to aortic and mitral regurgitation with a largely dilated aortic root. The associated skeletal features involving the superior and inferior limbs as well as the thorax, and joint hypermobility, allowed the clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Despite favorable initial response to medical therapy, sudden deterioration led to death two weeks after birth. Typical necroscopic findings were confirmed and the case is considered the most severe clinical manifestation possible to be found in this syndrome.
