Between 1981 and 1989, ten patients underwent replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve by a composite graft for an aneurysm of the ascending aorta with aortic regurgitation. The first two cases using an SJM aortic valve prosthesis and Teflon felt-pledgeted mattress sutures for the proximal anastomoses required a coronary bypass graft from the tube graft to the anterior descending coronary artery because of difficulty in completing the graft-left coronary ostial anastomoses. In the subsequent seven cases, an SJM mitral valve prosthesis with a large, soft cuff for a valved conduit was sewn in reverse and a thin wall Teflon roll was used for the Teflon felt of the pledgeted mattress suture in the proximal anastomoses. As a result, anastomoses between the tube graft and coronary ostia were performed easily and successfully in eight patients. One case with Marfan syndrome required reoperation nine years after the first operation for recurrence of the aneurysm of the aortic arch. Thus, the need for careful and continued follow-up is important in the Marfan syndrome.
