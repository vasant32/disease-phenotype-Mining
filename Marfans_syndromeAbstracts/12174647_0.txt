Between January 1974 and December 2000, aortic root replacement was performed for 46 patients with Marfan syndrome. The hospital mortality rate amounts to 8.6% (4 patients out of 46). Fifteen (35.7% of survivor) of 42 survivor died during the period of follow-up. Eighteen of 42 survivor were developed cardiovascular events of 21 times and 11 patients had to be reoperated on at least once for a total of 12 reoperations. Nine of 15 late death patient died in relation to aortic dissection and pseudoaneurysm of distal anastomosis and coronary anastomosis. Actuarial survival rate was satisfactory for 10 years after aortic root replacement, but sharply decreased after postoperative 10 years. The use of non-sealed graft, classical Bentall method, reoperation and inclusion technique were risk factors for the late death.
