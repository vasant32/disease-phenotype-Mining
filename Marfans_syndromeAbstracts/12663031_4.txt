A 35-year-old white man with bilateral high myopia, astigmatism, subluxated crystalline lenses, and incipient cataract had phacoemulsification and implantation of a hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) (Alcon MA60BM) in both eyes. The subluxated capsular bag was stabilized and recentered using a scleral-fixated capsular tension ring (CTR) (type 1L, Morcher). Measured with Scheimpflug photography, the capsular bag and IOL were in a stable intraocular position during the 18-month follow-up. There were no major changes in refraction. Despite the sharp-edged IOL design, both eyes had posterior capsule opacification (PCO) 18 months after surgery that in 1 eye caused a decrease in visual acuity of more than 2 lines. High myopia and subluxated lenses may be treatable long-term with a scleral-fixated CTR and foldable IOL implantation; further evaluation of PCO is necessary.
