Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) posses multiple beneficial effects such as cardioprotection, cerebroprotection, nephroprotection which provide opportunity to select the most suitable drug for the target vascular bed (e.g. coronary, or cerebral circulation). In some clinical settings, combined therapy ACE-I with ARB (double blockage of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system) may appear the most effective. These drugs (especially ARB) may successfully prevent atrial fibrillation and play a protective role in metabolic syndrome. Recently, it has been demonstrated that losartan is able to inhibit vasodilatation of the aorta in Marfan syndrome, which might prevent sudden death due to aorta rupture. An increasing role of ARB is most beneficial in hipotensive therapy (inhibition/regression of hypertension-related organ damage). With particular interest, results of the ONTARGET study are being awaited. This study is focused on the effect of double blockage (ramipril and telmisartan) on reduction of the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure.
