OBJECTIVE: To improve life expectancy and prevent premature mortality in women with Marfan's syndrome. METHODS: During the development of a regional genetic register for Marfan's Syndrome the outcome of 91 pregnancies in 36 women with this condition was established retrospectively and the cardiovascular and obstetric complications documented. RESULTS: No patient had a significant cardiovascular abnormality limiting function before her pregnancy. Of 36 women, four had an aortic dissection relating to pregnancy and two others required aortic surgery following delivery. Thirty women had uncomplicated gestational histories. The incidence of obstetric complications did not exceed expectation. CONCLUSIONS: Women with Marfan's syndrome are at significant risk of aortic dissection in pregnancy even in the absence of preconceptional cardiovascular abnormality. Aortic root dilatation may be a predictor of risk but dissection may occur without significant dilatation. Guidelines for obstetric care are suggested and preconceptional assessment recommended.
