Acute aortic dissection is a rare clinical entity that mainly affects patients older than 50 years. It is unusual in younger patients and its presence has been traditionally associated with trauma, Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve and pregnancy. We present here, a case of a 30 year old pregnant female with acute aortic dissection type A (De Bakey II), without family history of connective tissue diseases and signs of Marfan syndrome.
