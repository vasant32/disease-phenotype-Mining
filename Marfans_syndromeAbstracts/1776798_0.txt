Marfan's syndrome only very rarely presents as a peripheral arterial complication. In the case described, dissection of the left iliac artery in a 52-year-old man presented as intermittent claudication of sudden onset and enabled the diagnosis of previously unrecognised Marfan's syndrome on the basis of great height, a dorsal kyphoscoliosis, a positive family history and aortic abnormalities. Treatment based upon vasodilators and platelet antiaggregation enabled a favourable outcome with frequent monitoring.
