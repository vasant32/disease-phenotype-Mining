A 28-year-old Marfan's syndrome woman was referred to our hospital because of sudden chest and back pain. She had received replacement of the descending and ascending aorta for acute aortic dissection previously in other two institutions. CT scan revealed the massive mediastinal hematoma and hemothorax which suggested ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the transverse arch. Emergent total arch replacement, re-ascending replacement and aortic root plasty successfully weve performed. She recovered uneventfully although she had residual thoracoabdominal dissecting aneurysm. It was suggested that total arch replacement should be performed for Stanford A type dissection in Marfan's syndrome.
