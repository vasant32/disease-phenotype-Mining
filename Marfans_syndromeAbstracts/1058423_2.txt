The first case in the dental literature of congenital contractural arachnodactyly (C.C.A. syndrome) is presented. This newly delineated syndrome is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of connective tissue. Its similarities to Marfan's syndrome and homocystinuria, as well as other syndromes, are discussed. The lack of cardiovascular disease, specific ocular anomalies, and mental retardation are presented in the differential diagnosis of the C.C.A syndrome with Marfan's syndrome and homocystinuria.
