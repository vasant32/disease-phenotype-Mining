Twenty-seven patients in whom a diagnosis of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm had been made during life were re-examined and the results have been evaluated. The clinical symptoms are not diagnostic. Routine radiological examination may also fail to show any significant findings. Large sinus of Valsalva aneurysms may show an atypical prominence of the right upper heart border, and in leutic aneurysms there may be fine calcification of the aortic wall. A definitive diagnosis can be made only by thoracic aortography. Five patients had a congenital saccular aneurysm connected with a sinus of Valsalva. Three patients had acquired aneurysms of which two were leutic and one developed shortly after rheumatic fever. A diffuse aneurysms of the sinus of valsalva was found in fourteen patients with Marfan's syndrome. The radiological appearances are demonstrated. Indications for surgery are discussed; the indications must be considered for each situation separately.
