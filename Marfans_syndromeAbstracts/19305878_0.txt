 OBJECTIVES: The authors report a retrospective study of patients who underwent a Bentall procedure in the Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Department of Hospital Santa Maria, Lisbon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained from 42 patients who underwent the Bentall procedure between 1991 and 2008. Different parameters were compared as well as the short and long term results. RESULTS: The median age was 58,5 years being 88% of patients of male gender. 32 (76,27%) presented with ascending aorta degenerative aneurism, 6 p (14,3%) with type A aortic dissection and 4p (9,5%) with Marfan syndrome. 10p(23.8%) had associated coronary artery disease and there were 6p (14.3%) who underwent emergency surgery. Among the risk factors associated, 24 p (57,1%) had hypertension, 12 p (28,6%) dyslipidemia, 4p (9,5%) had history of smoking, 7 p (16,7%) diabetes, 6 p (14,3%) CPOD, 2 p (4,8%) renal dysfunction and 2 had a recent myocardial infarction. There were 7p (16,7%) with left ventricular dysfunction (EF<40%); 25 p were in NYHA class II-III. The hospitalar mortality was of 2,77% in non-emergent cases, and 33,3% in emergent operations. After 30 days, 92,8% of patients were alive. The 1-year survival was 90,4% and after 5 years of 85,7%. CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure obtained good results in short and long term and, despite the emerging of new and more complex techniques like remodelling and reimplantation, our results support the maintenance of this procedure as the preferential treatment for aortic root and valvular disease.
