PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Techniques of aortic root replacement have been developed that preserve the native aortic valve. These techniques avoid anticoagulation in patients who would otherwise receive a composite valve graft with a mechanical valve. RECENT FINDINGS: Longer-term data on the longevity of the main two techniques of aortic valve-sparing operations, the root remodeling and the valve reimplantation technique, are now becoming available. Root remodeling appears to have acceptable outcomes in patients without annuloaortic ectasia or Marfan syndrome. In such patients, the aortic valve reimplantation technique provides superior longevity because it provides external support for the aortic annulus and prevents ongoing dilatation. SUMMARY: Although aortic valve-sparing operations are being performed more frequently, particularly in younger patient populations, these procedures have not been adopted in the current guidelines. The excellent long-term outcomes of such procedures should facilitate their widespread adoption.
