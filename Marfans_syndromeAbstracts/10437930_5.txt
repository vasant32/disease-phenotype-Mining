Pes planus is a term frequently used in describing flatfoot; however, no study has objectively defined flatfoot. We evaluated the single leg stance footprint of 40 feet in 21 people with no history of foot problems, using pressure-sensitive film and a Harris mat. The medial and lateral aspects of the forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot were assessed. The midfoot was further analyzed by dividing the medial midfoot force by the total midfoot force. The mean medial midfoot force/total midfoot force was 11.1% (SD = 6.5%). Pes planus was defined as the medial midfoot force/total midfoot force > 24.0% (mean + 2 SD). A population associated with pes planus (124 feet in 63 patients with Marfan syndrome) was then evaluated in the same fashion. Although the mean medial midfoot force/total midfoot force was not statistically different (16.0%), a distinct group of patients (25%) had forces that were outside the range of normal midfoot forces.
