The etiology of valvular heart diseases (VHD) has changed in the last 50 years in the industrialized countries. A significant reduction in the incidence of rheumatic fever and its sequelae, increase in life expectancy, recognition of new causes of VHD and advancement in technology are responsible for the metamorphosis of the etiology of VHD. Heritable disorders of connective tissue (marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, adult polycystic kidney disease, floppy mitral valve/mitral valve prolapse); congenital heart disease (bicuspid aortic valve); inflammatory/immunologic disorders (rheumatic fever, AIDS, Kawasaki disease, syphilis, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome); endocardial disorders (nonbacteremic thrombotic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, endomyocardial fibroelastosis); myocardial dysfunction (ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy); diseases and disorders of other organs (chronic renal failure, carcinoid heart disease); aging (calcific aortic stenosis, mitral annular calcification); postinterventional valvular disease; drugs and physical agents are all clinical entities associated with VHD. It should be emphasized that VHDs still constitute a major health problem which will increase with the aging population.
