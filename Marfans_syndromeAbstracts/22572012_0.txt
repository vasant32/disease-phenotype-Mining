Aneurysmal disease is uncommon in children, and its presence often leads to suspicion of genetic disorders (Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), trauma, and infection. We describe the case of a newborn boy with generalized left lower limb hypoplasia associated with diffuse areas of arteriectasis combined with areas of stenosis and fusiform aneurysms of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries. No additional vascular territories were affected. The patient was asymptomatic, and no therapeutic intervention has been considered. Numerous complementary imaging and laboratory examinations failed to establish a definitive diagnosis. This collection of findings has not been previously reported.
