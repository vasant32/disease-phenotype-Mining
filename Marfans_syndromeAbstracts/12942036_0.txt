 BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder affecting many structures, including the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart and blood vessels. It is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder due to a mutation of a gene encoding fibrillin-1, which affects connective tissue. Few case reports have associated Marfan syndrome with vascular malformations of the brain and spinal cord. In this regard, association with intracranial aneurysm has been vaguely proposed. CASE REPORT: We report here a patient with Marfan syndrome who was admitted because of a sudden loss of consciousness. The patient underwent computed tomography (CT) examination, which disclosed a right intracerebellar hematoma. Cerebral angiogram did not demonstrate aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or evidence of any other vascular lesions or neoplasms in the posterior fossa. Conservative treatment was undertaken. The clinical course was uneventful and after 6 weeks the patient was discharged free of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with Marfan syndrome are at high risk of vascular abnormalities, a clear association with cerebral aneurysm has not yet been established. Our experience and the contrasting reports available in the medical literature strongly warrant further studies in order to better clarify this controversial association.
