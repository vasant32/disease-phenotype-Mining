The metacarpal index (MCI), a radiographic measure of the slenderness of the metacarpals used in screening for the Marfan syndrome, was measured in 185 normal children ranging from two to 18 years of age. The MCI increased from lower values in early childhood to the adult range by approximately 10 to 11 years.
