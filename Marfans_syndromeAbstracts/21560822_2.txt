 BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to assess long-term morbidity and mortality with special regard to prosthesis durability after aortic root replacement with the Hancock bioprosthetic porcine conduit. METHODS: Between 1975 and 2004, a total of 81 patients (55 males, 26 females; mean age 58 +/- 18 years) underwent aortic root replacement with the Hancock conduit for aortic dissection (n = 22; 27%), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 57; 70%), or porcelain aorta (n = 2; 3%). Twenty-five patients (31%) underwent an emergency operation, 12 (15%) presented with Marfan syndrome, and eight (10%) had undergone previous cardiac surgery. Concomitant procedures were performed in 26 cases (32%). The follow up was 98% complete; the mean follow up was 4.8 +/- 4.0 years (range: 1 day to 16.7 years), and the cumulative follow up was 403 patient-years. Actuarial event-free rates were calculated, and valve-related complications classified according to guidelines for reporting morbidity and mortality after cardiac valvular operations. RESULTS: There were seven (9%) operative deaths and four (5%) in-hospital deaths. Actuarial survival rates at five and 10 years (excluding operative deaths) were 77.0 +/- 5.3% and 54.0 +/- 7.5%, respectively. Actuarial freedom from aortic valve reoperation at five and 10 years was 98 +/- 1.6% and 64 +/- 10.2%, from structural valve deterioration 88.1 +/- 4.7% and 49.9 +/- 9.6%, from thromboembolic events 87.4 +/- 4.6% and 75.1 +/- 9.5%, and from major bleeding events 90.2 +/- 3.9% and 75.4 +/- 8.1%, respectively. Among redo procedures, the stentless Hancock valve could be excised without separating the synthetic graft from the left ventricular outflow tract, and a stented valve prosthesis thus implanted. Hence, it was possible to avoid a second Bentall operation. CONCLUSION: The long-term survival rates after aortic root replacement with the bioprosthetic Hancock conduit were reasonable for this demanding patient cohort. However, the durability of the prosthesis was inferior to that reported for the stented Hancock valve substitute. The key benefit of this bioprosthetic valved conduit was the simplified redo procedure.
