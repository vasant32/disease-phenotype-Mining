The Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Defects in fibrillin, an elastin-associated microfibrillar protein, are now known to cause MFS. Since the discovery of fibrillin as the gene responsible for MFS, requests for prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis have become common-place. Here we report the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using fluorescence labelled primers and an automated sequencer, to establish linkage data for 'molecular diagnosis'. The mistaken clinical diagnosis of MFS based on the appearance of a common cardiovascular manifestation, mitral valve prolapse, and a positive family history is also discussed.
