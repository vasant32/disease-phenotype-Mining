From 1958 to March 1987 we corrected 704 patients with pectus excavatum. The condition occurred more frequently in boys (544 patients) than girls (160 patients). In the majority of patients (86%), the defect was evident at birth or within the first year of life. Musculoskeletal abnormalities were identified in 133 patients (scoliosis, 107; kyphosis, 4; myopathy, 3; Poland's syndrome, 3; Marfan's syndrome, 2; Pierre Robin syndrome, 2; prune belly syndrome, 2; neurofibromatosis, 3; cerebral palsy, 4; tuberous sclerosis, 1; and congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 2). Sixteen patients had associated congenital heart disease. A family history of chest wall deformity was present in 37% of the cases and a history of scoliosis in 11%. Surgical correction was performed using a uniform technique for bilateral subperichondrial resection of the deformed costal cartilages and sternal osteotomy resecting a wedge of the anterior cortex and fracturing the posterior cortex. Anterior displacement was maintained with silk sutures closing the osteotomy defect. In 28 early cases, the sternum was secured by intramedullary fixation with a Steinman pin. All repairs were completed with a low complication rate (4.4%; pneumothorax, 11; wound infection, 5; wound hematoma, 3; wound dehiscence, 5; pneumonia, 3; seroma, 1; hemoptysis, 1; hemopericardium, 1). Six complications were associated with Steinman pin fixation (hemoptysis, seroma, hemopericardium, pneumothorax, 3). Major recurrence occurred in 17 patients (2.7%) and led to revision in 12. Satisfactory long-term results were achieved in the remaining 687 patients, with follow-up ranging from 2 weeks to 27 years. Mean follow-up was 4.3 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
