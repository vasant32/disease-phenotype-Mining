The aim of this study was to assess the results of 5-year experience with minimally invasive operation without medial incision and resection cartilages for correction of pectum excavatum. From 2000 we made in our Hospital minimally invasive technique for the correction of pectus excavatum. 75 patients were treated by minimally invasive technique. A convex steel bar is inserted under the sternumtrough small bilateral Incisions. The steel bar is inserted with the convexity facing posteriorly, and when it is in position, the bar is turned over. After 2 years the bar is removed when permanent remolding has occurred. Initial excelent results were maintained in 54 patients (normal chest), good results in 16 (mild residual pectus) and poor in 5 (severe recurrence requiring further treatment). The mean follow-up since surgery were 3 months to 3 years. Average blood loss was 25 ml. Average length of hospital stay was 8 days. Patients returned to full activity after 2 month. Complications were pneumothorax in 12 patients, pneumonia in 6 patients and displacement of the steel barr requiring revision in 2 patients. Poor results occurred because steel bar was too soft in 3 patients, and soft sternum in 2 patients with Marfan's syndrome. The minimally invesive technique is effective without cartilage incision and resection or sternal osteotomy.
