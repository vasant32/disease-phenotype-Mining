A thorough cardiovascular evaluation is necessary to detect potentially lethal abnormalities that may predispose children and adolescents to sports-related sudden death. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva are the two most common cardiac abnormalities associated with sudden death during childhood. Other conditions potentially associated with sudden death are Marfan's syndrome, aortic valve stenosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, and arrhythmias. A detailed medical evaluation is indicated for subjects who have a history of nonvasodepressor syncope, exercise-related syncope or presyncope, angina pectoris, or known congenital or acquired heart disease. In addition, a family history of premature sudden unexpected syncope or death, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, premature atherosclerotic heart disease, severe arrhythmias, or Marfan's syndrome or premature aortic aneurysms is an indication for a thorough cardiovascular evaluation before participation in sports.
