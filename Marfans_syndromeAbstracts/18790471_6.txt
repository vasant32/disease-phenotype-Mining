 PURPOSE: To report the short-term outcomes and complications of iris-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PCIOL) in the pediatric population. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case study. METHODS: Twelve consecutive pediatric patients (17 eyes) underwent placement of foldable iris-sutured PCIOLs between September 1, 2004 and September 30, 2007 by two anterior segment surgeons at a single academic center. Outcome measures included change in visual acuity (VA) and complications. RESULTS: In our series, there was a higher rate of dislocation of iris-sutured IOLs in patients with a history of ectopia lentis resulting from Marfan syndrome or hereditary or idiopathic causes than in patients being treated for aphakia resulting from other causes (45% vs 0%). Mean final VA improved by 0.23 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units from preoperative baseline. One eye of a Marfan patient sustained a retinal detachment eight months after dislocation of the PCIOL, and one patient experienced iris capture of the IOL after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Iris-fixated IOLs are reasonable alternative to transsclerally sutured IOLs to correct aphakia in pediatric patient. Dislocation of the IOLs can occur, however, and there is concern for suture degradation over time. The procedure should be considered with caution in pediatric patients.
