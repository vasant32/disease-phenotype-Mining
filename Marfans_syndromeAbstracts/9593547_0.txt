The Marfan syndrome patient undergoes care by many different physicians for the treatment of the varied systems affected by this connective tissue disorder. The most frequent visits are to a cardiologist, with referral to a cardiovascular surgeon who attends to the problems of dilatation and dissection of the ascending aorta. Follow-up is lifelong. Although currently some surgeons prefer to resuspend rather than replace the aortic valve, composite valve graft replacement for aortic root dilatation and aortic valve insufficiency has steadily improved patient outcome. At the same time, the almost daily discoveries of genetic science show great promise in eliminating connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome in the not-too-distant future.
