Active prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) as a complication of acupuncture requiring valve surgery has not been reported previously. We report a case of PVE in a patient with Marfan's syndrome as a complication of acupuncture, who underwent emergency redo aortic root and valve replacement with a homograft. This report highlights the need for prophylactic antibiotics before acupuncture in patients with prosthetic valves, and also describes the use of a homograft as an effective surgical strategy.
