Thirty-four patients of ascending aortic aneurysm associated with aortic regurgitation were treated with simultaneous aortic valve and ascending aorta replacement utilizing composite graft, until December 1990. Twenty-four patients of the group were diagnosed as Marfan's syndrome and 17 had aortic dissection. For the operative procedure, Bentall's technique were employed in 25 patients and other modifications in nine. Operative death was observed in three cases (8.8%) due to low output syndrome, caused by coronary ostium abnormality, all in Marfan's syndrome. Late death was observed in six including 2 hospital deaths of cerebro-vascular disturbance and sepsis. Other causes of death were rupture of residual aneurysm (in 3) and LOS at reoperation (in 1). Hospital survivors remarkably improved in NYHA class and in cardiac size. Actuarial survival in 3, 5, 7, and 10 years were 78%, 72%, 72%, and 62% respectively. Therefore, surgical result of composite graft technique in our institution proved to be reasonable as others. However, long term result of the procedure should be carefully evaluated, because of the anatomical and histopathological peculiarity of the disease.
