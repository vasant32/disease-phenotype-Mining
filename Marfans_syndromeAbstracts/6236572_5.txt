Congenital abdominal aortic aneurysms are medical curiosities because of their rare occurrence even in groups with hereditary derangements of connective tissue metabolism (e.g., Marfan's syndrome and Ehlers- Danlos syndrome). We present the case of a 2 1/2-year-old boy with a congenital aneurysm of the aortoiliac bifurcation managed by excision and graft replacement. No associated disorder of connective tissue or other pathogenetic mechanism was discovered in this patient. The authors have summarized the existing literature regarding these rare but potentially lethal aneurysms.
