Bilateral pneumothoraces and aortic dilatation developed in a 25-year-old white man with marfanoid habitus, dysmorphic features, web neck, and intellectual impairment. He had physical features suggestive of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. We review the common characteristics of Marfan and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndromes and compare them with our case. Physicians should beware of potential cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with marfanoid habitus and dysmorphic features.
