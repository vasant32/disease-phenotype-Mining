Aortic incompetence in Marfan's syndrome results from distortion or dilatation of the sinuses of Valsalva, annuloaortic ectasia or a combination of these problems. Valve leaflets in these patients are macroscopically normal in spite of aortic insufficiency. Replacement of the ascending aorta, root and aortic valve with a composite graft was, for a long time, the treatment of choice for Marfan patients. Valve-preserving procedures (remodeling or reimplantation) provide the advantages of avoiding the shortcomings of standard surgical techniques, and maintaining the functional integrity of the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract, aortic root and ascending aorta. We developed a modified valve-sparing reimplantation technique for avoiding leaflet damage. This was achieved by leaving a 'cushion' of aortic wall (8--10 mm) that, sewn on the Dacron graft, works as a 'damper' and prevents leaflets injury during the systolic opening of the valve. For final judgment of this operative method long-term results are necessary.
