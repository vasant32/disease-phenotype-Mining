Long-term follow-up was obtained for 161 patients who underwent a modified Ravitch repair of pectus excavatum. In all cases, the substernal strut was fashioned from a Dacron vascular graft. Follow-up was done by telephone (most cases) and also by office visit (43 cases). The follow-up period was 12 months to 21.5 years. One hundred thirty-three patients (83%) had satisfactory chest contour; 17 had a fair result, and 11 had frank recurrence. Risk factors for poor contour were an asymmetrical defect, a severe defect, and associated congenital anomalies. Of the three patients with Marfan's syndrome, all had recurrence. One hundred thirty (81%) had a satisfactory scar, and 31 had hypertrophic scars. Risk factors for hypertrophic scar formation were increasing age and weight, and tripod internal fixation used early in the series. Factors not contributing to clinical outcome include the sex of the patient, positive family history, perioperative complications, year of surgery, surgeon, and type of incision. The use of a Dacron strut is relatively easy and complication-free. It can be left permanently in situ. Long-term results have been good, except in patients with an extensive or asymmetrical deformity, and in those with other congenital anomalies, especially Marfan's syndrome.
