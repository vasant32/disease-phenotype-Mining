The classic clinical features of Marfan syndrome include ectopic lens, valvular heart disease and dissecting aneurysm, and long, narrow extremeties associated with tall stature. When the classic features are incomplete, diagnosis is uncertain. This study presents some radiographic measurements of the skull in patients with the Marfan syndrome, in an attempt to aid diagnosis by quantitating the features defining the syndrome. Compared with the normal skull, the Marfan skull was found to be longer, taller, thicker, and to have have increased frontal sinus area. The most consistent and therefore diagnostic abnormality ws increased height.
