This set of guidelines is designed to assist the pediatrician in caring for children with Marfan syndrome confirmed by clinical criteria. Although pediatricians usually first see children with Marfan syndrome during infancy, occasionally they will be called on to advise the pregnant woman who has been informed of the prenatal diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Therefore, these guidelines offer advice for this situation as well.
