The clinico-immunogenetic analysis of 47 patients with Marfan's syndrome and 83 patients with chest deformities combined with valvular prolapses and other connective tissues dysplasias elucidated a close relation of HLA-antigens allele variants with clinical dysplasia variants and specific immune alterations. The findings support the suggestion that clinical heterogeneity of connective tissue dysplasia forms results from their pathogenetic heterogeneity.
