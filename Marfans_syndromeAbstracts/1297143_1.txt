The Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue associated with characteristic abnormalities of the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems. Common cardiovascular manifestations of this syndrome are mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation and dilatation of the ascending aorta resulting in aortic insufficiency, dissection, aneurysm and/or rupture. Although the prognosis for a patient with the Marfan syndrome is significantly more favorable than it was ten years ago, the cardiovascular complications continue to greatly reduce life expectancy. This article presents an overview of the Marfan syndrome including: history and epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, surgical intervention and follow-up. A case study is outlined which focuses on priority nursing diagnoses and a plan of care.
