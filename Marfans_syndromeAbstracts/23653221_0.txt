Keratoconus (KC) is an eye disease characterized by the progressive thinning and protrusion of the cornea, which results in the loss of visual acuity. This disorder remains poorly understood, although recent studies indicate the involvement of genetic and environmental factors. Recently, we have found that the distribution of the cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX) is markedly decreased in about 63 % of keratoconic specimens. Similarly, LOX activity is significantly reduced by 38 % compared to control tissue. Nearly 70 systemic disorders have been reported in association with KC, most of them affecting the extracellular matrix. In this review we attempted to ascertain whether any KC-associated diseases exhibit signs that may reflect LOX impairment. We hypothesized that very similar changes in the extracellular matrix, particularly at the level of collagen metabolism, including LOX impairment in mitral leaflets, may reflect an association between KC and mitral valve prolapse. Moreover, this putative association is supported by the high frequency of Down syndrome in both diseases. Among other disorders that have been found to coincide with KC, we did not find any in which the LOX enzyme may be directly or indirectly impaired. On the other hand, in cases where KC is present along with other connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and others), KC may not arise as a localized manifestation, but rather may be induced as the result of a more complex connective tissue disorder.
