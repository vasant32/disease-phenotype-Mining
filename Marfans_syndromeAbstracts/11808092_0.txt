OBJECTIVES: We have conducted aortic valve-sparing operation for patients having aortic root dilatation and almost normal aortic valve leaflets since August 1998, and here report midterm results. METHODS: Patients with dilated aortic annulus or Marfan's syndrome were treated with reimplantation, and the remaining patients with remodeling. Either 24 or 26 mm graft was selected based on aortic annular diameter and leaflet size. Aortic valve competence was assessed regularly with echocardiography. RESULTS: Five patients (age: 29 +/- 13 yr), including 4 with Marfan's syndrome, had undergone reimplantation, and 3 (age: 46 +/- 18 yr) remodeling by December 2000. Mean follow-up was 18 (range: 10-32) months, and no postoperative death has occurred and no reintervention has been required thus far. All the patients in the remodeling group showed only a small pressure gradient through the aortic valve and decreased left ventricular diameter. Two in the reimplantation group showed a pressure gradient exceeding 20 mmHg. Two Marfan's syndrome patients in the reimplantation group showed slightly increased diastolic left ventricular diameter and 3 slightly increased systolic left ventricular diameter. Although aortic regurgitation had diminished in all patients by discharge, moderate aortic regurgitation recurred in 1 non-Marfan's syndrome patient in the reimplantation group because of degenerated aortic valve. CONCLUSION: Although postoperative aortic valve function was not perfect in all patients undergoing reimplantation, midterm results after aortic valve-sparing operation were generally satisfactory. Proper selection of patients, procedures, and graft size was thought to be important to ensure a favorable surgical outcome.
