Of all the pathological forms and variations of Marfan's syndrome, aortic aneurysm is one of the most important because of the high risk of medial dissection caused by cystic necrosis. The value of computerised axial tomography in the diagnosis of the aortic lesions of Marfan's syndrome was assessed in three clinical cases. Compared to angiography and echocardiography, computerised tomography avoids arterial catheterisation while demonstrating all anatomical changes of the aorta, coronary arteries, pericardium and mediastinum, with significantly less radiation. The point of entry of the dissection was not visualised in two of the cases presented. Therefore, computerised axial tomography should be considered in patients with Marfan's syndrome.
