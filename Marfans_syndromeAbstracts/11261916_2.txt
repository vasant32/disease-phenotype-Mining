This report describes a case of a Stanford Type B aortic dissection (originating distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the aortic bifurcation and proximal left iliac artery) in a 31-year-old primigravid woman who was at 39 weeks gestation and had Marfan's syndrome. The dissection was managed conservatively. Caesarean section was performed under epidural anaesthesia with aggressive control of hypertension. Postoperatively, there was no extension of the dissection and no aneurysm formation. She was discharged from hospital two weeks after delivery and remained asymptomatic at six months. There are no plans for surgical intervention.
