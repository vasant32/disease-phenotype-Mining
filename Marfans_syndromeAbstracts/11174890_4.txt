Care of pregnant patients with congenital heart disease requires understanding of the specific congenital defect, the nature of previous surgical correction, and the residua and sequelae. General risks and principles can be adduced in management decisions. In addition, lesion- and patient-specific details are important. There are only a few conditions that place patients at a high enough risk to advise that pregnancy be avoided under all circumstances (pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, Marfan syndrome with dilated aortic root, severe aortic stenosis, and severe systemic ventricular dysfunction). Preconception counseling, optimization of status, and meticulous multidisciplinary management during pregnancy and the postpartum period will improve outcomes.
