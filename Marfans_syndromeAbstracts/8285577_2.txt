There appears to be an association between iliac artery aneurysm and Marfan's syndrome. A case of iliac artery aneurysm in a young male with the disorder is presented. The iliac aneurysm was successfully managed by arterial reconstruction with a prosthesis. Patients with Marfan's syndrome should be followed for signs of weakness of the peripheral arterial system.
