 PURPOSE: To report a case of acute hydrops with intrastromal cleft in a patient of keratoconus with associated Marfan's syndrome, treated with intracameral injection of perfluoropropane (C(3)F(8)) gas. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A nonexpansile concentration of perfluoropropane gas (0.2 ml) was injected intracamerally in the operating room under aseptic precautions. RESULTS: There was complete and rapid resolution of corneal edema. CONCLUSION: Intracameral perfluoropropane gas in nonexpansile concentration may be a useful modality for treatment of corneal edema in acute corneal hydrops.
