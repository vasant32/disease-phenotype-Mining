A 32-year-old man with distal skeletal manifestations of Marfan's syndrome had experienced shortness of breath and orthopnea for one month. Physical examination showed the presence of severe aortic regurgitation. Both noninvasive and invasive studies revealed that the aortic regurgitation was induced by previously undescribed peculiar and unusual etiology: diastolic prolapse of a circumferentially dissected tubular intimal flap into the left ventricle. The patient underwent surgical repair with striking clinical improvement.
