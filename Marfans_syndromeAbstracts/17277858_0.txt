Marfan Syndrome is an autosomic dominant genetic disorder of the elastic fibers of connective tissue. Although neonatal and infant forms of the disease exist, the classic Marfan Syndrome is the most frequent form of presentation in childhood and adolescence, with a hereditary background in 70 to 85% of cases. Due to the natural evolution of the disease, there is a progressive involvement of different organs or systems such as skeletal, cardiovascular, dura, ocular, skin-integument and lungs. However, the suspicion must arise on skeletal clinical aspects which are first evident signs. The cardiovascular involvement appears later but is the major life threatening complication. When suspecting Marfan phenotype, it is mandatory to apply Ghent criteria based on family history and clinical findings to establish the diagnosis. If diagnosis is confirmed, the severity of organ involvement must be assessed, to take preventive and/or therapeutic measures, including the search of new cases among relatives. When patients do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria, they must have a yearly evaluation considering the natural progressive evolution of the disease. The aim of this review is to spread and unify criteria on this disease whose diagnosis is eminently clinical, that requires early integral and updated management by a multidisciplinary group, to obtain the best quality of life and survival.
