Echocardiographic and phonocardiographic findings in 35 patients with Marfan's Syndrome and ten patients without Marfan's or other clinically apparent connective tissue disorders but with angiographic and echocardiographic evidence of mitral prolapse are reported and compared. Echocardiography revealed aortic root dilatation and/or mitral valve prolapse in 97% of the patients with Marfan's Syndrome. Aortic root dilatation was found in 60% of this group (74% of males, 33% of females) while mitral valve prolapse was found in 91% (87% of males, 100% of females). The incidence of aortic dilatation and mitral prolapse in patients with Marfan's syndrome was essentially equal in children and adults of the same sex. None of the nine adults or one child with mitral prolapse but without evidence of Marfan's Syndrome or other clinically apparent connective tissue disorder had aortic root enlargement. Ausculatory examination and phnocardiography revealed abnormalities in 54% of the patients with Marfan's Syndrome. Aortic regurgitation was found in 23% of this group (35% of males, 0% of females) while mitral regurgitation and/or mitral clicks were found in 46% (39% of males, 58% of females). Aortic regurgitation was much more frequent in adult males with Marfan's Syndrome (7/14, 50%) than male children (1/9, 11%), while the incidence of abnormal mitral sounds was essentially the same in adults (33% of males, 60% of females) and children (43% of males, 57% of females) of the same sex with Marfan's Syndrome. Abnormal mitral sounds were more frequent in patients without Marfan's who had mitral prolapse (90%) than in those with Marfan's (46%). It appears that cardiac abnormalities are a consistent manifestation of Marfan's Syndrome and that ultrasound is a more sensitive indicator of these abnormalities in such patients than ausculation or phonocardiography.
