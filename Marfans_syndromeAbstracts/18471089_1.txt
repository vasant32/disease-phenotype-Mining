Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene have been identified in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Marfan-like connective tissue disorders. In this study, two Chinese families were recruited. The patients in family 1 were well characterized with MFS, while those in family 2 displayed Marfan-like disorders such as ectopia lentis (EL) and marfanoid habitus, but did not develop cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to analyze the pathogenic mutations and their relationships with phenotypes in these two Chinese families. All participants underwent complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations. The 65 exons and flanking intronic sequences of FBN1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and screened for mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing. One hundred and fifteen unrelated controls were analyzed using the same methods to confirm the mutations. In family 1, we identified the mutation p.C499S in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (cbEGF)-like domain 3 of FBN1. In family 2, the mutation p.C908Y was identified in an interdomain region of the hybrid motif 2 linked to the cbEGF-like domain 10. It can be concluded that FBN1 mutations involving cysteine substitutions are usually associated with MFS and EL with some MFS features. Moreover, pathology seemed more serious when the mutations disrupted the three disulfide bridges in the cbEGF-like domains, which was more likely to cause typical MFS than if the mutations occurred in the hybrid motifs. Our data preliminarily establish a genotype-phenotype correlation in the diagnostic process of MFS and predominant EL with Marfan-like features.
