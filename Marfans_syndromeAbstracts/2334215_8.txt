An infant girl with arachnodactyly, spontaneously resolving contractures, dolichostenomelia, iridodonesis, and mitral and tricuspid incompetence died in cardiac failure. We confirm that congenital contractural arachnodactyly may exhibit serious cardiovascular and ophthalmic complications like Marfan's syndrome. The presence of iridodonesis further obscures the differentiation between classical Marfan's syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly.
