BACKGROUND: Pectus deformities and atypical costal anomalies are congenital thoracic wall defects that can cause a marked cosmetic defect with attendant psychological trauma and limited physical performance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 43 patients with chest wall deformities, 24 (55.8%) were pectus excavatum, 13 (30.2%) pectus carinatum and 6 (14%) atypical costal anomalies, in the last sixteen years. There were nine female and 34 (79.1%) male patients. The mean age of the patients was 14.4 years (range, 5 to 23). Scoliosis (13.5%), Poland's syndrome (5.4%), Marfan's syndrome (5.4%), neurofibromatosis (2.7%), atrial septal defect (2.7%) and mitral valve prolapse (13.5%) were associated with pectus deformities. The modified Ravitch's technique was used in pectus cases. Concomitant surgery was performed in two patients with pectus carinatum. RESULTS: The complications of pectus deformity repair were pneumothorax (24.3%), wound infection (8.1%), and local tissue necrosis (2.7%). There was no major recurrence, while minor recurrence rate was 10.8%. There was no mortality. CONCLUSION: Timely surgical procedures for the treatment of pectus deformities result in an excellent cosmetic outcome and improve cardiorespiratory function, providing both physical and psychological benefits.
