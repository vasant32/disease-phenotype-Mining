We studied tissue and cultured skin fibroblasts from a newborn with the lethal perinatal form of osteogenesis imperfecta born to a mother with the Marfan syndrome and her unrelated husband. Dermis from the infant was thinner and fibril diameter smaller than control; dermal fibroblastic cells had dilated endoplasmic reticulum. His fibroblasts in culture synthesized two different species of pro alpha 1(I) chains in about equal quantity. One chain was normal, the other contained cysteine within the triple-helical portion of the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide alpha 1(I)CB6. Molecules which contained two copies of the mutant chain formed alpha 1(I)-dimers linked through interchain disulfide bonds. Molecules which contained either one or two mutant chains were delayed in secretion and underwent excessive lysyl hydroxylation and hydroxylysyl glycosylation of all chains in the molecule, probably as a result of delayed triple-helix formation. Molecules containing either one or two copies of the mutant chain melted at 38 degrees C instead of 41 degrees C. The most likely explanation for these findings is that a cysteine is substituted for a glycine in the triple-helical domain of the products of one of the alpha 1(I) alleles. Such a substitution would interfere with triple-helix formation and stability and thus explain 1) the decreased melting temperature, 2) the increased post-translational modification, 3) the altered rate of secretion and accumulation of intracellular material, 4) the increased intracellular degradation of newly synthesized collagen, and 5) the decreased collagen production. Since neither parental cell strain produced the same mutant chain, the findings are best explained by a new mutation in one of the alpha 1(I) genes. The role of the uncharacterized "Marfan" gene in modifying the phenotype in this patient is unclear.
