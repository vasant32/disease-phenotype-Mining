BACKGROUND: Retinal detachment is a known complication of Marfan's syndrome. The literature is scarce on the results of surgery in these cases. PURPOSE: To determine the functional and anatomic outcome of retinal detachment surgery in Marfan's syndrome. METHOD: Retrospective review of charts of Marfan's syndrome patients who had retinal detachment surgery at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital between 1983 and 1995. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with 16 surgically treated eyes were identified. Retinal detachment was bilateral in 9/13 (69%) patients. The lens was ectopic in all eyes. Retinal breaks were small horseshoe tears or holes located anterior to the equator in 11/16 (69%) eyes. The retina of 12/16 (75%) eyes remained successfully reattached after a follow-up ranging from 4 to 132 months. All 12 eyes had visual acuity of 20/300 or better (range, 20/30-20/300). Eight of these eyes had visual acuity of 20/125 or better. The cause of failure in the remaining four eyes was proliferative vitreoretinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Results of surgical repair of retinal detachment in Marfan's syndrome were better than previously thought. Bilaterality of detachment is extremely high, which justifies considering prophylactic treatment of the fellow eye in these patients.
