Marfan syndrome (MS) is a rare connective tissue disorder, uncommon in otological practice. Ear surgery in MS has not been previously reported. An identical complication of meatoplasty developed in two patients with MS after modified radical mastoidectomy and meatoplasty for chronic otitis media. Both cases presented post-operatively with an external auditory canal narrowing when the walls of the initial meatoplasty in both cases collapsed. It is proposed that this occurred because of the inherent structural abnormality of the cartilage in Marfan syndrome. A simple technique of revision meatoplasty is described that resulted in successful management of these cases.
