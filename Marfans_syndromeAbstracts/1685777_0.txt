Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, with 3 different forms. MEN 2a consists of medullary thyroid carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma(s) and hyperparathyroidism. In MEN 2b, parathyroid hyperplasia is absent, but a Marfan-like syndrome and neuromas of the mucosae are present. In some families, the only manifestation of MEN 2 is a medullary thyroid carcinoma. These 3 forms seem to related to one or several gene(s) located in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. The histological lesions of MEN 2a are multifocal, bilateral and associated with hyperplasia (which affects C-cells in the thyroid gland). Screening for familial medullary thyroid carcinoma is based upon plasma calcitonin levels measured before and after a pentagastrin stimulation test. The demonstration of DNA markers near the gene(s) of the disease in chromosome 10 pericentromeric region makes it possible to identify, with good probability, the subjects at risk for the disease. It is only by determining the responsible gene(s) that subjects carrying the hereditary anomaly will be identified directly, without marker assays.
