Abnormal aortic arch anatomy is relatively uncommon but most frequently involves an aberrant right subclavian artery. Rarely, it is associated with aneurysmal dilatation of a chronic type B dissection. Under such circumstances, the abnormal anatomy may complicate therapeutics options. Furthermore, controversy exists regarding the use of surgical or endovascular techniques in patients with aortic aneurysms and underlying arteriopathies. The current literature is limited with regard to reporting of the latter. We present a hybrid approach to repair such an aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome. In a 2-stage procedure, involving initial supra-aortic bypass to all aortic arch branches, followed by endovascular stent graft deployment, the aneurysm was successfully excluded. There were no immediate complications and no evidence of endoleak at 3 months postoperatively, with thrombosis of the false lumen in the chest. By adapting hybrid open and endovascular techniques, complex thoracic aneurysms may be successfully treated in the short term in the presence of an underlying arteriopathy.
