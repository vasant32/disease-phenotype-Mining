Replacement of the ascending aorta and the aortic valve with composite graft, including reimplantation of coronary ostia, were performed in 84 patients from October, 1978 to December, 1989. Annuloaortic ectasia was the most common indication for surgery (76 patients). Thirty patients (36%) had the Marfan syndrome. Thirty-five patients were performed with original Bentall's procedure. Thirty patients were carried out with our modified technique like Inberg's, the coronary arteries were excised with attachment of the selected piece of the aortic wall, and implanted to the tube prosthesis with continuous suture. Nineteen patients were operated with modified technique by Cabrol or other interposition graft method. The actuarial free of death related to the operation of 4 years was 83%, 88%, and 74% (p = NS) in each methods respectively. The complications of anastomosis, for example, leakage and dilatation of coronary ostia were not seen in our modified Bentall's procedure. In conclusion, our modified method is proved to be reliable and competent.
