The Cabrol procedure is one of several techniques used for re-implantation of a coronary artery. After replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve using a composite graft, second Dacron tube grafts are used for anastomosis between the ascending aortic graft and the coronary arteries. Ostial stenosis is one of the complications associated with the Cabrol operation. However, there have been no reported cases of acute thrombosis of a Cabrol graft. Here we report a case with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction due to thrombotic total occlusion of a right Cabrol graft-to-right coronary artery (RCA) twelve days after surgery in a patient with Marfan syndrome. He was successfully treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
