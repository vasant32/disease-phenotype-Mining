Preferable surgical approaches to aortic diseases occurring between the aortic root and the arch in patients with functioning tracheotomy or permanent tracheostomy are described for securing adequate exposure and avoiding postoperative mediastinitis. Case 1: A 41-year-old man with Marfan syndrome presented with chronic type A thrombosed aortic dissection and severe aortic valve regurgitation. He had had a functional tracheostomy for managing respiratory function due to traumatic spinal cord damage. The heart and the ascending aorta were shifted to the right side of the chest and showed a significant counterclockwise rotation. Therefore, the reverse L-figure approach of a right-sided 3rd intercostal anterior thoracostomy and lower midline sternotomy was performed for Bentall operation. Case 2: A 76-year-old woman presented with thoracic aortic aneurysm of 11 cm in diameter. She had had a permanent tracheostomy with total laryngectomy. Therefore, cram shell approach was performed for total arch replacement. The 2 cases had no postoperative mediastinitis. These approaches are recommended for aortic diseases occurring in the ascending aorta or the aortic arch in patients with functioning tracheotomy.
