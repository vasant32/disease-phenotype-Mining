Marfan syndrome is an uncommon condition in pregnancy. Few district hospital obstetricians except those who work in areas with Marfan family clusters have experience in managing patients with this condition. Modern medical and surgical treatments have resulted in improved longevity and quality of life for many with this condition. For these reasons, there is an increased likelihood that more obstetricians may in the future have to manage a pregnant Marfan patient even though their involvement may only be in the early stages of her pregnancy. It is important that every district hospital obstetrician is aware of the implications of the condition in pregnancy and has a clear idea of the principles of management. This paper is based on experience gained from working in a district hospital in an area with a cluster of Marfan families and review of the relevant medical literature. The main risk is aortic dissection. Aortic root measurements and family history help to identify those at greatest risk.
