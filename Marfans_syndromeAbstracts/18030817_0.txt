Reduction to concentrations Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ in plasma sick, sufferings hereditary mesenchimmal dysplasia (MD) and associated with her platelets dysfunctions are revealed. The correlation analysis is organized between level of the breaches to concentrations essential mineral elements (EME) in plasma and functional bioactivity of platelets, as well as derived connective tissue (in particular, collagen and fibrinogens). The got data prove the important role EME in process intravascular activations of the platelets. On study proves the role trace elements as secondary messengers, providing directed current biochemical reaction, directed on before--and postaggregations platelets activation, as well as interaction last with component blood coagulation systems and structure vascular endothelial are called.
