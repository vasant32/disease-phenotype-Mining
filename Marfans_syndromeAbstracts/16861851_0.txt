 UNLABELLED: 1 over 700 newborns every year is born with cleft lip with/or without palate, in 30% of cases there is a certain genetic mechanism underlying development of disease: chromosomal anomalies, monogenic diseases, exposure to teratogens or in utero disruptive mechanisms. The objective of our study is to describe the most common genetic syndromes and associated anomalies in patients with CL/CP in Latvia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study material was medical records obtained from Riga Cleft Lip and Palate Centre Registry in a time period of 1980 till 2005. There was analyzed information about patients with identified genetic syndromes and associated anomalies. RESULTS: In a time period from 1980 till 2005, the following genetic syndromes were identified: Van der Woude, Fetal alcohol syndrome, Holzgreve syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Myotonic dystrophy, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Patau syndrome, Potter sequence and Pierre Robin sequence. 16% of CL/CP patients have recognized genetic syndromes or associated anomalies, including profound, severe and moderate mental retardation. Number is lower than expected, but still correlates with date presented in other populations. CONCLUSIONS: Long term follow-up of multidisciplinary specialists which includes cardiologists, clinical-geneticists and paediatricians, is needed for CL/CP patients with associated anomalies in order to identify timely side diseases and complications.
