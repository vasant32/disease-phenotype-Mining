 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening disease with a high rate of mortality. The dissection of the artery with a distal blood flow can explain the variable and changeable symptoms. Aortic dissections require immediate diagnosis and therapy. METHODS: In the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Hannover Medical School, 34 cases of aortic dissection were found during autopsy between 2006 and 2009. The cases were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: In the majority of cases (55.9%) an antemortem medical consultation has taken place. In only one case an aortic dissection could be diagnosed at a later time. CONCLUSION: Key in the management of acute aortic dissection is to maintain a high clinical index of suspicion for this diagnosis. Etiologically hereditary diseases (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome) should be taken into consideration as a possible cause. In all unexpected deaths of young adults an autopsy should be performed to detect the cause of death and for genetic testing to provide information for the relatives in case an aortic aneurysm can be found.
