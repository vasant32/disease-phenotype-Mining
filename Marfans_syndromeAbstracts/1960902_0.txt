A case of Marfan's syndrome associated with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm and mitral regurgitation in a 29 year old male is reported herein. The aneurysm was replaced with a Y-shaped graft using Crawford's technique, while the major branches of the abdominal aorta were separately cannulated from inside the aneurysm and perfused via partial extracorporeal circulation using a left femoro-femoral bypass. We found this technique useful in the prevention of tissue ischemia during the operation. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and he has encountered no problems in the year and half since his operation.
