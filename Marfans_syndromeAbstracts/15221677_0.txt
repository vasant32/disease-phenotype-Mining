 CASE REPORT: We report two aphakic patients with Brown-McLean syndrome. DISCUSSION: One patient was affected by Marfan syndrome, after having undergone lens subluxation surgery and aphakia 23 years previously. The other patient was aphakic due to cataract surgery with complications three years before. Our cases demonstrate that this syndrome can show a variety of clinical characteristics, but peripheral corneal edema is always present. A full understanding of the clinical signs of presentation is of great importance in order to detect this syndrome.
