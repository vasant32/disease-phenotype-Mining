PURPOSE: To describe a technique for iris fixation of acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) in ectopia lentis and evaluate the medium-term anatomical and functional results in children. SETTING: Pediatric Ophthalmology Department, Fondation Rothschild, Paris, France. METHODS: This retrospective study included 17 eyes of 9 children. The technique consisted of lens ablation, leaving in place the capsule in the zone of nonruptured zonule, and an IOL placement in the remaining sulcus with 2 iris sutures. The age of patients, postoperative complications, follow-up, anatomical results, final refraction, and visual acuity were noted. RESULTS: Median age was 4.8 years. One case of postoperative hyphema and 1 case of aseptic endophthalmitis occurred and resolved after treatment. The anatomical outcome was favorable in all cases, with centered IOLs and round pupils. Mean follow-up was 16.3 months. Mean final refraction was +0.18 diopter, and mean final best corrected visual acuity was 20/32 (range 20/50 to 20/20). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that iris fixation of foldable IOLs for ectopia lentis in children can lead to good anatomical and functional results. The use of the remaining part of the sulcus is helpful in reaching correct positioning of the IOL. The complication rate is similar to that with other techniques described in the literature, whereas the small incision and the absence of transscleral sutures could simplify the short-term and long-term evolution.
