The purpose of this study was to estimate the risk of heart diseases in pregnancy. A total of 594 patients with heart diseases treated at the National Cardiovascular Center between 1982 and 1993 were evaluated. The heart diseases were classified into eight categories: congenital heart disease with or without pulmonary hypertension (8 cases (1%) and 219 cases (37%), respectively), mitral valve prolapse (38 cases (6%)), valvular heart disease with or without valve replacement (9 cases (2%) and 54 cases (9%), respectively), arrhythmia (222 cases (37%)), cardiomyotitis (15 cases (3%)) and miscellaneous (29 cases (5%)). Maternal risk was estimated from the incidence of maternal mortality and artificial preterm delivery. Maternal death within two years after delivery was observed in 7 cases (1.2%): 4 cases with cardiomyotitis (3 DCM and 1 HCH), 2 cases with heart disease with pulmonary hypertension (1 PPH and 1 PDA), and a single case with valvular heart disease with aortic valve replacement. Artificial preterm delivery was carried out in 32 cases (5.4%), most frequently in cases with congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension (6/8, 75%) which follows cardiomyotitis (4/15, 27%) and cases with valvular heart disease with valve replacement (2/9, 22%). Fetal risk was measured by the incidence of fetal death, fetal growth retardation and congential heart disease of the fetus. IUFD because of maternal heart disease was observed in 4 cases: two cases with valvular heart disease with valve replacement, a single case with Marfan's syndrome and a single case with DCM. Fetal growth retardation was observed in 59 cases, most frequently in cases with congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension and cases with valvular heart disease with valve replacement (3/8 (38%) and 3/9 (33%), respectively). Neonatal congenital heart disease was found in 8 of 228 neonates (3.5%) whose mothers also had congenital heart disease. It is therefore suggested that intensive medical care be recommended in pregnancies complicated with congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension or with valvular heart disease with valve replacement, which increase both maternal and fetal risk, and in pregnancies complicated with cardiomyotitis which significantly increases the maternal risk.
