A 6-week-old girl presented with cutis laxa, emphysema, heart anomalies and a diaphragmatic hernia. She died at 22 weeks. A recurrent ctb(7)(q31.3) was found and the laminin gene was suspected to be involved in the disease. Anti-human laminin antiserum showed that this protein was absent from the skin. This case, together with 17 other similar cases, could represent a new type of connective tissue disease.
