From 1991 through 2001, 21 Marfan patients underwent aortic operations in our hospital. They received a total of 36 aortic operations, 31 by ourselves including 4 non-elective operations and 2 operations before 1991. Extent of replacement was Bentall + total arch (4), Bentall (8), valve sparing aortic root (reimplantation) (2), re-anastomosis + coronary aortic bypass grafting (CABG) after Bentall (1), ascending + total arch (3), ascending (1), total arch (1), total thoracoabdominal (10), thoracoabdominal (1), descending thoracic (2), distal arch (1), abdominal (2). Multiple operations were required in 11 patients (2 operations in 7, 3 operations in 4). Eight reoperations in 6 patients were for adjacent lesion, 5 reoperations were for remote lesion, and 2 others were for complication of Bentall (initial operation elsewhere). Among the 8 reoperations for adjacent lesion, 3 were scheduled operation (2 with elephant trunk), 4 were for residual dissection, and 1 was for annulo-aortic ectasia (AAE). Total aortic replacement was achieved in 4 and subtotal replacement excluding the root in 2. There was no hospital mortality. Paraparesis occurred in 1 who died 4.7 years after operation. The remaining patients are currently alive. No other aortic event occurred. Aortic reoperation-free survival was 83% at 5 year and 28% at 10 year.
