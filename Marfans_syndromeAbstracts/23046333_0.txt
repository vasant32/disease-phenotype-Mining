 PURPOSE: To assess changes in pulse wave velocity (PWV), a valid index of arterial stiffness, in patients undergoing endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Arterial stiffness is an independent marker of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive male patients (mean age 71±4 years) underwent elective EVAR (AAA group) after exclusion of patients with Marfan syndrome or other collagen-related disorders. Thirty-one age-matched men (mean age 69±5 years) without overt cardiovascular disease served as controls. PWV and clinical parameters were determined at baseline in both groups and after 6 months in the AAA group. RESULTS: At baseline, the groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, lipid profile, or blood pressure levels (p>0.05). PWV was considerably higher in AAA than controls (p<0.001). PWV positively correlated with mean blood pressure, AAA diameter, and age in univariate and multivariate analysis (R(2)=0.498, p=0.008). At 6 months after EVAR, PWV significantly increased from 13.11±3.57 m/s to 16.41±2.33 m/s (p<0.001) in the AAA group. CONCLUSION: Patients with AAA present with significantly elevated PWV levels compared to controls, and stent-graft repair is associated with a significant increase in the PWV. Whether those changes contribute to the cardiovascular risk in AAA patients needs further investigation.
