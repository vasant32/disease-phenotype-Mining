We report a surgical case of chronic aortic dissection with an entrance tear on Kommerell's diverticulum, a rare embryologic anomaly, with an extension to the arteria lusoria, in a patient with Marfan's syndrome. The operation consisted of aortic root and arch replacement with reimplantation of the right subclavian artery in the right carotid artery under circulatory arrest and deep hypothermia.
