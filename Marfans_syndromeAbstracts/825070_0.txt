The authors report the case of acute dissection of the aorta (type I) with sudden aortic incompetence occurring in a young lady of 25 years of age with Marfan's syndrome. An urgent operation had a successful outcome; the ascending aorta was resected in toto, and replaced with a prosthesis, the coronary arteries being reimplanted.
