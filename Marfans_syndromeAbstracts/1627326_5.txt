A case of Marfan syndrome with spontaneously and subsequently developed dissections of the aorta, one in the form of triple-barrel aorta, three times corrected by grafts is described. The autopsy revealed "healed" and acute dissections in almost the entire aorta outside the grafts. "Healed" thoracoabdominal dissection had true lumen (with entry and re-entry intimal tears), and old false lumen and in addition in its distal portion of a triple-barrel aorta was formed (dissection of healed aortic dissection). Lethal adventitial rupture occurred in the portion with an old false lumen. Dissection of the left subclavian artery, the right common carotid artery, resulting in saccular aneurysm, and avulsion of the right renal artery were also found.
