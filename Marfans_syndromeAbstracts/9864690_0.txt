Annuloaortic ectasia is often accompanied by Marfan syndrome and associated with infective endocarditis usually involving the mitral valves. We treated a patient with annuloaortic ectasia due to idiopathic cystic medial necrosis who developed congestive heart failure with aortic valvular vegetation. A 56-year-old man had dyspnea on effort since the beginning of January, 1997 and was admitted to our hospital on April 6, 1997 because of orthopnea. The diagnosis was congestive heart failure due to severe aortic regurgitation with annuloaortic ectasia detected by echocardiography. Medication and rest after hospitalization relieved his symptoms but congestive heart failure deteriorated after he had a high fever. At this time, a vegetation attached to the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve was found which had not been detected on admission. Blood culture yielded Streptococcus sanguis. The diagnosis was infective endocarditis involving the aortic valve. Surgical correction (Bentall method) improved congestive heart failure and he was discharged on August 4, 1997 without recurrence of endocarditis. Infective endocarditis involving the aortic valves is a possible cause of development or deterioration of congestive heart failure in patients with annuloaortic ectasia.
