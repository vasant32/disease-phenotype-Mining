Marfan syndrome is a disorder of the connective tissue that is inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion and that is caused by mutations in the gene coding for fibrillin-1, FBN1. Although complications of the syndrome may involve the eye, the lung and the skeleton, the high mortality of untreated cases results almost exclusively from cardiovascular complications, including aortic dissection, rupture and mitral valve regurgitation. The multiorgan involvement of many of these syndromes requires multidisciplinary expert centers that can increase the average life expectancy of affected patients from only 32 years to over 60 years. The present article both reviews classical standards of managing cardiovascular manifestations and highlights the surgical approach for aortic and mitral valve surgery in Marfan patients.
