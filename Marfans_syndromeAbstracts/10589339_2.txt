The Marfan syndrome and related disorders are systemic disorders of connective tissue. Proximal aorta is usually dilated. The molecular basis of Marfan syndrome has been elucidated, thus allowing prenatal diagnosis. Life expectancy has markedly improved due to the widespread use of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors and improved surgical management of the aortic disease.
