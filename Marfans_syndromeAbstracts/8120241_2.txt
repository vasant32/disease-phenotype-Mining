Dolichonychia is a descriptive term for elongated, slender nails. Although published observations of this finding are uncommon, dolichonychia has previously been seen in patients with connective tissue disorders, with hypohidrotic ectoderma dysplasia, or with abnormal hormonal states. Dolichonychia is a clinical feature which may be observed in patients with the Marfan syndrome. A woman with the Marfan syndrome and dolichonychia is described. Measurements of the patient's arm span, height, lower segment, hand length, and middle finger length were performed. In addition, the length-to-width ratio of each of her finger nails was determined. The mean of finger nail length-to-width quotients in the patient with the Marfan syndrome was 1.54. In conclusion, the detection of dolichonychia should prompt the physician to rule out associated systemic conditions: after eunuchoidism, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and hypopituitarism have been excluded, an evaluation for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and the Marfan syndrome should be considered.
