Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a recently-characterised genetic disorder with an autosomal-dominant inheritance due to mutations in the transforming growth factor beta-receptor Type 1 or Type 2 genes. We present a Chinese female neonate with genetically-confirmed Loeys-Dietz syndrome, cleft palate, hypertelorism, and an early dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta. This syndrome is associated with an aggressive arteriopathy, with an increased risk of dissection and rupture. Early diagnosis, close monitoring and early surgery may prolong the life in affected individuals. Losartan is an emerging therapy that may help slow down the rate of arterial dilatation.
