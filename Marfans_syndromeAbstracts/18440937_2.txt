Wandering spleen is a rare clinical entity characterized by splenic hypermobility resulting from laxity or maldevelopment of supporting splenic ligaments. Its major complication is splenic torsion, which is a potentially fatal surgical emergency. We present a rare case of wandering spleen with torsion and splenic infarction in a patient with marfanoid hypermobility syndrome and vertebral abnormalities.
