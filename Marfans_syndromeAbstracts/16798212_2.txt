 BACKGROUND: Here we report our surgical experiences with aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) aneurysm in 8 patients. METHODS: Eight patients underwent surgical treatment for ARSA aneurysm between March 1994 and June 2005. The age of these patients ranged from 20 to 75 years. The mean size of the ARSA aneurysm was 3.3 cm, ranging from 2 to 5 cm. The ARSA aneurysm was completely resected through a left posterolateral thoracotomy after reconstruction of the right subclavian artery through the supraclavicular approach in 4 patients (group 1). The ARSA aneurysm was excluded through a left posterolateral thoracotomy without revascularization of the right subclavian artery in 2 patients (group 2). The distal site of the ARSA aneurysm was closed followed by revascularization through a median sternotomy, and the ARSA aneurysm was left as a blind sack in 2 patients (group 3). RESULTS: None of the patients in group 1 or 3 had any postoperative complications. In group 2, 1 had a steal syndrome caused by the exclusion of the ARSA aneurysm, and the other died of sepsis 2 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Complete anatomical repair of the ARSA aneurysm could be performed through the combination of the supraclavicular approach and the left posterolateral thoracotomy, with excellent results. Exclusion of the ARSA aneurysm without revascularization resulted in a suboptimal outcome. Surgical results of simple closure of the ARSA followed by revascularization were uneventful, but the ARSA aneurysm was left as a blind sack.
