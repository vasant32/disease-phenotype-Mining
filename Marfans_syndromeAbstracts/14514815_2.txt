A 39-year-old man with Marfan syndrome underwent replacement of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta for acute type A dissection. Subsequently, he underwent infrarenal aortic replacement for aortic rupture and then graft repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm with patch-bearing intercostals. After the third procedure, massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage required three subsequent laparotomies. CT scan showed two thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysms at the patch-graft junction that were sequentially embolized with transcatheter delivery of thrombin.
