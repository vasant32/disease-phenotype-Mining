Twenty four patients underwent surgical treatment for ascending aortic lesions with aortic insufficiency at our institution. There were 16 male and 8 female patients from 12 to 67 years. Of 24 patients, 11 patients had Marfan's syndrome, and were younger at the time of operation. Three types of operative procedure were performed, that is, aortic valve replacement (AVR) and supracoronary graft replacement in 4 patients, AVR and covering the aneurysm of ascending aorta in 9, and composite graft replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta in 11. One patient died of perioperative myocardial infarction within 30 days after operation (early mortality rate, 4.2%). Another 5 patients died during the initial hospitalization, but no deaths were related to operative procedures. There was a total of 5 (27.8%) late deaths among the 18 patients follow-up with 5 and 10 years survival rate, 60.8%, 52.1%, respectively. Four of five patients was the cases with Marfan's syndrome. There were no statistically significant differences among three different procedures, but all patients who underwent composite graft replacement and left the hospital alive are doing well.
