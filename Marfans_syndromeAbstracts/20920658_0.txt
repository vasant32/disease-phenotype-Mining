Data on relational and sexuality issues in adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate relational and sexual behaviors, satisfaction, and functioning in a representative sample of patients with CHD and their partners. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the relation between sexuality parameters and quality of life. Relational and sexuality issues were assessed using a sexuality questionnaire in 133 patients (52% men, 37 Â± 13 years old) with CHD (43 with coarctation of the aorta, 42 with transposition of great arteries, 36 with Marfan syndrome, and 12 with Eisenmenger syndrome), and 74 partners. Quality of life was assessed using the Dutch translation of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey. Data were compared to an age- and gender-matched control group (n = 3,642). Seventy-one percent of patients with CHD were involved in a relationship, which was significantly less compared to controls (79%, p < 0.05). Nonetheless, patients perceived their relationship as more satisfactory compared to controls (p < 0.05). Overall, sexual satisfaction was equal in patients compared to controls, although they perceived lower body esteem (p < 0.001), decreased sexual esteem (p < 0.05), and more distress during sex (p < 0.001). Patients reported no more erectile and lubrication problems compared to partners and to controls. We found significant associations between most relational and sexual parameters and quality of life. In conclusion, many aspects of sexuality are affected in adult patients with CHD, whereas their partners remain relatively unaffected. Moreover, sexuality is an important aspect of quality of life in these patients. We advise physicians to be receptive to discuss sexuality issues and provide patients with adequate therapy.
