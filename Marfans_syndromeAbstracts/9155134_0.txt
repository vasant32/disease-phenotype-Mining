We performed aortic valve sparing operation in two cases of annulo-aortic ectasia combined with Type A aortic dissection. Marfan syndrome was found in one case and the dissection was acutely evolving in another case. The aortic valves were observed as normal configuration in both cases and then reimplanted within the synthetic grafts along with the David's procedure. No aortic regurgitation was found in the acute case but slight regurgitation was checked out in the Marfan case at the discharge. The aortic valve preserving operation for annulo-aortic ectasia was considered much effective in cases with aortic dissection in order to expect the thrombolization in the pseudo lumen.
