A 4-year-old boy with Marfan's syndrome had severe visual impairment after subluxation of the crystalline lens with bisection of the pupil. In the first eye, a capsular tension ring and an intraocular lens (IOL) were uneventfully placed in the capsular bag after phacoemulsification. During implantation of the endocapsular tension ring in the second eye, an inadvertent tear of the anterior capsule occurred, and the posterior chamber IOL was placed in the sulcus. In both eyes, severe lens epithelial proliferation with secondary IOL decentration developed postoperatively. Several surgical revisions were necessary to keep the IOL within the optical axis. In the eye with the sulcus-implanted IOL, the endocapsular tension ring was markedly decentered.
