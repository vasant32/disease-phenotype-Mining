Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause deficient processing of fibrillin-1, the main constituent of extracellular microfibrils, affecting tissues displaying elastic properties. Clinical manifestations are widespread and involve the skeletal, ocular, cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, skin and integumentum, and dura. A highly arched palate and retrognathia have been assigned to the symptoms with minor diagnostic specificity, although epidemiological data on prevalence are lacking yet. Twenty-six patients with MFS (n = 26) were studied for craniofacial characteristics using cephalometric measurements on lateral cranial radiographs. The purposes of this study were (1) to compare cephalometric variables of MFS group with age- and sex-matched population norms, and (2) to assess differences in palatal vault dimensions among adult MFS (n = 17) and matched controls (n = 32) by means of cephalometric measurements. Significant differences with population norms were found in the structures of the cranial base, the maxillary complex, the mandible body, and the relations of the jaws with respect to the cranial base and to each other. Palatal height and palatal length were significantly larger in MFS, and were significantly correlated to each other and to the height of the maxillo-alveolar processus. The present data disprove in part previously reported findings, possibly due to biased patient selection in these studies or demographic differences. However, a strong correlation was found between maxillary/mandibular retrognathia, long face, highly arched palate, and MFS. A combination of both intrinsic genetic factors and environmental factors is suggested as a possible explanation for specific morphogenetic aspects of the craniofacial complex in MFS.
