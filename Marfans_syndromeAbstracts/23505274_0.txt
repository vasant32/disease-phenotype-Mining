A 24-year-old Ugandan woman was referred for a neurology opinion after complaining of a year long history of right-sided retro-orbital stabbing pain. Brain imaging revealed a coincidental 3 mm left ophthalmic artery aneurysm. Marfanoid habitus was noted; after further investigations she was diagnosed with mild aortic root dilatation, subtle lens dislocation and Marfan syndrome. Her symptoms were secondary to temporomandibular joint dysfunction, an under-recognised complication of Marfan syndrome. Her ophthalmic artery aneurysm is likely to be a coincidental finding.
