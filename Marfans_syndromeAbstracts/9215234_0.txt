A previously well 35-year-old female was referred to hospital with a four-week history of intermittent chest pain. She had a history of Marfan syndrome when she presented 11 years previously with aortic insufficiency and underwent replacement of the aortic root with a composite graft. Magnetic resonance examination of the chest and coronary angiography revealed an area of extraluminal flow posteromedially at the base of the aortic graft with no evidence of dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography clearly demonstrated the presence of a pseudoaneurysm that resulted from detachment of the left coronary artery from the graft, with intermittent compression of the aortic graft during systole. The patient underwent uneventful resection and replacement of the false aneurysm and patch repair of the left coronary artery. This unusual case illustrates the presence of a pseudoaneurysm as a result of detachment of the left coronary artery from a Dacron graft 11 years after a composite graft replacement.
