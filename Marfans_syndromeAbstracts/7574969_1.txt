Obstruction of the left coronary ostial anastomosis is a rare late complication after composite graft replacement of the ascending aorta and the aortic valve with separate Dacron coronary grafts. Intimal proliferation caused by the turbulent blood flow at this site may be the cause of the obstruction, which is considered a possible cause of late cardiac events such as sudden death and global myocardial infarction. We describe a case of tight stenosis at the left coronary ostial anastomosis in a 38-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome who had undergone a composite graft replacement that employed separate Dacron coronary grafts.
