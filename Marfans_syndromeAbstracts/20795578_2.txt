The authors describe a modified technique for extraction of a dislocated crystalline lens or large and hard lens fragments displaced into the vitreous cavity. An ophthalmic viscosurgical device was used around and on top of the heavy liquid bubble to keep the lens centered and less mobile for easier phacofragmentation or removal by the cutting-suction probe. This technique was used in 10 eyes, including cases of traumatic dislocation and Marfan syndrome, with excellent anatomical results and no complications that could be attributed to the surgical technique. The technique has also been used to retrieve and reposition dislocated intraocular lenses.
