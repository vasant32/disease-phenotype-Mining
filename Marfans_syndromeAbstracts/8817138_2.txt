OBJECTIVE: The original Bentall procedure for the surgery of annulo-aortic ectasia (AAE) includes the risk of leakage and pseudo-aneurysm formation in the coronary anastomosis. To avoid the complications mentioned above we have used the open technique without the graft inclusion. In this study we evaluate our early and late results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with annuloaortic ectasia underwent surgical repair with composite graft between December 1975 and February 1994. In all cases the aneurysmal tissue was radically resected and the origins of the coronary arteries were directly reimplanted to the tube prosthesis. No wrapping was used. Twenty-two patients met the clinical criteria of Marfan syndrome. Thirteen of the patients underwent an emergency operation, because of a rupture of aneurysm in 2 cases and an acute dissection in 11 cases. Additional procedures were performed in 16 patients: mitral valve replacement in 2, coronary artery bypass grafting in 12 patients and in 2 cases the tube prosthesis included aortic arch, too. RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality was 3.0% (3/100). In the elective group there was one hospital death (1/87; 1.1%). In the emergency group two patients died in the operation room (2/13; 16.7%). There have been 13 late deaths among the 97 hospital survivors (13.4%). Four of the late deaths were surgery related. Routine control angiography was performed in all patients 6 months after surgery. Sixty patients who had lived at least 3 years after surgery were called to reangiography and 53 of them came. No pseudo-aneurysm or leakage at distal anastomosis or coronary anastomosis could be seen. A slight dilatation of one or both coronary origins was observed on 15 patients; 9 of whom had Marfan syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The open technique is simple and can be used in all anatomical variations of the annulo-aortic ectasia. The early and late results are at least comparable with those achieved by other techniques.
