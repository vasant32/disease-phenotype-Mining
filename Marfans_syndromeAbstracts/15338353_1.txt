We report a case of transaortic mitral valve repair combined with aortic root and arch replacement in a patient with Marfan's syndrome. Preoperative computed tomography and echocardiography showed acute aortic dissection (DeBakey type 1), severe aortic regurgitation, annuloaortic ectasia, and mild mitral regurgitation (MR). We performed artificial chordae implantation to the anterior mitral leaflet (AML) through the aortic root, followed by insertion of an aortic composite graft and replacement of the aortic arch. The patient is well 55 months after the operation, with minimal MR. We think that the transaortic approach is a good alternative for exposure and correction of the AML and its apparatus in special circumstances.
