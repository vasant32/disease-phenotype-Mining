A 34-year-old Marfan patient at the seventh week of pregnancy presented with acute type A aortic dissection and severe aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve and ascending aorta were replaced successfully using circulatory arrest and deep hypothermia. At 35 weeks of gestation, the patient underwent a cesarean section and delivered a healthy baby. To our knowledge, this case is the first to report a favorable fetal outcome following surgical repair of acute dissection in the first trimester of pregnancy.
