It was shown that pretreatment of human cells with interferons (IF) of different origin has an unequal protective effect under the action of various mutagens with different activity. The protective effect of IF was estimated using the test of sister chromatid exchanges. Natural leucocyte alpha IF is highly effective in healthy human cells and in those of patients having Marfan syndrome. The latter are characterised by disorder in DNA repair under the action of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), 8-methoxypsoralen and gamma-rays. Recombinant interferon (alpha 2) displayed no activity against gamma-rays in cells of healthy donors and patients with Marfan syndrome. Nor was it effective in the cells of patients in the experiments with 4-NQO. The absence of correlation between the ability of IF to protect the cells and their influence on the rate of cell proliferations was established.
