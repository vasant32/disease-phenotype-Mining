 BACKGROUND: A wide spectrum of operative techniques are applied in acute type A dissection. Most convey hospital mortality between 10% and 20%. In this high-risk setting, we believe that a conservative approach to the aortic root and the complete resection of the primary tear are important. We reviewed the results of this policy from our aortic surgery database. METHODS: Between 1988 and December 2000, 95 acute type A dissection patients were operated on by one surgeon. They included 70 men and 25 women aged 37 to 81 years (mean 65 years). Six had Marfan syndrome. Aortic root restoration or replacement was performed during cooling, open arch repair during circulatory arrest, and hemostasis while rewarming. Eighty-seven patients had ascending aortic replacement with glue resuspension of the valve. Two others had had aortic valve replacement previously. Aortic root and partial arch replacement was performed in 6 Marfan patients. Eighteen patients had hemiarch replacement, and 6 had total arch replacement to excise the tear. RESULTS: Five patients died in hospital (5.3% 30-day mortality) and another after early readmission for mediastinal infection (6.3% total mortality). There were no deaths from bleeding. Two patients required aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation 2.5 and 3.0 years postoperatively. Two others required total arch replacement and thromboexclusion procedures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our policy of primary tear excision and preservation of the native aortic valve has resulted in low overall mortality. We still prefer to replace the aortic root in dissected Marfan patients. In this high-risk condition, hospital survival is of paramount importance. A conservative "pathology-oriented" approach helps to achieve this aim.
