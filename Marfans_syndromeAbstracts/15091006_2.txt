Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) is a rare complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. We report two cases of HITT treated with the direct thrombin inhibitor Lepirudin. Immediate diagnosis was essential to prompt heparin discontinuation and successful early Lepirudin administration in the first case. In the second, the presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump delayed HITT recognition, and Lepirudin infusion could not prevent limb amputation. In both cases HITT occurred earlier (< 5 days after heparin exposure) than its usual presentation.
