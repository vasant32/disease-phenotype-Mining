PURPOSE: To describe the results of the removal of ectopic lenses from patients with Marfan's syndrome using the scleral fixation method. METHODS: Intraocular lenses (IOLs) were implanted in six eyes affected by lens dislocation (ectopia lentis) using either the scleral fixation method (five eyes) or a silicone IOL in the capsular bag (one eye). Mean patient age ranged from 8-11 years and follow-up ranged from 7-20 months. RESULTS: Functional success was obtained in all eyes. Postoperative visual acuity was 20/20 to 20/40. One patient showed a dislocation of the IOL in the anterior chamber. In three eyes, an opacification of the posterior capsule was treated using an Nd:YAG laser. CONCLUSION: Intraocular lens implantation using the scleral fixation technique is the first choice in patients with Marfan's syndrome because it reduces the complications of IOL decentration.
