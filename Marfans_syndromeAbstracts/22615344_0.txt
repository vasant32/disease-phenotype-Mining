 BACKGROUND: Patent false lumen in aortic dissection has been associated with poor prognosis. We aimed to assess the natural evolution of this condition and predictive factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four consecutive patients, 108 surgically treated type A and 76 medically treated type B, were discharged after an acute aortic dissection with patent false lumen. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed before discharge, and computed tomography was performed at 3 months and yearly thereafter. Median follow-up was 6.42 years (quartile 1 to quartile 3: 3.31-10.49). Forty-nine patients died during follow-up (22 type A, 27 type B), 31 suddenly. Surgical or endovascular treatment was indicated in 10 type A and 25 type B cases. Survival free from sudden death and surgical-endovascular treatment was 0.90, 0.81, and 0.46 (95% CI, 0.36-0.55) at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified baseline maximum descending aorta diameter (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.32 [1.10-1.59]; P=0.003), proximal location (HR: 1.84 [1.06-3.19]; P=0.03), and entry tear size (HR: 1.13 [1.08-1.2]; P<0.001) as predictors of dissection-related adverse events, whereas mortality was predicted by baseline maximum descending aorta diameter (HR: 1.36 [1.08-1.70]; P=0.008), entry tear size (HR: 1.1 [1.04-1.16]; P=0.001), and Marfan syndrome (HR: 3.66 [1.65-8.13]; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aortic dissection with persistent patent false lumen carries a high risk of complications. In addition to Marfan syndrome and aorta diameter, a large entry tear located in the proximal part of the dissection identifies a high-risk subgroup of patients who may benefit from earlier and more aggressive therapy.
