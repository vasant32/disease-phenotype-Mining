One hundred and nine cases of aortic aneurysm or dissection at the Cardiovascular Center of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, during the period of 18 August 1992 to 30 September 1997, were reviewed. Twenty seven cases had aortic dissection, fourteen type A and eight type B, and five were abdominal. One hundred and seven cases were operated on, eighty electively and twenty seven as an emergency; two patients refused surgery. As expected, all patients with dissection were symptomatic whereas of the others forty four were asymptomatic and thirty eight were symptomatic. There were twelve deaths, nine due to hemorrhage and one each due to cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmia. Most of the deaths occurred in patients who had sustained an aortic dissection.
