We report the case of a 16-year-old boy with Marfan syndrome who presented in severe congestive heart failure secondary to rupture of an aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva into the right atrium, a condition that was aggravated by coarctation of the aorta. The patient also had a large aneurysm of the ascending aorta with the characteristics of annuloaortic ectasia. The patient underwent successful surgical correction and is asymptomatic 3 years after the repair.
