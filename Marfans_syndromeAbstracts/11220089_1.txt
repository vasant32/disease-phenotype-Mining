Within the next few years the "book of life" will be written, i.e., the sequence of the human genome will be completely assembled. This knowledge will open new avenues for the understanding and treatment of diseases. Causal relationships between mutated genes and disease states have been established for a number of single gene disorders. Although molecular genetic tests are not yet feasible for routine clinical practice in most cases, faster and, eventually, less expensive technologies for the identification of mutations are on the horizon. Clinical guidelines also apply to molecular genetics with diagnostics test being performed only in those individuals who may benefit from it.
