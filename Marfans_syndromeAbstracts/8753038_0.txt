A case of bilateral pneumothorax in the patient with Marfan Syndrome was reported 13-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with diagnosis of left pneumothorax. He was tall and thin with long tapered extremities and echography revealed annulo-aortic-ectasia. A diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome was established by these characteristic of skeletal and cardiovascular findings. Air leakage continued inspite of the drainage of left chest cavity. Therefore, the resection of bullae was surgically undertaken. Post-operative course was uneventful and he discharged on 18th post-operative day. The pneumothorax of the right side occurred six months after first operation. After chest drainage, the surgical treatment was performed. However, he had recurrence of right pneumothorax six months after second operation. He was treated successfully with drainage tube and minocycline injection into the right pleural cavity. He should be carefully followed up, because the patient of Marfan Syndrome often dies due to cardiovascular abnormalities.
