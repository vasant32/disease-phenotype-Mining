Mitral valve repair has become an established treatment in adults, but there is limited experience with the procedure in children, in whom the avoidance of a valve prosthesis is particularly advantageous. Repair of the mitral valve in children who have Marfan syndrome is especially difficult due to the presence of generalized connective tissue disorder, which may lead to future elongation and rupture of chordae tendineae that were unaffected at the time of mitral valve repair. We performed a total augmentation of all segments of the mitral valve, using artificial chordae tendineae. Herein, we describe the procedure and the positive outcome in a 10-year-old girl.
