One stage operation was successfully performed on a 32-year-old man with annulo-aortic ectasia (AAE) and pectus excavatum caused by Marfan's syndrome. In the Bentall's operation for AAE, median sternotomy is usually carried out. In this case it was difficult to obtain a favorable viewing field due to an extremely deformed sternum and significant displacement of the heart into the left thoracic cavity. By removing the sternum en bloc, as a cost-sterno complex, the surgery was performed safely with an excellent operative field. In this surgery combined with the sternal turnover, the amount of intra and post operative bleeding was the same as occurs in other open heart surgeries.
