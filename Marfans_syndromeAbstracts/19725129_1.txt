Here we report on a patient with multiple lentigines, hypertelorism, short stature, arachnodactyly, scoliosis, dissecting aneurysm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developmental delay, and a family history of Marfan syndrome. The patient is affected with both Marfan and LEOPARD syndromes. Mutational screening of the FBN1 gene showed a c.1464T>A (p.C488X) mutation and screening of the PTPN11 gene showed a c.836A>G (p.Y279C) mutation. We conclude that each mutation contributed independently to individual features in the ocular and cardiovascular systems, although short stature was more significantly influenced by the p.Y279C change in PTPN11 rather than the mutation in FBN1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mutations in both FBN1 and PTPN11 with combined phenotypes of Marfan and LEOPARD syndromes.
