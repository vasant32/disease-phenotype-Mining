In Marfan syndrome, there is a subset, called infantile Marfan syndrome, in which the disease is diagnosed during infancy and cardiac lesions including mitral regurgitation and aortic root dilatation tend to be deteriorated rapidly. In infantile Marfan syndrome, respiratory function is sometimes impaired when skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and pectus excavatum are severe. In this report, we describe a 2-year and 4-months old boy with infantile Marfan syndrome who presented with severe mitral regurgitation and the collapsed left lung. In addition to the impairment of respiratory function due to severe scoliosis, the left lung was collapsed because of the compression of the left bronchus by the enlarged left atrium. The patient required mitral valve replacement concomitantly with left atrial plication, resulting in the decompression of the left bronchus and the re-expansion of the left lung. Characteristics and surgical management of infantile Marfan syndrome are discussed in this report.
