A genetic follow-up study has been performed of 64 infants who were diagnosed as having Pierre Robin complex over a 23-year period in South Australia. Patients and their families were contacted, family history was obtained, and physical examinations were performed with an aim to detect heterogeneity and establish recurrence risks. In 16 deceased patients, detailed autopsy reports allowed the conclusion that 12 (70%) had an underlying syndrome. Twelve of the 47 living patients (26%) were diagnosed as having an underlying syndrome, the most common of which was Stickler syndrome (6 cases). In most cases separation of syndromic cases from the nonsyndromic cases was possible in the neonatal period. In the 34 patients without an underlying syndrome, study of pregnancy and birth details did not reveal any distinctive etiologic factors. There was no recurrence in sibs of this group of patients with nonsyndromic Pierre Robin complex.
