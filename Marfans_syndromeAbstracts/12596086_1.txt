 PRINCIPLES: Endoluminal stent-grafts are emerging as a less invasive alternative to conventional open surgery in the management of descending thoracic aortic dissections and aneurysms. We describe our experience with endovascular stent-grafting in the treatment of thoracic aorta pathology. METHODS: 17 Patients were treated with 23 endovascular stents. The underlying pathology was an atherosclerotic aneurysm verum (n = 5), a type B dissection with contained rupture (n = 3), an intramural haematoma with contained rupture (n = 1) and a false aneurysm of unknown origin (n = 1). One patient had Marfan's syndrome and six patients had a traumatic rupture of the descending aorta. RESULTS: Overall 23 stent-grafts were implanted. In one patient, conversion to an open graft replacement of the descending aorta was necessary. One patient died. In four patients (23.5%) a left carotid-subclavia bypass or transposition was performed to achieve a sufficient neck for the proximal stent-graft landing zone. The postoperative control-CT scans revealed a total of six endoleaks (EL) (four type I, one type II and one type IV). Two patients needed a graft extension in a second operation (4 days and 18 month after the first operation), two EL (one type I and one type II) disappeared after 9 and 18 months, respectively and two EL are still under observation. One patient developed a paresis after conversion to open graft replacement. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of diseases of the descending aorta can be treated by endoluminal stent-grafting, which seems to be a valid alternative to open repair in well selected cases. Mortality and morbidity in our small series were low. Continuous follow-up is mandatory.
