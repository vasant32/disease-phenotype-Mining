The faster scanning speed of 256-slice computed tomographic scanners has enabled electrocardiographic-gated imaging of the entire thoraco-abdominal aorta in several seconds. Electrocardiographic-gated acquisition allows for image reconstruction in any desired phase of the cardiac cycle, as well as dynamic assessment by looping the different reconstruction phases. We describe the application of 256-slice computed tomography in a patient with Marfan syndrome and acute type A aortic dissection. A comprehensive static and dynamic aorto-cardiac analysis was performed from a single scan, including the aortic dissection, aortic valve prosthesis, and coronary arteries.
