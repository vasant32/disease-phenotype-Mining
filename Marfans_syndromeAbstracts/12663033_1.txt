A 13-year-old boy with Marfan's syndrome presented with bilateral, acute, complete anterior dislocation of the crystalline lens. The lens substance was aspirated intracapsularly after 2 linear capsulotomies were created. The empty capsular bag was removed from the eye as a vitrectome was used to severe the adhesions between the capsule and vitreous face through 1 paracentesis and a forceps was used to pull the capsule through the other paracentesis. Aphakia was corrected by glasses and contact lenses. Two years after surgery, the best corrected visual acuity was 20/32 in both eyes.
