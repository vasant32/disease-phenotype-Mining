 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of the established distinction between classic and non-classic forms of mitral valve prolapsed (MVP). METHODS: We included in this prospective study all patients examined in our preventive cardiology outpatient clinics during the biannual period October 2004-October 2006. We examined in total 10.818 patients, 238 of whom (2.2%) were diagnosed for MVP. We noted relevant demographic and clinical data (gender, age of diagnosis, symptoms, need for hospitalization) and performed statistical comparisons between patients with the classic and those with the non-classic form. Follow-up controls were performed three years afterwards. RESULTS: Patients with the classic form had an earlier age of first diagnosis, more prominent symptoms, and more frequently diagnosis for other disorders (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) than the rest of the patients; however, there were no significant differences as far as certain major complications (stroke, death, submission to surgery) were concerned. CONCLUSION: The classic form of mitral valve prolapse is more tightly associated with morbid complications, and a more frequent follow-up control in this group of patients may be useful.
