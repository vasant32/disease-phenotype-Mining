A 39 year old man with Marfan syndrome presented with multiple pulmonary emboli and renal, hepatic, and splenic infarcts of unknown aetiology. The combination of thromboemboli and physical features initially suggested homocystinuria; however, laboratory examination showed no evidence for this disorder. Laboratory evaluation identified no coagulation abnormalities. This patient represents the unusual occurrence of hypercoagulability in a patient with Marfan syndrome.
