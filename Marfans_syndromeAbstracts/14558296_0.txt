 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the early and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing a Bentall procedure or its button modification for chronic aortic aneurysms with aortic valve incompetence. METHODS: Between January 1986 and January 2002, 65 patients (84% males, mean age 58.9 +/- 11 years) underwent aortic root replacement with a Bentall or a button-Bentall operation. Annuloaortic ectasia was the most frequent cause of aortic disease in this series (n = 37, 56.9%), followed by atherosclerotic aneurysms (n = 22, 33.9%), and post-stenotic dilation (n = 5, 7.7%). One patient (1.5%) underwent redo aortic root replacement,3 (4.6%) had a Marfan syndrome, and 6 (9.2%) underwent a concomitant replacement of the aortic arch. The duration of follow-up ranged from 2 to 192 months (mean 89.6 +/- 21.8 months). RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 0%. Early non-fatal complications comprised: bleeding requiring surgical re-exploration (n = 1, 1.5%), low output syndrome (n = 1, 1.5%), acute renal insufficiency (n = 1, 1.5%), transient ischemic attack (n = 2, 3.1%), stroke (n = 1, 1.5%), and pulmonary insufficiency (n = 1, 1.5%). There was a late death due to a pulmonary neoplasm. The 16-year actuarial survival was 97 +/- 2% (hazard 0.02 +/- 0.02). No patient required reoperation. Furthermore, the long-term clinical follow-up was characterized by the complete absence of endocarditis, anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, valve thrombosis, and prosthetic failure. Finally, the NYHA functional status was significantly improved (1.1 +/- 0.50, p < 0.001 vs preoperatively). CONCLUSIONS: The late results of the Bentall and button-Bentall procedures were excellent. Our findings confirm that these techniques still constitute the gold standard in the surgical treatment of combined valve and ascending aorta pathologies.
