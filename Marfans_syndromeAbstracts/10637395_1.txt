We report a 12-year-old girl with Sprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) who was complicated with annuloaortic ectasia with aortic regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation, and a severe pectus excavatum. In this patient, aortic root replacement, mitral valve replacement, and sternal elevation were simultaneously performed, and a version of Ravitch's procedure that was technically modified to support the sternum was used for sternal elevation. This modified sternal elevation technique gave excellent operative exposure, and maintained chest wall stability after the operation.
