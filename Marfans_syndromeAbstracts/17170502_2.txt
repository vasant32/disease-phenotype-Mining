A 24-year-old pregnant woman with Marfan's syndrome delivered by cesarean section during the 38th week of gestation. Although aortic root dilatation did not increase during pregnancy, three months after delivery, the patient noticed a pulsatile abdominal mass. Aortic aneurysm was diagnosed and surgical replacement of the infrarenal abdominal aorta to the common iliac arteries and reconstruction of the inferior mesenteric artery were performed. Moreover, the patient subsequently developed a Stanford type B thoracic aortic dissection, even after more than four months of beta-blockade.
