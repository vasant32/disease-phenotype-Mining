We report on an infant with a karyotype of 46,XY,del(2) (p11.2p13), the fourth reported case in the literature. At birth, the child had eventration of the diaphragm. His phenotype was suggestive of a connective tissue disorder with scoliosis, pectus carinatum, long slender fingers, camptodactyly, cryptorchidism, hypertonia and myopia. His facial appearance was mildly dysmorphic and strongly resembled a previously reported patient with the same deletion. The child expired at 2 months of age. Some generalizations can be made about the phenotype for del(2)(p11.2p13), despite reporting of cases at different ages.
