A 51-year-old male of Marfan syndrome with annuloarotic ectasia underwent the Bentall operation. One and a half months later, he suddenly fell into the left ventricular failure associated with lung edema. Echocardiogram revealed total occlusion of the graft and aortic valve detachment was suspected. An emergency operation was performed. The aortic valve was completely detached due to infectious endocarditis. As anastomosed portions of the proximal coronary arteries and distal aorta were intact, these rims of the old graft were reserved. A new composite graft was anastomosed distally to the above reserved graft rims and sutured proximally to the trimmed aortic valvular ring. The patient survived the re-operation despite many post-operative complications such as mediastinitis, colon bleeding, renal failure and severe hepatic dysfunction.
