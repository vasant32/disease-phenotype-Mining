Larsen syndrome is characterized by multiple congenital joint dislocations and a characteristic flattened facial appearance. The aetiology is unknown, but the syndrome is considered a probable connective tissue disorder and the cardiovascular manifestations are similar to those of Marfan syndrome. We describe an 8-year-old girl with the characteristic features of Larsen syndrome who was also affected by a saccular aneurysm of the descending aorta, just distal to the left subclavian artery. We present the radiological findings and review the literature.
