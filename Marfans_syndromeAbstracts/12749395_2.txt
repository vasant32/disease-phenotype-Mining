OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a simple axial spin echo (SE) image can be used for reliable assessment of pulmonary artery dimensions in patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Fifty Marfan patients (mean age 33 +/- 10 years; 34 men, 16 women) and 15 normal subjects (mean age 28 +/- 4 years; nine men, six women) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pulmonary artery dimensions were obtained on axial SE images at two different levels: (1) the level of the pulmonary artery root, and (2) the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation. To evaluate the accuracy of axial plane measurements 10 Marfan patients also underwent contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA). RESULTS: In the 10 Marfan patients who also underwent CE-MRA, the mean diameter at the pulmonary bifurcation assessed with CE-MRA (31.5 +/- 3.6 mm) was almost equal to mean diameter assessed with axial SE (30.7 +/- 3.6 mm). Agreement of methodology according to Bland and Altman analysis showed a 95% confidence interval ranging from -2.6 to + 4.4 mm for all distances of the pulmonary artery root. In Marfan patients the mean right-left diameter measured on both axial SE images and CE-MRA was approximately 2.5 mm larger than the anterior-right and anterior-left diameters (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Axial SE MRI is a reliable and easy acquisition to measure pulmonary artery dimensions in patients with Marfan syndrome, and could be used for follow-up, especially in patients with severe involvement of the cardiovascular system. Not only the pulmonary artery trunk but also the asymmetric pulmonary root should be measured, although the clinical relevance of the asymmetric root is not yet known.
