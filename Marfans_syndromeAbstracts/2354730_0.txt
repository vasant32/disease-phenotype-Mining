A case of iliac artery aneurysm in a young male patient with Marfan's Syndrome is described. The aneurysm was managed by a simple exclusion technique. The occurrence of such an aneurysm suggests that the inherent mural weakness in the syndrome is more widespread in the arterial tree than is generally appreciated. The association of iliac artery aneurysm and Marfan's Syndrome does not seem to have been previously reported.
