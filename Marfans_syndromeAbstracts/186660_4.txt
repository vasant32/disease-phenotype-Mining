Ultrastructural study of prolapsed atrioventricular valves from five patients, one of whom also had the Marfan syndrome, disclosed granular cells that were characterized by numerous membrane-bound, electron-dense inclusions resembling those in the Hurler syndrome. Collagen fibrils were present within some of these inclusions. The intracellular collagen deposits may form as a consequence of abnormal interactions between newly secreted collagen and acid mucopolysaccharides.
