Acute aortic dissection type-A (AADA) is a life-threatening condition especially in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) simultaneously suffering from severe pectus excavatum (PE). We report on emergency surgery for combined treatment of PE and AADA in a patient with MFS using an alternative approach. It leads to excellent exposure of the dislocated heart and great vessels enabling Bentall procedure followed by funnel chest repair with modified technique of Adkins and Blades. We achieved favorable functional and cosmetic results. Therefore, we conclude the surgical approach presented is feasible for standard treatment of AADA and consecutive repair of PE.
