Marfan's syndrome is a rare hereditary disease of connective tissue, the surgical interest of which is in its propensity to the development of arterial aneurysms. We describe the case of a 40-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital because of thrombosis of the right common iliac artery and who was treated with a new technique: thromboendarterectomy of the right common iliac artery and covering of the artery with a synthetic graft, in order to avoid the risk of developing an aneurysm of the endarterectomised iliac artery. This is a new technique, here described for the first time in the international literature.
