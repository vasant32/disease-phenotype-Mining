Graft replacement was performed in a 29-year-old man for an abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with Marfan's syndrome. Since the dissecting aortic aneurysm (DeBakey type II) accompanied by disruption of the right coronary artery developed 74 days after operation, the emergency Bentall's operation was successfully carried out with bypassing of the right coronary artery using a saphenous vein graft. Fifteen Japanese cases operated on for abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with Marfan's syndrome are reviewed, and the problems concerning surgery of abdominal aortic aneurysm and Bentall's operation are discussed.
