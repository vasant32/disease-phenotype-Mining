Marfan syndrome is a clinically and allelic heterogeneous, heritable connective tissue disorder with infrequently reported neuromuscular features. This study is the first to delineate these symptoms in a non-selected population. Neuromuscular involvement was evaluated in 10 Marfan patients through a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nerve conduction study (NCS), needle electromyography (EMG), muscle ultrasound, laboratory investigation, and muscle biopsy. Existing neuroimages were screened for dural ectasia and spinal meningeal cysts. Twenty healthy controls with similar age distribution completed the questionnaire. The results showed that various neuromuscular symptoms occur more frequently in the patients. Four older patients reported muscle weakness, five patients had a mild-to-moderate reduction in vibration sense, and all older patients mentioned mild functional impairments. NCS showed axonal polyneuropathy in four and EMG myopathic and neurogenic changes in all patients. Increased echo intensity and atrophy on muscle ultrasound was found in more than half of the patients. Muscle biopsies obtained in two patients showed myopathic changes in the older, female patient. In conclusion, the majority of Marfan patients exhibited neuromuscular symptoms characterized as myopathy or polyneuropathy or both, and signs of lumbosacral radiculopathy, with symptoms being most pronounced in the older patients. Although meriting corroboration, these findings indicate a need to further the awareness of neuromuscular involvement in this population.
