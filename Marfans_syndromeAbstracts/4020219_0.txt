The present investigation was undertaken to develop a standard method of recording the bone measurements of the normal hand for use in comparative studies of genetic abnormalities of the skeletal system affecting the hand. The data for this study are obtained from the radiographs of the hands of normal 461 males and 565 females aged from 20 to 84 years. Measurements of length and width of all the phalanges and metacarpals are recorded. The phalangeal index and metacarpal index of each bone are obtained by dividing the length by the width. Frequencies of brachymesophalangy of the little finger and brachytelephalangy of the thumb are investigated. There are no significant differences between the bone of the right and left hand related to hand dominance. The radiographs of the hands of mother and son with the Marfan syndrome were compared with normal one. Metacarpal index and phalangeal index are useful for diagnosis of the Marfan syndrome.
