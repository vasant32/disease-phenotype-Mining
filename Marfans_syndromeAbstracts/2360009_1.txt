In a 40-year-old man who collapsed after sporting activity and died shortly after in spite of surgery, autopsy revealed a small ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the left common iliac artery. At the site of rupture, in the aorta and in multiple visceral arteries extensive mucoid degeneration of the media was found. Additional findings (bone deformities, bullous emphysema of the apices of both lungs, and familial affliction) made it possible to establish the diagnosis of an oligosymptomatic form of Marfan syndrome.
