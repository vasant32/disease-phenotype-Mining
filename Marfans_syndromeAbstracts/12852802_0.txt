Recent reports support the role of a valve-sparing procedure in ascending aortic dissection in patients with Marfans syndrome. A 49-year-old woman with Marfans syndrome and prior aortic aneurysm repaired with a composite graft presented with sudden-onset chest pain. Following an initial negative computed tomographic (CT) scan, a long dissection involving the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta was discovered on a repeat CT scan a few hours later. Symptoms improved gradually with optimal medical management and the patient was discharged home on anticoagulant therapy. Although no direct cause-and-effect relationship can be established, chronic anticoagulant therapy may accelerate the progression of recurrent dissection in these patients. A valve-sparing procedure should be considered in eligible patients with Marfans syndrome who need operative correction to avoid possible future untoward effects of long-term anticoagulant therapy.
