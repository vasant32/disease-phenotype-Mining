Authors present two patients suffering from Marfan syndrome. Asymptomatically developed serious cardiovascular complications being characteristic of the syndrome itself were revealed at both cases. Type "A" aortic dissection was found at the first, and type "B" aortic dissection involving even the arch as well revealed at the other patient. They were operated on an elective base. Total proximal aortic reconstructions (aortic root-ascending aorta-arch) were performed under deep hypothermia using total circulatory arrest (35 and 87 min). Both patients are doing well without complaints 3-4 months following the surgical interventions. Control angiographic imagination has found normal anatomic conditions at one of the patients. Anastomosis stenosis at the borderline of the arch and descending aorta was revealed at the other case which should be necessary to operate at an later occasion.
