From 1984 to 1997, 112 patients have been operated at the Department of Cardiac Surgery of the Azienda Ospedaliera of Parma for acute dissection of ascending aorta. They were 73 males and 39 females of mean age 59.2 years (range 19-79); in the majority they presented a history of essential hypertension and atherosclerotic disease: the first diagnostic suspicion has been confirmed either by angio-CT scan or by CT scan plus aorthography and, from 1994, with transesophageal color doppler echocardiography that is becoming a valuable and precise tool wich can be used in emergency room. Bentall type composite repair or modified Bentall technique has been possible in 37 patients, while in the remaning 75, surgical aortic repair has been achieved by interposition of a dacron vascular prosthesis. Cardiac procedures that were performed in addition were coronary bypass grafthing, resuspension of the aortic valve, AVR. Total arch replacement with reimplantation of brachiocephalic vessels were performed in 6 patients and partial in 10, when intimal tear extended into the arc. Thirthythree in hospital deaths (29.4%) occurred (15 in S.O. and 18 in UCI). Follow up of the hospital survivors was conducted at a mean postoperative interval of 55 months (range 2 to 149 months with 6 late death related to aortic dissection). Our experience shows an increased incidence hypertension and aortic atherosclerosis, compared with marfan's syndrome as a source of acute aortic dissection in the late years, transesophageal echocardiography is a excellent tool for aortic dissection but it may miss dissection localized in other aortic portion, the need of an individualized and conservative surgical approach tailored to the pathology encountered.
