The absence of sinuses of Valsalva is postulated to perturb coronary flow patterns and to create abnormal leaflet stresses, which theoretically may limit the long-term durability of valve-sparing aortic root replacement with the original Tirone David-I reimplantation technique with a cylindrical tube graft. David developed the "T. David-V" procedure in 2001; it creates large billowing Dacron pseudosinuses while retaining the reimplantation concept. To illustrate a simple modification of the T. David-V technique, we describe a patient with Marfan's syndrome who underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement with 1 large and 1 small graft to create pseudosinuses in the Dacron graft, to facilitate suturing the valve inside the graft, and to make the distal graft-to-aorta anastomosis a better size match.
