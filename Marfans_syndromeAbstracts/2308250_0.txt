A 17-year-old male patient with Marfan syndrome was admitted due to recurrent bilateral pneumothorax which had recurred totally 11 times during the past 3 years. For the treatment of obstinately continuing right pneumothorax resection of bullae in combination with pleuropexy using OK 432 was effective. Two months thereafter Bentall operation with a composite graft consisting of a woven Dacron tube and a Bj√∂rk-Shiley 27 mm aortic valve prosthesis was performed for his anuloartic ectasia. Left pneumothorax recurred 2 weeks after Bentall operation. But it was treated successfully with OK 432 injection into the left pleural cavity. Now, he is doing well as a student.
