 AIM: The aim of this report is to summarize our experience with the Tirone David I technique over a 4-year period. METHODS: Since 1997 15 patients were operated on using this surgical procedure. Of the patients, nine were male (60%) and six (40%) female. Ages ranged from 23 to 75 years (mean 62.1+/-17.2 years). The underlying disease was chronic aneurysm of the ascending aorta or root in 13 (86.6%) and chronic dissection in two (13.4%). Four patients (26.6%) had skeletal manifestations of Marfan's syndrome. Additional cardiac procedures were performed in two patients (13.4%). Mean follow-up time was 26.6+/-11.2 months (range 7-50 months). RESULTS: There were no early deaths. Postoperative non-fatal complications occurred in two (13.3%) patients. There was no valve-related late death occurring 6 months after operation. Actuarial survival was 0.94+/-0.07 at 4 years; 4-year freedom from reoperation was 0.91+/-0.07. The probability of needing reoperation was 8+/-0.9%. There were no instances of infective endocarditis or thromboembolic complications. At the end of the follow-up period, trivial or no aortic regurgitation was demonstrated in 57.1%, mild in 42.9% and no patient had an insufficiency graded >/=moderate. Echocardiography showed early postoperative reduction in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, which was maintained at follow-up controls. CONCLUSIONS: The Tirone David I procedure showed good early results, which encourage further use of this type of repair. However, further larger studies and long-term results are necessary for a definite judgment on this operative method.
