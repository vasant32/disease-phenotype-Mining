To evaluate the ocular complications of Marfan's syndrome which cause severe visual disturbance, we retrospectively investigated 104 patients (208 eyes) with Marfan's syndrome. Dislocation of the lens, the most frequent ocular manifestation, was detected in 151 eyes (72.6%). There were 33 eyes with a visual acuity 0.1 or less. In this group, we found retinal detachment in 12 eyes (36.4%) and glaucoma in 5 eyes (15.2%) as the causes of visual disturbance. Among 17 eyes with retinal detachment, 5 eyes (29.4%) had horizontally dislocated lens. On the other hand. The lens dislocation in a downward direction was found in 5 (22.7%) of 22 eyes with glaucoma. No lens dislocation in an upward direction was found in eyes with glaucoma. The incidence of retinal detachment in aphakic eyes (5/31, 16.1%) was higher than that in the phakic group (16/177, 9.0%). In only 2 (3.6%) of 56 eyes, did the lens dislocation become markedly worse during the observation period. From these data, we re-confirmed that retinal detachment and glaucoma are the most important ocular complications of Marfan's syndrome leading to severe visual disturbance. The decision to operate on the dislocated lens should be made cautiously.
