A 57-year-old man with manifestations of Marfan syndrome was referred for detail examination of cardiac murmur to our hospital. Cardioangiography showed moderate aortic valve regurgitation (2/4), and severe mitral valve regurgitation (3/4), in addition to aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root. Moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation (2/4) was also detected by Doppler echocardiography. Aortic root replacement with the Cabrol technique, mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude Medical valve, and repair of the tricuspid valve with the bicuspidalization technique were simultaneously performed in this patient. His postoperative recovery was uneventful. In this study, we discuss about the indications of simultaneous aortic root replacement and mitral valve replacement in a patient with Marfan syndrome.
