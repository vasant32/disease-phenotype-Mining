On the basis of the clinical material of 319 individuals suffering from spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis the authors examined the current occurrence of scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. After eliminating the curves up to 20 degrees and all disruptions of isthmus without slide they found only 18 patients. The slide was on the average 35 per cent (8 per cent to 100 per cent), scoliotic curve 35 degrees (21-71 degrees). The scoliotic curve was idiopathic in 13 cases and once it occurred in case of Marfan syndrome. Only 2 curves were of spastic and 2 of olisthetic type with the maximum of 41 degrees. The analysis has shown that in the selection of more pronounced deformities the number substantially falls of spastic and olisthetic scolioses which are mostly very slight and there prevail idiopathic curves. Operation was performed in one case of idiopathic curve and in one case of Marfan syndrome and in 3 patients suffering from spondylolisthesis.
