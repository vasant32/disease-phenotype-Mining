PURPOSE: Bilateral retinal detachment (RD) in Marfan's syndrome (MS) has a typical preoperative, operative, and post-operative course. This study describes symmetry of retinal tears and bilateral RD surgery in five MS patients over a period of 15 years. METHODS: Six eyes with uncomplicated RD were operated on using the scleral buckling procedure, and four eyes with complicated RD were operated using a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and inner retinal tamponade with silicon oil. RESULTS: Complete retinal reattachment was achieved in seven eyes. Partial anatomical success with attached macula was achieved in one eye. The surgery failed in two eyes. Final visual acuity was between 0.66 and 0.33 in three eyes, and between 0.25 and 0.1 in five; two eyes had no light perception. CONCLUSIONS: The course of the bilateral retinal disease highly correlated with the symmetry of retinal defects.
