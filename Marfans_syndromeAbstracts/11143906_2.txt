Marfan syndrome is the second most common inherited connective tissue disorder after osteogenesis imperfecta. Musculoskeletal abnormalities are at the forefront of the clinical picture and count among the major diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome, together with cardiovascular and ocular system involvement. Early diagnosis is of the utmost importance since preventive measures significantly increase life expectancy and prevent the occurrence of impairments and disabilities. Marfan syndrome is due to mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene, which is the main protein of the microfibril network. Microfibrils play a crucial role in the trophicity and function of elastic tissue. Multidisciplinary management of the patients and their families is vital.
