Between February 1986 and April 1992, 27 patients ranging in age from 8 to 65 years (median, 18 years) underwent allograft replacement of the aortic valve with one death (operative mortality, 3.7%). The indications for operation were aortic regurgitation in 14 patients, aortic stenosis in 7, aortic stenosis/regurgitation in 4, and endocarditis in 2. Associated lesions included annuloectasia in 4 patients (1 with Marfan's syndrome), sinus of Valsalva aneurysm in 3, coronary artery disease in 4, and ventricular septal defect in 2. The freehand technique was used in 12 patients and the miniroot replacement in 15 patients. The postoperative transvalvular gradient was 17 mm Hg in freehand valves and 7 mm Hg in the miniroot valves. Initial postoperative study showed no or trivial aortic regurgitation in all 26 survivors except 1 freehand patient who had mild aortic regurgitation. At late study up to 6 years postoperatively all 10 of our available freehand patients showed progressive regurgitation, and it was severe in 4 patients. By contrast only half of the miniroot patients showed progressive regurgitation, and in none was it severe. Allograft replacement of the aortic valve can be done in children and adults with low mortality rate, short hospital stay, and excellent early function. Subsequent follow-up studies suggest that the miniroot replacements are superior to the freehand valves with lower transvalvular gradients, less valvular regurgitation, and delayed progression of valvular regurgitation.
