Marfan's syndrome in its complete and incomplete forms takes very often a course with cardiac complications, predetermining the fate of such patients. The incomplete forms often present difficulties for the timely etiological elucidation of the cardiac changes leading to a retardation in the prescribing a rational regime to the patients and timeliness of the operation treatment. The authors' team own observations are reported on 10 patients with Marfan's syndrome, one with complete form and nine--incomplete forms, all of them with cardiac complications; two with mitral insufficiency, three with aortic insufficiency, four with aortic and mitral insufficiency and one with aortic, mitral and tricuspidal insufficiency; seven of the patients had aneurysm at the initial part of the aorta, manifested to various degrees and one--dysplasia of aorta. Rhythm disturbances were found in one of the patients. One of the patients underwent operation--prosthesis of mitral and aortic valve--with good results. Three of them died of severe total cardiac insufficiency.
