 PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of a capsule anchor to reposition and fixate the capsular bag to the scleral wall in eyes with subluxation of the crystalline lens. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel. METHODS: This study evaluated a 1-plane poly(methyl methacrylate) intraocular implant (Capsular Anchor) that is clipped to the anterior capsule to support it. The device is composed of a central rod located in front of the anterior capsule and 2 lateral arms positioned behind the anterior capsule. The anchor is secured to the sclera with a single 9-0 or 10-0 polypropylene suture. A capsular tension ring (CTR) can be implanted in conjunction with the anchor. The anchor was implanted in eyes with subluxated cataractous lenses. After surgery, intraocular lens (IOL) centration and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were monitored for 12 months. RESULTS: The anchor was successfully implanted in 2 patients with traumatic subluxated lenses and 2 patients with Marfan syndrome. In 1 eye, 2 anchors were used because of zonular dehiscence that extended during surgery. In 3 eyes, an IOL was implanted in the bag and in 1 eye, in the sulcus. A CTR was additionally implanted in 3 eyes. During the 12-month follow-up, the IOLs remained well centered and stable. The CDVA improved to 20/20 to 20/25 in all cases. CONCLUSION: The capsule anchor was effective in fixating the lens capsule to the scleral wall in cases of significant zonular dehiscence.
