Aortic dissection is a common complication of Marfan's syndrome. We report such a patient who survived two separate dissections which both occurred shortly after uneventful pregnancies. The first dissection was a self-limiting DeBakey type III but the second commenced in the left common iliac artery and extended retrogradely into the lower abdominal aorta. This latter type of dissection does not appear to have been previously reported.
