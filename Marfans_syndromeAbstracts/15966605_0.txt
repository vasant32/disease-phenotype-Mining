Marfan's syndrome is a cause of dilatation of the aorta, the main complication of which is dissection of the aorta. 2D echocardiography is the reference investigation for measuring the ascending aorta. Asymmetry of sinus dilatation makes a 3D approach necessary. Real time 3D echocardiography is a simple, non-invasive method which, by a biplane mode, allows measurement of the 3 sinuses of Valsalva. The aim of the study was to compare the 2D and 3D echocardiographic methods for measuring the ascending aorta. Fifteen patients (average age 12 +/- 8 years) with Marfan's syndrome were studied prospectively. The maximal 3D diameter was significantly greater than the 2D measurement (31.7 +/- 6.8 mm vs 29.9 +/- 6.6 mm, p< 0.005). In 4 patients, the difference was over 3 mm. The diameter between the right coronary and left coronary sinus was greater than the two others (right coronary-non coronary and left coronary-non coronary). The oldest 5 patients had an MRI aortic measurement very similar to that of 3D echocardiography (36.6 vs 36.7 mm). Real time 3D echocardiography in the biplane mode enables reliable and reproducible measurement of the aortic root in patients with Marfan's syndrome. Larger and multicenter studies are required to allow confirmation of the value of 3D echocardiography in the follow-up of these patients.
