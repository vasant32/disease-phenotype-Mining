A 19-year-old school boy suffered from fluctuating uncharacteristic chest pain in the last 20 h before his death. He died unexpectedly within a few minutes of a hemopericardium, which resulted from an aneurysmal rupture of the ascending aorta. The patient's past history as well as the autopsy and ultrastructural findings led to the diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome with alterations of the cardiovascular skeletal system but no ophthalmological involvement ("oligosymptomatic" form of Marfan's syndrome). Appraisal of the cause of death is made more difficult by the fact that medical treatment was undertaken on the same day, whereby subtotal liver crushing was established that had resulted from attempts at resuscitation.
