 BACKGROUND: Composite valve graft replacement is currently the treatment of choice for a wide variety of lesions of the aortic root and the ascending aorta. In this study we report our experience with aortic root replacement using a composite graft. METHODS: Between October 1978 and May 2001, 274 patients (79.6% male and 20.4% female) with a mean age of 53.5 years underwent composite graft replacement of the aortic root. One hundred sixty-one patients (70.8%) had annuloaortic ectasia and 46 (16.8%) aortic dissection. The classic Bentall technique was used in 94 patients (34.3%), the "button technique" in 172 patients (62.8%), and the Cabrol technique in 8 patients (2.9%). RESULTS: The early mortality rate was 6.9% (19 of 274 patients). Cardiopulmonary bypass time longer than 180 minutes and associated coronary artery bypass grafting were found to be independent risk factors of early mortality. The actuarial survival rate was 77.7% at 5 years and 63% at 10 years. The independent risk factors for late mortality were coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, and postoperative dialysis. The actuarial freedom from reoperation on the remaining aorta was higher among patients without Marfan syndrome (94.6% versus 79.6% at 10 years, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Composite valve graft replacement can be performed with low hospital mortality and morbidity. The button technique offers some advantages and should be used whenever possible. In case of acute aortic dissection root replacement is usually not necessary. Marfan patients should be treated with early root replacement before dissection occurs.
