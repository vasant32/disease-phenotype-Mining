The authors describe two brothers with Marfan syndrome who developed severe complications after iris-suture fixation of an intraocular lens (IOL). A secondary iris cyst developed in one and the IOL dislocated into the vitreous in the other, requiring pars plana vitrectomy and IOL removal. Although the visual outcome was good in both cases, severe complications of iris-suture fixated IOLs must be considered when surgical correction of aphakia is attempted in children with Marfan syndrome.
