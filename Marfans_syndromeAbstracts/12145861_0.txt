Retrospective analysis of the treatment results was done in 115 patients with Marphan's syndrome, operated on for the ascending aorta aneurysm. In 100 patients the complete replacement of ascending aorta and aortal valve was performed, using valvecontaining conduit with reimplantation of coronary arteries ostium into vascular prostheses (operation according to Bentalla--De Bono), in 62 of them--in our modification; in 6--the aortal valve prosthesis and aneurysmorrhaphy, in 7--the aortal valve prosthesis and aneurysmal resection with external enveloping of ascending aorta using vascular prosthesis (Robicsek operation); in 2--the valvepreserving operation on aortal valve with replacement of ascending aorta using vascular prosthesis. General mortality in hospital was 13%, including that after aneurysmorrhaphy--50%, the Robicsek operation--14.3%, Bentala--De Bono--11%. Late results (in terms from 1 year to 17.5 years) were studied up in 84 patients. The author considers Bentalla--De Bono operation the method of choice for the ascending aorta aneurysm in patients with Marphan's syndrome. The introduction of modification, proposed by him, promotes prophylaxis of the bleeding occurrence in immediate postoperative period.
