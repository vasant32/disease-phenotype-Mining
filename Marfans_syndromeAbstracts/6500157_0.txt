A case history of a pregnant patient with the Marfan syndrome is presented. During pregnancy regular echocardiographic examinations were performed, showing a slight increase in the aortic root diameter 1 month after delivery. The hydroxyproline content of the amniotic fluid appeared to be significantly elevated; however, the baby did not seem to be affected by the Marfan syndrome. After delivery we noted a recto-vaginal perforation, which has not been described in deliveries of Marfan patients before. Pregnancy in a Marfan patient is a hazardous situation, with a 10-40% fatal outcome according to the literature. Regular echocardiographic control is necessary to evaluate the cardiac risk.
