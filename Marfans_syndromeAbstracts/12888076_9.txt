 PURPOSE: To evaluate factors related to late-onset transscleral sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens (TSIOL) subluxation. METHODS: Retrospective observational case series. Analysis of subluxated TSIOLs in seven eyes from seven patients treated between May 1999 and May 2001. RESULTS: Mean age at the time of TSIOL surgery was 33 +/- 6 years. Mean time from TSIOL surgery to its subluxation was 78 +/- 19 months. Initial diagnoses requiring TSIOL surgeries were previous history of trauma and Marfan syndrome. Subluxation of TSIOLs was associated with blunt trauma in three eyes, whereas the other four eyes experienced spontaneous lens dislocation. CONCLUSION: Subluxation of TSIOL is not uncommon in younger patients with history of trauma or Marfan syndrome.
