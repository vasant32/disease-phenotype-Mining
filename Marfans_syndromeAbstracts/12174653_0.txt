The natural history of patients with Marfan syndrome is depressing, however, cardiovascular surgery can improve the prognosis. We reviewed the results of this surgical procedure for 10 years. Fourteen Marfan patients underwent cardiovascular surgery for a total of 21 times. Hospital mortality was 4.8% (1 case died on the 105th day after entire thoraco-abdominal aortic replacement because of pyothorax and sepsis), and the 5- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 92.9% and 77.4% respectively. Reoperation free rate was 51.4% and 38.6% respectively. Cardiovascular surgery in Marfan syndrome can be performed with good result. Aggressive surgical management and close follow-up of patients who undergo surgery is important.
