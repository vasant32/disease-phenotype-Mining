As measured by the Cobb angle, normal sagittal kyphosis is 20 degrees to 40 degrees, which encompasses most of the angulated consecutive vertebrae in the thoracic region of the spine. With pathologic kyphosis, however, the segmental analysis of different regions of the thoracic spine plays an important role. Methods of determining sagittal measurements as well as the causes of kyphosis of the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine, including Scheuermann's disease, spinal cord injury, laminectomy, neurofibromatosis, genetic origins, Marfan syndrome, and tuberculosis, are also important in determining treatment.
