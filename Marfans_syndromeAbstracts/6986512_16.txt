We reviewed a consecutive series of 90 patients undergoing concomitant resection of ascending aortic anerysm and aortic valve replacement (AVR) utilizing noncomposite "conventional" techniques in order to assess the early and late results, to define limitations of this operative approach, and thereby to clarify the indications for composite reconstruction of the aortic root. Mean age was 55 years. Twenty percent had Marfan's syndrome, and 13% had aortic dissections. The cause of the aneurysm was dissection in 13%  of cases, syphilis in 11%, atherosclerosis in 9%, and degeneration (with or without cystic medionecrosis) in 67%. Follow-up averaged 3.8 years and extended to 11.5 years maximum. AVR and complete excision of the aneurysm (preserving small tongues of aortic wall circumscribing the coronary artery ostia) coupled with tubular graft replacement of the ascending aorta were performed. Nineteen percent of patients required individual technical modifications relating to the coronary arteries. Operative mortality rate was 13%, with the majority of deaths being due to cardiac causes. Contemporary (1975 to 1978) operative mortality rate was 4.3%. Seven percent required re-exploration for hemorrhage and 2.4% had perioperative myocardial infarctions. Late functional results were generally good (average N.Y.H.A. Class 1.4). Late thromboembolism, angina, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure occurred at linearized rates of 3.4% per patient-year, 4.9% per patient-year, 1.1% per patient-year, and 5.2% per patient-year, respectively. No prosthetic valve endocarditis, graft infection, or recurrent aneurysms of the aortic root were observed. Late reoperation was necessary in eight patients (3% per patient-year), but reoperation for disease confined to the ascending aorta accounted for only three of these cases (1.1% per patient-year). Overall actuarial survival rates were 67% +/- 5% at 5 years and 50% +/- 9% at 10 years; survival rates for the 78 operative survivors were 77% +/- 5% and 57% +/- 10% at the same time intervals, respectively. Only one late death could be attributed to complications arising in the reconstructed aortic root. These results confirm that such simple, noncomposite techniques are safe, portend minimal risk of late complications and the attendant necessity for reoperation, and provide satisfactory long-term survival. We believe that composite techniques should be primarily reserved for selected cases of advanced necrotizing prosthetic or natural endocarditis.
