About 2 per cent of the deliveries are recorded in patients with heart diseases. Between 1983 and 1987, 30 pregnant women with congenital cardiovascular diseases (CCVD) were studied retrospectively on the basis of clinical observation cards and operation records. Detected during the first trimester of pregnancy, 13 cases underwent therapeutical abortion, in a case in whom life was threatened a hysterotomy was performed while 16 CCVD cases carried on their pregnancies to the end. Eleven of them delivered by caesarean section and 5 had a natural delivery. In a patient with dissecting aneurysm of aorta (Marfan's syndrome) death occurred after caesarean section. Six CCVD had been corrected by previous surgery. In conclusion it is stated that in pregnant women CCVD is a high risk. Surgical correction of CCVD, preferably outside the pregnancy period, is the best prophylaxis of the incidents in the cardiac pregnant women.
