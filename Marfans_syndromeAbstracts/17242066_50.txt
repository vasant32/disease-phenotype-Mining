We have discovered that fibrillin-1, which forms extracellular microfibrils, can regulate the bioavailability of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1, a powerful cytokine that modulates cell survival and phenotype. Altered TGFbeta signaling is a major contributor to the pathology of Marfan syndrome (MFS) and related diseases. In the presence of cell layer extracellular matrix, a fibrillin-1 sequence encoded by exons 44-49 releases endogenous TGFbeta1, thereby stimulating TGFbeta receptor-mediated Smad2 signaling. This altered TGFbeta1 bioavailability does not require intact cells, proteolysis, or the altered expression of TGFbeta1 or its receptors. Mass spectrometry revealed that a fibrillin-1 fragment containing the TGFbeta1-releasing sequence specifically associates with full-length fibrillin-1 in cell layers. Solid-phase and BIAcore binding studies showed that this fragment interacts strongly and specifically with N-terminal fibrillin-1, thereby inhibiting the association of C-terminal latent TGFbeta-binding protein 1 (a component of the large latent complex [LLC]) with N-terminal fibrillin-1. By releasing LLC from microfibrils, the fibrillin-1 sequence encoded by exons 44-49 can contribute to MFS and related diseases.
