The authors' experience with the surgical repair of thoracic deformities in 45 adult patients is reported. The most frequent deformity was pectus excavatum (n = 42), the asymmetric form of which was observed in 59 % of our patients. The patients were treated by means of a modified Ravitch method, with the retrosternal introduction of a Jensen strut. The strut was left in place for one year and then was removed via a small incision. With the exception of two cases of postoperative pneumothorax, no other postoperative complications were seen and no patient died. In the follow-up 1 year after removal of the Jensen strut, no recurrent deformities were observed in 36 patients. On the basis of these results, we consider the described technique as the method of choice in the treatment of congenital thoracic deformities in adult patients.
