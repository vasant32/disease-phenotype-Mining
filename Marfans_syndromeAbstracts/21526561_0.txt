Aim of the study was to elucidate causes of repeat operations and their outcomes in patients with the Marfan's syndrome. Between December 1972 and January 2009 60 patients with Marfan's syndrome were operated for aneurysm of the ascending aorta and aortic insufficiency. All patients were subjected to ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement with valve containing conduit. Five of 60 patients (8.3%) were subjected to 7 repeat operations (2 patients were reoperated twice). Causes of repeat interventions were: conduit dysfunction (n=3), abdominal aortic aneurysm (n=3), mitral valve prolapse (n=1). Three patients died: 2 during surgery because of impaired conduit function, one - in 1 year after repeat operation of mitral valve replacement for mitral valve prolapse with pronounced mitral insufficiency. In all cases cause of death was progressive heart failure. As an example a case of a female patient who had been subjected to repetitive surgeries because of malfunctioning conduit is presented in this paper. Main reason for reoperations was the Marfan's syndrome itself. Progression of this disease might continue after operation, alteration of the aortic wall promote dissection in regions not subjected to prosthetics. Application of prostheses especially designed for replacement of the ascending aorta excludes such causes of reoperations and death as disruption of old sutured of two parts conduits.
