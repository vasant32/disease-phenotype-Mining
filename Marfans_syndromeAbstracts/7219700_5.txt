A case of Marfan's syndrome is described in which progressive neurological signs and symptoms were produced by flexion of the head. Radiological examinations revealed hypermotility between the atlas and axis, as well as compression of the medulla oblongata by the odontoid process on flexion, since low positioned cerebellar tonsils prevented dorsal shift of the oblongata. The signs and symptoms disappeared after occipitocervical internal transfixation.
