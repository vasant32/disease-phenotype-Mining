A case of bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax in a 14-year-old girl with previously undiagnosed Marfan's syndrome is described. The pulmonary abnormalities of Marfan's syndrome are not commonly encountered and bilateral pneumothorax is itself a rare event which, in most instances, has been reported following invasive procedures.
