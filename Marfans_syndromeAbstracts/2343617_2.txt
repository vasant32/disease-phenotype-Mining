We report on 4 cases of profuse lentiginosis (LEOPARD syndrome); 3 of these were familial and associated with Marfan's syndrome. This combination has, to the best of our knowledge, never been mentioned before. In addition we found alterations of the blood vessels never described so far. Our 4th patient is an 18-year-old girl sporadically suffering from LEOPARD syndrome.
