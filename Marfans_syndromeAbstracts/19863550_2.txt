Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of the fibrous connective tissue caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. Although clinical and genetic analyses have been performed in various populations, there have been few studies in Korea. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and genetic background of Korean patients with MFS. In 39 Korean patients with MFS who met the Ghent criteria, the most common clinical finding was aortic dilatation and/or dissection (94.9%), whereas only 35.9% of patients had ectopia lentis. The majority of MFS patients had fewer than four of the skeletal findings required to fulfill the major skeletal Ghent criterion for MFS. Only 21% of Korean patients had major skeletal abnormalities and most cases showed only minor skeletal involvement. FBN1 gene mutations were detected in 35 out of 39 patients (89.7%), which is similar to rates presented in the previous reports. These results suggest that some clinical features in Korean patients with MFS differed from those reported in Western MFS patients.
