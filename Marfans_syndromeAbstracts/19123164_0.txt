PURPOSE: The authors present a patient with Marfan syndrome who underwent cataract surgery using a novel device for fixation of capsular bag. METHODS: The capsule fixation device (CFD) is poly(methyl methacrylate) arch with double-armed bent hook that can be introduced into the anterior chamber through the clear corneal incision, placed with a rest on the capsule equator, and sutured to the sclera without injury of the capsular bag. A 16-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome underwent consecutive phacoemulsification with in-the-bag intraocular lens and CFD implantation on both eyes. RESULTS: During the surgery handling the CFD was technically simple with good visualization. The preoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 0.3 and 0.1 and postoperatively 0.6 and 0.8 in the right and left eyes, respectively. The postoperative follow-up was over 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the CFD was successful in a case of lens subluxation with no complications observed during the period of follow-up.
