 PURPOSE: To evaluate central corneal thickness (CCT) in normal children (controls) and in those with cataracts, pseudophakia, and aphakia. DESIGN: Prospective, observational case series. METHODS: CCT was measured in 369 eyes of 223 children. Subjects with glaucoma, anterior segment abnormalities, or intraocular pressure of more than 30 mm Hg were excluded. Group means were compared for controls and for eyes with pediatric cataracts, pseudophakia, and aphakia. RESULTS: The mean CCT of eyes with cataracts was more than that of controls (574 +/- 54 microm [n = 46] and 552 +/- 38 microm [n = 230], respectively; P = .001). After excluding from the cataract group those eyes with aniridia, Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, or glaucoma surgery, the mean CCT (564 +/- 34 microm [n = 36]) was no longer greater than that of controls (P = .07). The mean CCT of pseudophakic eyes (598 +/- 56 microm [n = 29]) was greater than the mean CCT of controls (P < .001) and was similar to the mean CCT of eyes with cataracts (P = .06). The mean CCT of aphakic eyes (642 +/- 88 microm [n = 64]) was greater than the mean CCT of controls (P < .001), eyes with cataracts (P < .001), and eyes with pseudophakia (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of factors known to affect CCT (Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and aniridia), CCT is similar in eyes with pediatric cataracts and normal controls and increases after cataract surgery.
