 PURPOSE: To report the anatomic and visual results of retinal detachment in patients with Marfan syndrome in an Asian population. METHOD: A retrospective review of all patients with Marfan syndrome and retinal detachment operated on by a single surgeon was conducted. RESULTS: Thirteen eyes of 12 patients were reviewed. Eleven patients were males, with an average age of 24.6 years. Three eyes had a history of trauma. Ten eyes were successfully treated with scleral buckle and encircling band. Three eyes were also treated with vitrectomy, scleral buckle, and encircling band. One hundred percent success was achieved with only one surgery. Best-corrected visual acuity of at least 20/40 was achieved in 7 of 12 eyes (58.3%). Eight of 12 eyes (66.7%) had at least two lines of improvement on the Snellen chart after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate surgical intervention, an excellent anatomic reattachment rate and good visual outcome can be achieved in Marfan syndrome patients with retinal detachment regardless of their lens status.
