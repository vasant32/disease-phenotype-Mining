 PURPOSE: Single-cell nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Ddel endonuclease digestion were used to detect the presence of a Marfan's syndrome mutation in human preimplantation embryos derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF). These procedures were conducted to eliminate the possibility of transmission of the affected allele from the father to his offspring. The mutation on chromosome 15 is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, and the chance of having a child affected with the disease is 50%. METHODS: A couple presented to the Program for In Vitro Fertilization, Reproductive Surgery and Infertility for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. IVF was performed and embryo biopsy was done on day 3 embryos. Single blastomeres were removed from embryos and subjected to nested PCR analysis and endonuclease digestion to detect a Marfan's syndrome mutation located on chromosome 15 inherited from the father. RESULTS: Thirteen oocytes were injected with spermatozoa using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and nine fertilized normally. Following embryo biopsy and polymerase chain reaction amplification-Ddel endonuclease digestion, five embryos were detected that were positive for the mutation. The four non-affected embryos were transferred to the uterus, resulting in a healthy and normal ongoing pregnancy.
