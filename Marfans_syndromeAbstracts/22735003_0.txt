A novel technique of valve-sparing aortic root replacement was applied to 2 children younger than 3 years of age with Marfan syndrome and large aortic root aneurysms. Using elements of both the remodeling and reimplantation techniques, circumferential rings from a 20-mm to 22-mm polyester graft provide stabilization at the subannular and sinotubular levels, and bovine pericardial patches create pseudosinuses. Follow-up at 2 years in 1 patient and 7 months in a second patient revealed satisfactory valve function with stable aortic root size.
