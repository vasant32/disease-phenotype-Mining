 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the surgical technique and indication on descending aortic aneurysms. METHODS: From January 1996 to June 2006, 41 patients with descending aortic aneurysm underwent operation, including DeBakey type III dissection in 26, false aneurysm in 6, true aneurysm in 4, and residual or newly complicated type III dissection after the surgery of Marfan syndrome in 5. Operations were performed by left heart bypass in 9, femoral-femoral bypass in 7, pulmonary-femoral bypass in 2, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in 23. The whole thoracic descending aorta was replaced in 15, and intercostal arteries were reimplanted in 12. RESULTS: One patient died of acute renal failure with the hospital mortality 2.4%. Main complications: respiratory dysfunction in 6, renal dysfunction in 6, recurrent nerve injuries in 4, chylothorax in 2, and no paraplegia. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention of descending aortic aneurysm still has its unique advantages and indications; surgical safety is markedly improved by the use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
