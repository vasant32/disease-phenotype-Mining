People with Marfan syndrome present with a range of health problems that require specialised nursing, medical and surgical care. They face many challenges throughout their lives - some of which may be life-threatening - and require continuing support and education from a specialist team. Nurses play a pivotal role in the care of people with Marfan syndrome and their families, encompassing not only medical and surgical interventions, but aspects of lifestyle such as diet, exercise and hobbies, as well as family planning and psychological well-being.
