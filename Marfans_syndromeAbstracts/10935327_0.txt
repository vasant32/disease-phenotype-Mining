The cardiovascular lesions commonly seen in Marfan syndrome can frequently be the primary cause of premature death. Cardiac lesions involving both the mitral valve and the aortic root are commonly observed among patients diagnosed during early infancy, as so-called infantile Marfan syndrome. Since the lesions tend to progress rapidly with the end results of high morbidity and mortality, the majority of patients require surgical intervention at a young age. However, patients who undergo surgical intervention for both lesions during the first decade of life have been rarely reported in literature. In this report, we present a case of a 9-year-old boy who underwent aortic root replacement with a composite graft at 3.5 years after a prior prosthetic valve replacement of the mitral valve. Although the immediate result was satisfactory, the long-term result remains to be seen.
