Sixteen patients aged 13 to 55 with severe rigid spine deformities were treated by two-stage anterior and posterior vertebral column resection, fusion, and segmental spinal instrumentation. The purpose of the vertebral column resection was to eliminate pain, prevent progressive deformity, and obtain the maximum correction necessary to achieve spinal balance in the coronal and sagittal plane. The final scoliosis correction averaged 43%. Physiologic sagittal alignment was achieved in all patients. Complications occurred in seven patients (43%). It is our conclusion, based on this series, that the concept of decancellation, radical vertebral column resection, spinal shortening, and segmental instrumentation posteriorly can achieve a balanced correction and significant pain relief for the select patient who presents with severe rigid spine deformity not adequately treatable by more established techniques.
