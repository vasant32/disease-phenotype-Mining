Morphological and cytophysiological indices of cells and cellular populations were studied during this stationary phase. In difference from normal cell strains which displayed a definite complex of ontogenetic changes, cells of the strains with chromosomal and gene mutations showed individual differences apparently caused by disturbed differentiation and by expression of features characteristic of malignant cells.
