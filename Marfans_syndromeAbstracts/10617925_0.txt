Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular anomalies. Ectopia lentis is the most common ocular manifestation. We report an ocular sign not previously described in Marfan syndrome, iridocorneal adhesions secondary to anterior lens subluxation. Three patients with the Marfan syndrome had iridocorneal adhesions on slit-lamp examination. One patient developed adhesions following treatment with pilocarpine. She underwent pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy in both eyes due to progression of the iridocorneal adhesions. Treatment with miotics rotates the lens-iris diaphragm anteriorly and may contribute to the formation of such adhesions. The two other patients remained stable and did not received lensectomy or vitrectomy. Careful slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment should be conducted in patients with dislocated lenses.
