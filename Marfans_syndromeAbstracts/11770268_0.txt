A 10-year-old boy with a medical history of fatigue became nauseous, short of breath and cyanotic within 24 hours after a frightening incident. He was successfully resuscitated after a cardiac arrest. A CT scan revealed a ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta. During emergency surgery the ascending aorta and aortic arch were replaced with a 22 mm synthetic graft. No postoperative complications occurred. There was no associated trauma, syphilis, collagen diseases (Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), congenital heart disease or autoimmune disease. The cause of the aneurysm and rupture remain unclear.
