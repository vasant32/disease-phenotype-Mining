A 25-year-old Marfan patient was operated on for an acute type A aortic dissection that was complicated twice by false aneurysms at the distal suture line. At the third episode a covered endoprosthesis was inserted in the ascending aorta between the coronary ostia and the inominate artery. The postoperative course was uneventful and a control computed tomographic scan showed complete occlusion of the false aneurysm. This attractive technique should be considered versus an open-heart operation in selected patients.
