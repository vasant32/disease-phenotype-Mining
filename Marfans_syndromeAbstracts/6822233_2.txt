Epilepsy associated with Marfan's syndrome is rare. Although previous observations have shown that Marfan's patients with epilepsy had angioid streaks in the retina or coloboma of the iris, such ocular manifestations were absent in two patients reported here. One patient with mental retardation and lumbosacral meningocele had generalized seizure. Another patient with sinus bradyarrhythmia and prolapsed mitral valve had partial seizure with secondary generalization. This report and review of the literature suggest that epilepsy in Marfan's syndrome can be due to primary CNS disorders or secondary to disorders of connective tissue.
