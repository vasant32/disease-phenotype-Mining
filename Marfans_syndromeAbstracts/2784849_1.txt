Nine eyes with lens subluxation in seven patients (6 patients with Marfan's syndrome, 1 with idiopathic lens subluxation) were treated by neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser zonulysis. The procedure uses an Nd:YAG laser to lyse the zonules to obtain a clear aphakic visual axis. Pretreatment best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 or worse in eight eyes (6 eyes less than or equal to 20/200). Movement of the crystalline lens was achieved after zonulysis in all cases (100%), and a clear aphakic visual axis, sufficient to maintain aphakic correction without diplopia or glare, was obtained in eight eyes (88.9%). The procedure was combined with optical iridotomy in three cases (33.3%). Five cases (55.6%) required more than one zonulysis treatment. Visual acuity improved two or more Snellen lines in all but one eye (7 eyes greater than or equal to 20/60). Four cases had complications which included: increased intraocular pressure (IOP), mild iritis, recurrent migration of the lens into the visual axis, and crystalline lens damage. The final two complications necessitated eventual surgical removal of the lens. These results suggest that Nd:YAG laser zonulysis may be of benefit as an alternative treatment modality for selected patients with lens subluxation.
