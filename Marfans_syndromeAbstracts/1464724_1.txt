Marfan's syndrome is a connective tissue disorder, which mainly affects the cardiovascular system, together with ocular, skeletal and connective tissue. The cardiovascular manifestations in particular determine the mortality of this disorder. We studied 13 patients, suffering of Marfan's syndrome, with suspected aortic dilatation by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root and dissection were the two major findings in our study. Two of the five patients with dissections presented without relevant symptoms in the medical history nor at the time of the MRI examination.
