Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) has been associated with several connective tissue disorders, including Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum. We present a case of MVP in a patient with epidermolysis bullosa. The authors are aware of only one previously reported case of this association. A 49-year-old man with a history of epidermolysis bullosa since childhood was admitted to our institution due to dyspnea on effort. On general examination he was observed to have alopecia, deformities in his nails, and fusions of his fingers. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the presence of MVP. In addition, coronary angiography showed three-vessel disease. Mitral valve replacement (ATS valve 25 mm) and coronary artery bypass grafting (left internal thoracic artery-LAD) were performed. The resected mitral valve (anterior leaflet) contained the area of the myxomatous lesion histologically. The pathological mechanism of epidermolysis bullosa is thought to be the destruction of collagen fibers due to increased levels of enzyme collagenase. Therefore there may be a common cause of MVP and epidermolysis bullosa based upon an abnormality of collagen metabolism.
