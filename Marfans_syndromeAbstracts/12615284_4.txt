Aortic elasticity has been identified as a potential risk factor for aortic complications. Groenink et al  demonstrated decreased aortic elasticity determined by measurement of local distensibility and flow wave velocity (FWV) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with the Marfan syndrome who did not undergo operation. Aortic elasticity after aortic root replacement (ARR) has not yet been investigated, but Imawaki et al  demonstrated decreased aortic distensibility in patients with the Marfan syndrome after surgery of the abdominal and thoracic aorta. This study investigates the feasibility of MRI for assessing aortic elasticity in patients with the Marfan syndrome after elective ARR, and compares aortic elasticity in these patients with the aortic elasticity of patients with the Marfan syndrome who did not undergo surgery using MRI.
