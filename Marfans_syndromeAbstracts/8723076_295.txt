In 1986, the diagnosis of the Marfan syndrome was codified on the basis of clinical criteria in the Berlin nosology [Beighton et al., 1988]. Over time, weaknesses have emerged in these criteria, a problem accentuated by the advent of molecular testing. In this paper, we propose a revision of diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome and related conditions. Most notable are: more stringent requirements for diagnosis of the Marfan syndrome in relatives of an unequivocally affected individual; skeletal involvement as a major criterion if at least 4 of 8 typical skeletal manifestations are present; potential contribution of molecular analysis to the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome; and delineation of initial criteria for diagnosis of other heritable conditions with partially overlapping phenotypes.
