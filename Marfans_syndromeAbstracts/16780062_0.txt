A 34-year-old man with Marfan syndrome was admitted to our hospital for surgical treatment of aortic regurgitation due to annuloaortic ectasia. He had no history of bleeding complications. Preoperative investigation revealed a slight prolongation of an activated partial thromboplastin time, which went unnoticed. He underwent aortic root replacement with a composite valve graft. During the operation, he had excessive bleeding due to coagulopathy after the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, and needed a large amount of blood transfusion to obtain hemostasis. Before his discharge from our hospital, he was diagnosed as mild hemophilia A because of the decline in his factor VII level. To our knowledge, there has been no published case of cardiac operations in Marfan syndrome with hemophilia A.
