We describe 3 patients in whom a composite dura mater valve-Dacron tube graft was used for replacement of the entire ascending aorta and aortic valve. Two patients had Marfan's syndrome and 1, a chronic aortic dissection, type II. All had severe aortic regurgitation. There were no early or late deaths in a follow-up period of 2, 7, and 12 months, respectively. All 3 patients were asymptomatic when last seen. Two underwent postoperative aortography that disclosed well-functioning valves and good filling of the coronary arteries. It is concluded that annuloaortic ectasia is best treated by the technique of total replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve by a composite valve-tube graft, and that the homologous dura mater valve, for its characteristics of central flow, lack of need for anticoagulants, and durability, represents a reasonable alternative for use in this situation.
