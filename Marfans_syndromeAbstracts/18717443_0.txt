A 39-year-old man with Marfan syndrome underwent scleral fixation using a three-piece foldable intraocular lens and experienced repeated pupillary intraocular lens captures secondary to a pliable iris. As a result, the patient needed an additional pupilloplasty. In the opposite eye, a silicone plate haptic intraocular lens was used for scleral fixation because it was thought that the plate design could prevent pupillary intraocular lens capture, even in cases involving a pliable iris. At the 27-month follow-up examination, the patient showed good centration of the intraocular lens in the eye that used the silicone plate haptic intraocular lens without pupillary intraocular lens capture.
