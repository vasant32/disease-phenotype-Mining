Many authors hypothesize that mitral valve prolapse (MVP) can be, in most cases, only a clinical sign of a primitive and systemic disorder of the connective tissue, like in Marfan Syndrome (MS). In our previous works we supported the presence of morphological and functional alterations of the microcirculation in patients affected by MS. In order to characterize a possible common denominator between these pathologies we have studied the cutaneous microcirculation in a group of patients affected by MVP, divided into 2 groups: anatomic MVP (MVP) and MVP syndrome (MVPS). The morphologic parameters have been investigated by nailfold capillaroscopy while digital laser-Doppler was used to study skin flowmetry. The results have been compared with a control group. Capillaroscopic remarkers showed an architecturally disorganized microvasculature with aspects related to a reduced compactness of the microvasculature unit with a significatively higher score compared with controls (7.3 +/- 2.9 vs 3.6 +/- 1 p less than 0.0005). Laser-Doppler flowmetry showed a significatively reduced rest flow; ischemic test showed: spike time 48.9 +/- 36.9 vs 15.3 +/- 7.7 s (p less than 0.0005), hyperemic acme 6.6 +/- 2.7 vs 12.5 +/- 8.4 UP (p less than 0.002); % increase 32.1 +/- 20.2 vs 51.5 +/- 15.4 (p less than 0.002). Thermic test showed a significatively higher thermic acme 8.7 +/- 4.2 vs 12.6 +/- 9.11 UP (p less than 0.05). These results appeared to be correlated with stage pathology as it was observed a severe microvasculature disorders in MVPS. Therefore we suppose that a phenotypic continuum may exist between MS and MVP.
