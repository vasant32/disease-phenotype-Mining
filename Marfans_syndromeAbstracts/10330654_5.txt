Two patients had a subluxated crystalline lens: one with Marfan's syndrome and the other with traumatic cataract. A pars plana lensectomy with transscleral fixation of a foldable silicone intraocular lens rather than a conventional poly(methyl methacrylate) lens was performed. Excellent, rapid visual rehabilitation was obtained using this small incision technique.
