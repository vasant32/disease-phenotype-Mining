Major cardiovascular lesions associated with Marfan syndrome include aortic diseases such as aortic root dilatation and mitral disease. If untreated, cardiovascular manifestations of the Marfan syndrome cause death in one half of patients during the first four decades of life. Although aortic diseases in the Marfan syndrome are responsible for most of serious morbidity and mortality, 60-80% of patients with Marfan syndrome have mitral valve dysfunction. The results of surgical treatment for aortic diseases in Marfan patients have recently shown significant improvement. However, there is no acceptable consensus about the timing and the technique of surgical intervention for mitral diseases. Especially mitral valve diseases is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in infants with the Marfan syndrome. We report herein a case of Marfan syndrome (21-year-old female) who had undergone two operations for aortic root dilatation five years before she underwent the surgical treatment for progressive heart failure due to severe mitral annulus enlargement and mitral regurgitation.
