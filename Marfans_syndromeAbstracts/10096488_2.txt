BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: Composite graft replacement of the aortic root is still a complex operation, transgraft hemorrhage being one of the most severe complications. The aim of the study was to evaluate early results with the Carbo-seal composite conduit for aortic root replacement. METHODS: A retrospective review of 21 patients operated on for ascending aortic aneurysm and/or dissection with the open technique between August 1993 and February 1998 is presented; 12 patients had Marfan syndrome and nine were non-Marfan. RESULTS: There were two operative deaths (9.5%) due to low cardiac output. Two patients were re-explored for bleeding which was not due to transgraft hemorrhage. Postoperative complications were one hemothorax, one pneumothorax and two pericardial effusions. During the follow up, one patient died of rupture of a descending aortic aneurysm, and one patient in atrial fibrillation had a transient ischemic attack. At the closing of the follow up, the remaining patients were well and free of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Carbo-seal may be considered a reliable device for use in aortic root replacement, though a longer follow up and a larger patient population are necessary to confirm these positive early results.
