We surgically treated a 35-year-old male with acute 3-channeled aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome. He had acute type A aortic dissection, and underwent Bentall's type operation, simultaneous graft replacement of the ascending aorta and total aortic arch. Pain recurred 5 years and 9 months after the first operation. CT scan showed two adjacent false lumens in the descending aorta. The morphology of the first and second dissections was Stanford type A + B. The second dissection was acute. In the second false lumen, a re-entry formation was observed in the abdominal aorta. Because severe pain was persistent, we immediately replaced the descending aorta using a femoro-femoral partial cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient was doing well and was discharged. When pain recurs in a Marfan patient with an aortic dissection, a 3-channeled aortic dissection should be suspected, and we recommend emergency surgery.
