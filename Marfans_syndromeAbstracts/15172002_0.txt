An arginine to glutamine substitution in the triple helix of proalpha2(I)collagen (R618Q) was first reported in a patient with a variant of Marfan syndrome and later identified in conjunction with a second mutation in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The presence of the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen allele in unaffected or mildly affected family members suggests that the R618Q allele is either a non-affecting polymorphism or a potential genetic modifier. Conservation of arginine618 across species and fibrillar collagen types suggests it is functionally significant. To investigate the functional significance of the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen allele, we isolated type I collagen from cultured dermal fibroblasts of control and two unrelated individuals heterozygous for the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen allele and evaluated helical stability and fibrillar assembly. Type I collagen thermal stability analyzed by protease susceptibility and CD spectroscopy demonstrated no statistical difference between control and R618Q containing collagen molecules. In vitro fibril assembly analyses demonstrated that R618Q containing collagen exhibits rapid fibrillar growth with minimal fibril nucleation phase. Further, electron microscopy demonstrated that the diameter of assembled R618Q containing collagen fibrils was approximately 20% of control collagen fibrils. These findings suggest the R618Q variant does not impact triple helical stability but has a role in collagen fibril assembly, supporting the hypothesis that the R618Q proalpha2(I)collagen variant is a modifier of connective tissue structure/function and is potentially involved in disease pathogenesis.
