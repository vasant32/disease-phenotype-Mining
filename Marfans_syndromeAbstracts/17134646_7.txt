Marfan syndrome is a widespread disorder of connective tissue. It is characterized by systemic and ocular features due to mutations in the fibrillin gene. Awareness and prompt recognition of the ocular complications of Marfan syndrome may enable improvement and preservation of sight. Studies have been performed in the last few years that enable a better understanding of the genetics of the syndrome, earlier diagnosis, and improvement in the surgical techniques and options.
