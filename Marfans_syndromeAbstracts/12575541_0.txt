Different chest deformations are accompanied by appearance of asbestos-like fibrills in pericellular matrix, development of significant lipid and carbohydrate chondrocyte dystrophy, irreversible changes in their majority. Anomalous accumulation of intermediate filaments, lipid and glycogen, may substitute the cytoplasm organells in Marfan's syndrome. Pathologic disturbances of costal cartilage, connected with ultrastructural changes of chondrocytes, intercellular substance and extracellular matrix are morphologic substrate of different chest deformations.
