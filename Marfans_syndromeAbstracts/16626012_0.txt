The authors present an unusual case of an urgent aneurysm of the superficial femoral artery in a young patient. The case raised a suspicion of a possibility of a genetic collagen disorder, primarily of the Marfan's syndrome. Also a malignant ethiology of the process was considered. The finding was managed by its radical extirpation and the resected part of the superficial femoral artery was replaced by a reverse graft of the vena saphaena magna. The original diagnosis of the Marfan's syndrome or a malignancy was not confirmed.
