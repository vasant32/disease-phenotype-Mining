Surgical treatment of ectopia lentis has traditionally been associated with a poor visual outcome and a high complication rate. We treated a series of nine children (15 eyes) whose visual acuity could not be improved with optimal optical phakic or aphakic correction with limbal lensectomy. Preoperative visual acuity after amblyopia treatment ranged from 20/60 to 20/200. Improvement in postoperative visual acuity was documented in all operated-on eyes, ranging from 20/20 to 20/50 during a follow-up period ranging from 8 months to 118 months (median, 33 months). The only complication was a child who developed a secondary membrane requiring a neodymium-YAG capsulotomy.
