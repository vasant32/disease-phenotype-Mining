PURPOSE: To investigate corneal thickness, curvature, and morphology with the Orbscan Topography System I (Bausch & Lomb, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and to study MFS with in vivo confocal microscopy. METHODS: This prospective, clinical, comparative case series included 60 eyes of 31 patients with MFS and 32 eyes of 17 control subjects. First, biomicroscopic examination was conducted to search for ectopia lentis. Then, mean keratometry and ocular refractive power were calculated by the autokeratorefractometer. In each group, the Orbscan System I mean (and mean simulated) keratometry and pachymetric measurements (at the central location and at eight midperipheral locations) were obtained and compared, and correlations were established. In vivo confocal microscopy was performed to evaluate tissue morphology and Z-scan analysis of 14 thin MFS corneas compared with 14 control corneas. RESULTS: A significant decrease (ANOVA, P < 0.0001) of mean simulated keratometry measurement appeared in the MFS group (sim K, 40.8 +/- 1.4 D) compared with the control group (42.9 +/- 1.1 D). Pachymetry in the MFS group was significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) compared with that in the control group, in the center (respectively, 502 +/- 41.9 microm and 552 +/- 23.6 microm) and the eight midperipheral locations. Ectopia lentis was highly linked with mean keratometry and pachymetry (P < 0.0001). Confocal microscopy performed on MFS-affected thin corneas confirmed the corneal thinning and showed an opaque stromal matrix, and Z-scan profiles were abnormal with increased stromal back scattering of light. CONCLUSIONS: MFS is known to be associated with a flattened cornea. This study demonstrated an association with corneal thinning and described confocal microscopy findings in this syndrome.
