Anterior sacral meningocele is a not rare entity. Treatment is usually surgical and consists in a transacral posterior approach with patching of the communication between the malformation and the dural sac. But surgery can be difficult and require multiple procedures. We report the first case of a giant anterior sacral meeningocele rapidly cured by a simple endoscopic procedure. We believe that more attention should be used in the diagnosis of such cases as they can be so easily cured. We have reviewed the literature about anterior sacral meningocele and particularly its treatment and its association either with Marfan syndrome or a familial occurrence.
