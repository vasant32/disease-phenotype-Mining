A 27-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome underwent a total aortic graft replacement in three separate stages. Initially the abdominal aorta was replaced, followed by the ascending aorta and aortic arch, and finally the residual portion. The extensive reconstruction of both the ascending and transverse aorta at the second operation, even though no dissection was present in the aortic arch, reduced the risk of the subsequent operation since the same surgical approach did not have to be used.
