Three types of cardioplegic delivery with ink into the isolated canine hearts were compared: (1) antegrade aortic root perfusion (AARP), (2) retrograde coronary sinus perfusion (RCSP) and (3) retrograde right atrium perfusion (RRAP). Ink was not distributed in the area distal to the coronary occlusion by AARP but well distribution in the same area by RCSP or RRAP. The right ventricular wall and ventricular septum were poorly perfused by RCSP but well perfused by RRAP. During cardiopulmonary bypass, RRAP created a fairly rapid cardiac arrest and satisfactory myocardial cooling. During Perfusion, the right heart was somewhat dilated but all the 10 canine hearts rebeat well. The left and right ventricular ejection fraction showed no significant change after bypass. No marked myocardial ultrastructural injury was found in left and right ventricles at the end of 90 minutes' ischemia. 4 patient, 1 of whom had 162 minutes' aortic cross-clamping received RRAP in operations on ascending aorta or coronary arteries and the myocardial protect ion was satisfactory. No complication was found pertaining to RRAP.
