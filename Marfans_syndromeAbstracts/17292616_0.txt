Ruptured aortic root aneurysm is very rare in children less than 10 years of age. Isolated dilatation of the ascending aorta and/or aortic root in a child is mostly associated with Marfan's syndrome, and the standard surgical treatment is aortic root replacement with a composite valve graft or homograft. We report here a successful emergent T. David-V operation using two grafts of different sizes for a ruptured aortic root aneurysm in a 9-year-old child with Marfan's syndrome.
