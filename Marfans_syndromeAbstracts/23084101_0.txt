OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the fate of the native aortic root after replacement of the ascending aorta to treat acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS: Between June 1985 and January 2010, 319 consecutive patients (mean age, 63 ± 11 years) with acute type A aortic dissection underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with preservation of the aortic root. The aortic valve was also replaced in 21 of these patients (7%). The intervention was extended to the aortic arch in 210 patients (66%), of whom 173 (54%) underwent hemiarch replacement, and 37 (12%), total arch replacement. RESULTS: There were 109 (34%) in-hospital deaths. Of the 210 discharged patients, survival was 95%, 58%, and 27% at 1, 10, and 23 years, respectively. Freedom from reoperation on the proximal aorta was reported by 97%, 92%, and 82% patients at 5, 10, and 23 years, respectively. Twelve patients were reoperated for aortic root dilatation and 2 died during reoperation. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that significant risk factors for proximal reoperation were age <60 years (P = .005; relative risk, 1.94) and Marfan syndrome (P = .011; relative risk, 2.76). At follow-up, 15 patients (11%) had an aortic root diameter of >45 mm, but they were not reoperated. CONCLUSIONS: For acute type A aortic dissection, replacement of the ascending aorta with root preservation shows long-term effectiveness with low reoperation and aortic root dilatation rates.
