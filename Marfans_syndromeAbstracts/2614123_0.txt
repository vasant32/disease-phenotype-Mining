A successful case of simultaneous modified Bentall' procedure, MVR and sternoplasty was presented for a 42 years old man of Marfan's syndrome who had funnel chest, combined with mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation and annuloaortic ectasia. A few reports of one stage operation for the combination of funnel chest and heart disease in Marfan's syndrome has been published. A median sternotomy was made, with total cardiopulmonary bypass, heart was arrest and cor cooling hypothermia with crystalloid cardioplegic solution. Mitral valve was replaced with #31 B-S prosthetic valve. The ascending aorta proximal to the innominate artery and the aortic valve were replaced en-bloc with composite graft made of a vascular graft and aortic valve prostheses. Coronary artery orifices cut to the button-shaped, were sutured to the composite graft. Finally, sternoplasty was completed through modified Ravitch sterno-elevation. This is the first report in Japanese journals.
