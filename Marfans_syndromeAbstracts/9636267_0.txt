The prognosis of Marfan syndrome in both adult and pediatric patients is primarily related to the cardiovascular complications. In infantile Marfan syndrome, although involvement of the mitral valve is the most frequently encountered cardiovascular lesion, the aortic root can be more worrisome because of its excessive dilatation, leading to aortic insufficiency or dissection. If the role of elective surgery is relatively well defined for adult patients, it is still debated during childhood. We report two patients, aged 22 months and 5 years, each presenting an aortic root aneurysm related to Marfan syndrome, and each treated with the Bentall procedure without specific age-related mortality or morbidity. These two patients experienced normal growth and were free of any complication for a follow-up period of 8 and 2 years, respectively. More than an absolute value of the aortic root dimension, it is the conjunction of the rate of progression of the aortic root dilatation, the degree and the duration of the aortic valve regurgitation, and its resulting left ventricular dysfunction that must be taken into consideration in choosing the surgical option.
