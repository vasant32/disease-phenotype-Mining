We describe a 19-year-old boy who presented with facial dysmorphism, multiple lateral meningoceles, skeletal abnormalities and normal intelligence. Neurofibromatosis and Marfan syndrome were excluded. Electron microscopy of the skin showed non-specific abnormalities suggesting a connective tissue disorder. The features of this boy closely resemble those in a mother and daughter with Lehman syndrome.
