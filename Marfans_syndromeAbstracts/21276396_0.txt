Marfan syndrome (MFS) and MFS-related diseases are inherited connective tissue disorders involving several organ systems. The diagnosis of MFS is difficult as the many symptoms overlap with those of other systemic connective tissue diseases. The phenotype is progressive. Effective surgical therapy and standardized follow-up programs have led to an improved lifespan for the affected individuals. Selective angiotensin II, type 1 (AT1) blockers may improve several manifestations of MFS, but the outcome of clinical trials is presently unknown. This review describes the importance of a coordinated strategy for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.
