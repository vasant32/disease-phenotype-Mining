Between April 1988 and February 1992, eight patients with type A aortic dissection associated with annuloaortic ectasia (AAE) underwent the concomitant graft replacement of the total aortic root and the transverse aortic arch at our institution. The acuity of the aortic dissection was acute stage in 3 patients and chronic stage in 5 including 3 cases of re-do operation. All operations were performed with an aid of extracorporeal circulation, blood cardioplegia, selective cerebral perfusion and open distal anastomosis. The operative techniques employed in this series consisted of total aortic root replacement using a composite graft (Bentall, Cabrol or Piehler's technique), and total arch replacement using en bloc arch reconstruction or three vessels graft replacement. One patients underwent re-do operation for coronary anastomotic false aneurysm following Bentall operation and aneurysmal dilatation of the false lumen at the aortic arch, and died of LOS because of the prolonged myocardial ischemia. Other seven patients survived the operation, and lead the normal life at the present time. The present data suggests that type A aortic dissection associated with AAE involving aortic arch could be treated by concomitant graft replacement of the total aortic root and the transverse aortic arch.
