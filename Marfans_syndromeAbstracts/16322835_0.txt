 PURPOSE: To assess the results as to visual acuity of two different surgical procedures for ectopia lentis. METHODS: Fifty-one eyes of 28 patients (16 males and 12 females, mean age 16.00 +/- 8.5) with simple (19 cases) or Marfan syndrome-associated (9 cases) ectopia lentis with different levels of subluxation underwent lens extraction with implantation of intraocular lenses (IOL) with scleral fixation (21 cases) or by lens extraction with implantation of the intraocular lenses in the capsular bag expanded by endocapsular ring (RING) (30 cases). Result analysis emphasized pre- and postoperative visual acuity during a six-month follow-up. RESULTS: Both techniques showed significant increase of postoperative visual acuity with and without correction, but it was better among the cases operated on by scleral fixation of the intraocular lenses. More than the used technique, the preoperative subluxation grades were crucial as to the results. CONCLUSION: The two surgical techniques for correction of simple or Marfan syndrome-associated ectopia lentis are safe and effective, resulting in significant recovery of visual acuity, although surgical results are completely dependent on the preoperative lens subluxation grades.
