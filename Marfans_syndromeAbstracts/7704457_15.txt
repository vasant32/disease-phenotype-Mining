The objective of the study was to ascertain the occurrence and inter-relationships of locomotor symptoms, joint hypermobility and skin involvement in patients with the Marfan syndrome. A single clinical evaluation, using a standardized protocol, of randomly selected out-patients was made. Joint hypermobility was measured by two scales in wide clinical use (Beighton and Contompasis), skin hyperextensibility was assessed on the dorsum of the hand, and skin thickness and light transmissibility was measured at the same site with a modified Harpenden caliper. The setting was an out-patient medical genetics clinic at an urban teaching hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The subjects comprised 27 children and 48 adults who met strict diagnostic criteria for the Marfan syndrome. In patients less than 18 yr old, 70% had experienced at least one locomotor syndrome, and 40% had had multiple symptoms, of which arthralgia, myalgia and ligamentous injury were the most frequent. Symptoms were absent in children younger than 5 yr. Thereafter, the number of symptoms increased with age. Considerable joint hyperextensibility (> 3/9 of Beighton's criteria) was present in 85%. While one-third had received orthopaedic attention, there had been little if any rheumatological input. In adult patients, locomotor symptoms had occurred in 96%, with 88% having experienced more than one complaint. Spinal pain, arthralgia, ligament injury and fracture were the most common. Most (81%) of the adults had some (> 1/9), and 56% had considerable (> 2/9) evidence of joint hypermobility. Only 20% had received specialist attention for their locomotor symptoms. Skin changes are documented in the Marfan syndrome for the first time in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
