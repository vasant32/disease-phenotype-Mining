This retrospective analysis of a selected series of Bentall-De Bono procedures was carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the Carboseal composite valve graft (Sulzer Carbomedics Inc, Austin, TX, USA). Between October 1997 and April 2004, 120 patients underwent aortic root replacement with the Carboseal Composite Valve Graft. The mean age of patients was 59.7+/-13.4 years (range, 21-83 years); 96 patients (80%) were male. Eighty-nine patients (74.2%) had annulaortic ectasia, 10 patients (8.3%) post-stenotic dilatation, 3 (2.5%) post dissection aneurysm, 2 (1.7%) acute type A dissection and 1 (0.8%) endocarditis. The average follow-up duration was 29.2 months (range 2-82 months). Hospital mortality was 1.7% (2 of 120 patients). The actuarial survival rate (including hospital mortality) was 97.2+/-1.5% at 1 year, 91.6+/-3.5% at 3 years and 84.0+/-8.0% at 5 years. Chronic renal failure was an independent risk factor for late mortality (P=0.02). The actuarial freedom from pseudoaneurysms at 3 years was higher among patients without Marfan syndrome (94.7+/-3.2% vs. 75.0+/-21.6% at 3 years, P<0.003). In our recent series, the Bentall-De Bono operation provided good results with low incidence of prosthetic related complications. Pseudoaneurysms requiring re-operation have a higher incidence among patients with Marfan syndrome.
