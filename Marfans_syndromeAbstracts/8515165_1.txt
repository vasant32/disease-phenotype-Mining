One-staged operation was successfully performed in a 23-year-old female with funnel chest, mitral regurgitation and annulo aortic ectasia secondary to Marfan's syndrome. A midline skin incision was made and the sternum and costal cartilages were mobilized for sternal turnover with rectus muscles pedicle. This procedure offered an excellent operative field, even though the heart and aneurysmal ascending aorta were displaced into the left hemithorax. The combined superior-transseptal approach to the left atrium was used to perform mitral valve replacement. This approach also provided an excellent exposure of the mitral valve. Cabrol's operation was done for annulo aortic ectasia. Our concepts for the operation of open heart surgery complicated with severe funnel chest were discussed.
