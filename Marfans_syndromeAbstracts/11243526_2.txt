We review the cases of two women with acute aortic dissection during their last trimester of pregnancy who underwent aortic root replacement. One patient with type A dissection had to undergo surgical intervention immediately, and required extracorporal membrane oxygenation for four days. The other patient with a pre-diagnosed Marfan's disease had suffered a type B dissection and had to undergo emergency operation after developing a type A dissection nine days later.
