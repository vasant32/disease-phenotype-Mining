A 40-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome had annulo aortic ectasia with Sellers grade 4 aortic valve regurgitation and Wada grade 3 pectus excavatum. Simultaneous operation was successfully performed by aortic valve composite graft insertion and sternal turnover with the rectus muscle pedicles. Following a midline skin incision, the cost-sterno complex (plastron) was dissected together with the bilateral rectus muscle pedicles, and the sternum was divided transversely through the second intercostal space. The plastron with muscle pedicles was retracted away from the anterior chest toward the abdomen and was covered by the moistened sternal bag made of polyethylene to prevent dryness and contamination during the composite graft insertion. The aortic root was replaced with a composite graft consisting of a 25 mm SJM valve and a 26 mm Hemashield graft. A short interposed 10 mm Hemashield graft was inserted between the ostia of the left coronary artery and the composite graft. The right coronary artery was reimplanted in the aortic conduit using the button technique with a doughnut pledget. This one stage method offered excellent operative exposure and enabled us to prevent possible necrosis of the sternum, infection of the mediastinal sinus, and postoperative cardiac failure resulting from chest wall compression. In this procedure, active usage of the rapid autologous transfusion system effectively reduced the total amount of blood transfusion.
