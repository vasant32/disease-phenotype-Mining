Multiple aneurysms are clinically common in population aged over sixty and are caused mainly by atherosclerosis. When occurring in young population other etiologies such as trauma, infections, Bechet's disease, Marfan syndrome, neurofibromatosis or inflammatory disease are responsible for the development of arterial aneurysms. A rare case of multiple aneurysms in a 40-year-old man, affecting the infrarenal part of abdominal aorta, both iliac arteries, common femoral arteries, left femoral superficial and popliteal arteries on, both legs, is reported. The underlying pathology was progressive atherosclerosis, favored by familial hyperlipidemia and excessive cigarette smoking.
