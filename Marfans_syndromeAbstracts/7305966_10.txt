Desmosines from 24 h human urine samples were isolated, characterized and quantified. The desmosines are in peptidyl form (1000--1500 molecular weight), and their amount is decreased by two-thirds between 7 and 25 years of age. Patients with Marfan's syndrome have significantly lower urinary amounts of desmosines than do comparable controls during the early development period.
