The results of treatment of 114 patients, suffering pectus excavatum deformity (PED), in 42 of whom Marfan syndrome was diagnosed, were analyzed. Parasternal chondrotomy of a deformed cartilaginous parts of the ribs with subsequent fixation of their sternal ends towards sternum was used for the symmetric correction. The asymmetric PED correction on a convex side was performed similarly and on a concave one a mobilization effect was achieved, using a multiple notches putting on a cartilaginous parts of the deformed ribs. Good result in the treatment of a symmetric PED was achieved in 52 (81.2%) patients and satisfactory one--in 12 (18.7%), and in asymmetric PED--in 31 (62%) and 16 (32%) accordingly, poor result was noted in 3 (6%) patients. A sufficient efficacy of method of the deformity correction was confirmed by the analysis made on the applied surgical treatment results.
