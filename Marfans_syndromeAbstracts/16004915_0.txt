Many cardiac conditions found in athletes are amenable to athletic participation if well-managed. As always, a respect for the causes of sudden cardiac death in athletes is paramount. Although rare, sudden cardiac death in athletes is frequently preventable by careful pre-participation screening. The authors hope that more athletes will undergo screening, and that basic investigations, including but not limited to electrocardiography, will become more widespread. A high degree of surveillance for cardiac pathology in athletes is the duty of any sports medicine practitioner.
