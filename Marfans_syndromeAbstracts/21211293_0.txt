 OBJECTIVE: To identify FBN1 gene mutations in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: Four affected and two unaffected individuals in the family were recruited after informed consent. Five ml blood samples were drawn from each family member and genomic DNA was extracted. Mutations were detected by directly sequencing to the whole coding region and exon-intron boundaries of FBN1 gene. Polyphen program was used to predict the functional and structural changes of the mutant protein. RESULTS: We found all four affected individuals carried FBN1gene mutations, c.2261A > G (p.Y754C), in exon18 by sequence analysis, while two unaffected family members and 100 normal controls did not have this mutation. A PSIC score of 2.6 was acquired by Polyphen program analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study supports that FBN1 gene mutation, c.2261A > G (p.Y754C), is the underlying molecular pathogenesis of this family with Marfan syndrome. This mutation is identified for the first time in Chinese population.
