A 34-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome complained of redness and pain in the left eye. The right eye had been blind because of untractable retinal detachment. The left eye had had three surgical procedures for retinal detachment, and the lens had been luxated in the vitreous for more than 14 years. Ultrasonography demonstrated the spontaneously luxated lens as the possible cause of the inflammatory reaction. The diagnosis of lens-induced endophthalmitis was confirmed by histopathologic examination of the excised lens.
