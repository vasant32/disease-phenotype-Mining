A 39-year-old patient diagnosed two years previously with Marfan Syndrome (MS) and thoraco-abdominal aneurysm, both presented with the following symptoms: occasional mild effort dyspnea and thoracic pain. The patient started her current illness at 28 weeks of pregnancy with an exacerbation of a deep, oppressive thoracic pain and orthopnea. The echocardiogram showed a 10 cm diameter aortic aneurysm with involvement of the aortic root, tho-racoabdominal and dissection. The computed tomography reported aneurysmatic dilatation of the aortic root and dissection of the thoracic and abdominal portion. Until the delivery of pregnancy the patient was treated successfully with meto-prolol, prazocin, and diuretics. A cesarean section at 29 weeks of pregnancy was practiced.
