Surgical interventions for annulo-aortic ectasia were analyzed and the following conclusions were obtained: 1) In the treatment of annulo-aortic ectasia, Bentall operation is not always the first choice, and satisfactory result can be achieved by either aortic valve replacement (AVR) plus tube graft replacement or AVR plus aneurysmorrhaphy. 2) Bentall operation is indicated to the cases with a) Marfan syndrome, b) aneurysm with thin wall and c) aortic regurgitation from dissection. 3) In the technique using composite graft, wrapping with aneurysmal wall is not always necessary and sinus-shaped composite graft is an advantage to prosthetic valve motion, reducing tension around the coronary artery anastomosis. 4) Aorto-coronary bypass should be combined with Bentall operation in the cases with coronary ostium involved by dissection and displaced coronary ostium.
