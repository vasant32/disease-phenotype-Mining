A 36-year-old male with Marfan syndrome succesfully underwent Bentall operation and aortic arch replacement using a stent graft as an elephant trunk. He had received MVR with sternum turn over 14 years previously. Median sternotomy was performed. Under circulatory arrest with rertograde cerebral perfusion we performed Bentall operation and aortic arch replacement using a stent graft. The sternum was cured well. Retractive breathing was not detected. This surgical procedure was effective for cardiovascular disease with Marfan syndrome.
