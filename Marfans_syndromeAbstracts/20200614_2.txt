Background/Methods. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder usually caused by a mutation in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene. Typical characteristics of MFS that have been described include dolichostenomelia, ectopia lentis and aortic root dilatation. However, there is great clinical variability in the expression of the syndrome's manifestations, both between and within families. Here we discuss the clinical variability of MFS by describing a large fourgeneration Dutch family with MFS.Results. Nineteen individuals of one family with a single missense FBN1 mutation (c.7916A>G) were identified. The same mutation was found in one unrelated person. Clinical variability was extensive and not all mutation carriers fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MFS. Some patients only expressed mild skeletal abnormalities, whereas aortic root dilation was present in eight patients, an acute type A aortic dissection was recorded in two other patients, and a mitral valve prolapse was present in eight patients. In some patients cardiac features were not present on initial screening, but did however develop over time.Conclusion. MFS is a clinically highly variable syndrome, which means a meticulous evaluation of suspected cases is crucial. Mutation carriers should be re-evaluated regularly as cardiovascular symptoms may develop over time. (Neth Heart J 2010;18:85-9.).
