A 27-year-old male whose diagnoses were aortic dissection (Stanford A), aortic regurgitation, annulo-aortic ectasia, and Marfan syndrome underwent modified Bentall operation using composite graft and total arch replacement. Modification of proximal suture without resection of aortic valve like intravalvular implantation might have resulted in good recovery without blood transfusion. Another 63-year-old male who suffered from spontaneous aortic rupture with aortic regurgitation also underwent modified Bentall operation in the similar manner as the first case with good result. Spontaneous aortic rupture reported here is a rare case, and operation is thought to be prerequisite for the patient who suffers from this disease to survive.
