We report a patient with Marfan's syndrome and pectus excavatum who underwent open heart surgery with simultaneous correction of the sternal malformation. Permanent internal stabilization, achieved by bilateral overlapping of the bevelled ends of the lowest ribs and reinforced with sternal closure wires offered a maintained postoperative chest wall stability, avoided the potential postoperative complications of cardiac compression, and improved the aesthetic appearance of the anterior chest wall. The increased risk of bleeding due to extensive dissection was minimized by postponing the repair of pectus excavatum to when protamin is administered after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass.
