 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of aortic valve-sparing repair with glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium in congenital valvular pathology. METHODS: Sixty-two patients underwent reparative aortic valve surgery from January 1997 through December 2003. The mean age was 25 +/- 20 years (+/- standard deviation) (range, 10 days to 81 years). Fifty percent (31 of 62) were less than 19 years old at operation. The diagnoses included bicuspid aortic valve (39 patients), ventricular septal defect (14 patients), severe aortic stenosis (6 patients), subaortic stenosis (7 patients), bacterial endocarditis (7 patients), neonatal truncus arteriosus (2 patients), Shone's complex (2 patients), transposition complex (1 patient), double-chambered right ventricle (1 patient), and Marfan's syndrome (1 patient). Twelve patients (19 %) had prior sternotomy and cardiac operations. Valve-sparing techniques included pericardial leaflet extensions in 62 patients, creation of one or more pericardial neoaortic sinuses in 8, subcommissuroplasty in 8, pericardial patch of perforated leaflets in 9, Dacron mesh wrap (Boston Scientific, Wayne, NJ) of dilated ascending aorta in 12, and concomitant tricuspid and mitral valve repairs in 3 and 4 patients, respectively. RESULTS: There was one early death (1.6%). There were no late deaths at a mean follow-up of 25 +/- 16 (range, 0.1 to 72.5 months). Six patients required reoperation and prosthetic or homograft replacement for aortic valve incompetence. One out of 6 reoperations required re-repair. The remaining patients are well with a mean aortic regurgitation grade by echocardiography of 1.3 +/- 0.9 (scale, 0 to 4). CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve repair with pericardial leaflet extension is a promising technique for the growing child.
