STUDY DESIGN: This is a report of a 31-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome with severe back pain secondary to pedicle fractures of the lumbar spine resulting from attenuation of the pedicles. OBJECTIVES: To report and discuss a case of Marfan syndrome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The authors report the clinical course of a patient with Marfan syndrome and pedicle fractures secondary to thinning of the pedicles. METHODS: After initial diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was confirmed, radiologic techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging and bone scan, were used to evaluate any abnormalities of the lumbar spine. RESULTS: The patient was treated with pain medications and activity modification, which allowed for no marked improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Thinning and possible fracturing of the pedicles should be considered as an etiology of back pain in the patient with Marfan syndrome.
