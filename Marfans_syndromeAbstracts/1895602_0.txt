From March, 1980 to January, 1991, 18 patients, 14 male and 4 female patients ranging in age from 22 to 63 years, were operated on for aortic regurgitation associated with an aneurysm of the ascending aorta. Twelve patients had annuloaortic ectasia; six had DeBakey type I or II dissection; three had Marfan syndrome; and one had aortitis syndrome. The surgical treatment consisted of 16 Bentall operations and 2 modified Cabrol operations with a composite graft and aortic wrapping. The operative mortality was 5.6% (one death). The late mortality has been 4/15. The actuarial survival rate is 82.6% at 5 years and 72.3% at 7 years. Modified Cabrol technique consists of two short interposed grafts with equine pericardial miniskirts between coronary ostia and composite graft, in which Carbomedics mitral valve (No. 23 or 25) is placed 5-10 mm above the proximal extremity. This technique is a safe and reliable method with no bleeding nor mortality and excellent long-term results.
