Valve-sparing aortic root reimplantation with creation of Dacron graft pseudosinuses is a popular and promising surgical choice for annuloaortic ectasia or ascending aortic aneurysm. We have developed a simple modification of the David-V technique, which facilitates free adjustment of the size of the new aortic annulus and the pseudosinus of each patient, as well as the creation of pseudosinuses of excellent shape, with only one Dacron graft.
