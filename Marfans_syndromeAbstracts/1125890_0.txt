A 24-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome and mitral regurgitation had clinical features suggestive of infective endocarditis. The causative organism was Streptococcus viridans. Initial therapy with penicillin G, in a dose that should have been bactericidal and hence curative according to the results of the initial quantitative antimicrobial studies, became inadequate. The strain of S. viridans displayed considerable variation in both growth properties and antimicrobial sensitivity during the course of therapy. In addition, a different strain of S. viridans was cultured 1 month after treatment had begun. It is therefore important to repeat cultures and antimicrobial sensitivity testing during treatment of infective endocarditis.
