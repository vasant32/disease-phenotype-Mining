Aortic root dilatation is rare in children, and is often secondary to Marfan syndrome (MFS). We experienced a case of a three-year-old boy (92 cm, 12 kg) with MFS presenting with progressive dilatation of aortic root. We electively performed a valve-sparing aortic root replacement using a 24-mm Gelweave Valsalva graft. Although the patient required a mitral valve repair due to infective endocarditis postoperatively, the recovery from the second surgery was uneventful. This case is one of the youngest children of valve-sparing aortic root replacement in the literature.
