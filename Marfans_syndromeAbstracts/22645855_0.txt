 BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Marfan patients with aortic root aneurysm are typically treated with the Bentall procedure, though aortic valve-sparing procedures (AVSPs) are also possible. The study aim was to compare the authors' experience with two such techniques performed at their institution, namely a reimplantation according to David (David I) and remodeling according to Yacoub. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2009, a total of 37 Marfan patients underwent an AVSP at the authors' institution. Of these patients, 25 (mean age 32 +/- 14.9 years) underwent surgery according to David (group D), and 12 (mean age 35 +/- 10.9 years) according to Yacoub (group Y). The patients underwent both clinical and echocardiographic follow up examinations at a mean of 42.0 +/- 36.4 months after surgery. RESULTS: One patient from each group had moved abroad and was lost to follow up. The remaining 35 patients were alive at follow up, and none presented with any major neurological or bleeding complications. In addition, no significant differences were noted between the groups in terms of NYHA classification, left ventricular function, or left ventricular diameter. At follow up, aortic valve function was also comparable between groups, with a peak/mean gradient of 9.4 +/- 6.4/5.3 +/- 3.5 mmHg and 5.1 +/- 3.3/2.8 +/- 1.5 mmHg for groups D and Y, respectively (p = 0.081/0.058). The measured mean grades of aortic valve regurgitation were comparable in groups D and Y (0.6 +/- 0.7 and 1.1 +/- 0.6, respectively; p = 0.055). However, aortic root dimensions obtained via M-mode were smaller in group D patients (29.6 +/- 2.3 mm) than in group Y patients (36.1 +/- 6.6 mm) (p = 0.027). Only three patients from group Y required reoperation on the aortic valve due to valvular regurgitation (p = 0.028); two of these had presented with aortic dissection at the first operation. CONCLUSION: Both types of AVSP can be performed with comparably good interim clinical results, and also low mortality and morbidity, in patients with Marfan syndrome.
