A patient with Marfan's syndrome and previous Bentall repair for aortic dissection required orthotopic cardiac transplantation for end-stage cardiomyopathy. Postoperatively he suffered recurrent aortic dissection involving the transverse and descending aorta leading to tracheal and esophageal compression. He underwent successful surgical replacement of his ascending aorta, transverse arch, and descending aorta.
