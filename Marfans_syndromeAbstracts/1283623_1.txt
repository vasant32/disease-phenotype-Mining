An aneurysm of the internal carotid artery associated with Marfan's syndrome occurred in a 23-year-old female with a 2-year history of a pulsating lesion in the left neck, which progressively increased in size. Left carotid angiography demonstrated a giant saccular aneurysm at the origin of the internal carotid artery. The aneurysm was excised and end-to-end anastomosis performed without postoperative morbidity.
