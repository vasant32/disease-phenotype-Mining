The paper deals with hemorrhagic stroke (HS) pathogenesis and diagnosis in young people. Among cerebrovascular diseases in the young acute hemorrhagic strokes take noticeable place. Arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcoholism are among risk factors of subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH). Massive hemorrhages occur in the rupture of arterial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. HS in the young may be caused by blood diseases, i.e. leukemias, hemophilias, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, coagulopathies; vasculitis in diffuse diseases of the connective tissue; non-inflammatory arteriopathies; drug addiction. Genetic predisposition to HS development is discussed with focus to such diseases as a family form of moya-moya disease, glucocorticoid-depressed hyperaldosteronism, elastic pseudoxanthoma, Marfan's syndrome, renal olycystosis, Sturge-Veber syndrome. It is recommended to use wider updated methods of neurovisualization (CT, MRT, angiography) in diagnosis of HS. The conclusion is made that HS diagnosis, especially in the young, needs a multidisciplinary approach with active participation of neurologist, neurosurgeon, therapist, endocrinologist, hematologist.
