Simultaneous surgical interventions on the aorta and valvular system of the heart were performed in four patients presenting with aortic dissections and aneurysms conditioned by Marfan's syndrome. The following reconstructive operations were carried out: 1) prosthetic repair of the aortic valve and the ascending portion of the aorta by means of a valve-containing conduit with replantation of the openings of the coronary arteries into the side of the prosthesis according to the Benthall - De Bono technique, annuloplasty of the tricuspid valve according to the De Vega technique, valvuloplasty of the mitral valve by the Alferi technique; 2) grafting of the aortic valve and the ascending portion of the aorta by means of a valve-containing conduit with replantation of the openings of the coronary arteries according to the Kabrol's technique, plasty of the tricuspid valve by the De Vega technique; 3) prosthetic repair of the aortic arch with distal wedge-like excision of the membrane of the dissection and directing the blood flow along the both channels, plasty of the mitral valve, plasty of the aortic valve and the ascending portion of the aorta with a valve-containing conduit, accompanied by replantation of the openings of the coronary arteries into the side of the graft according to the Benthall - De Bono technique; (4) plasty of the mitral valve with a disk graft through the fibrous ring of the aortic valve, prosthetic repair of the aortic valve and the ascending portion of the aorta with a valve-containing conduit, accompanied by replantation of the openings of the coronary arteries into the side according to the Benthall-De Bono technique.
