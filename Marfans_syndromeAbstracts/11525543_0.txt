A patent distal false lumen after repair of type A aortic dissection often poses serious late complications. We present a successful repair of dissecting aortic aneurysm through left thoracotomy, extending from the ascending to descending thoracic aorta after composite graft replacement of the aortic root. Although staged operations, including the elephant trunk procedure, are usually chosen for remaining extensive aortic disease after replacement of the aortic root or the ascending aorta, a single-stage repair from the ascending to the descending thoracic aortas through left thoracotomy can be a favorable option to treat a patient with this type of aortic disease.
