The paper concerns the results of clinical trials of new specialized foods--protein, defatted and fat enpits as well as low lactose milk mixtures, which were used in dietotherapy of sick children with different disease entities (hypothrophy, bronchopulmonary abnormalities, emaciation pre- and postoperatively, mucoviscidosis, Laurence-Moon-Bardte-Biedle's syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, galactosemia, lactase deficiency). The diets including new therapeutic foods were shown to exert high therapeutic effects, that gave grounds for the methodological recommendations for using them in pediatrics to be given.
