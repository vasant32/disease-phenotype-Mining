 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although historically Marfan syndrome (MFS) has always been considered as a condition caused by the deficiency of a structural extracellular matrix protein, fibrillin-1, the study of Marfan mouse models and Marfan-related conditions has shifted our current understanding to a pathogenic model that involves dysregulation of the cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we focus on the impact of the revised MFS clinical diagnostic criteria. We discuss lessons that have been learned from molecular findings in relevant Marfan-related conditions, such as sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection, stiff skin syndrome, acromelic dysplasias and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We explore the latest insights into the role of the alternative TGF-β signaling pathways in MFS pathogenesis. Finally, we give an update on the current and future treatment strategies. SUMMARY: The recent insights into the pathogenesis of MFS and related disorders have offered a prime example of translational medicine with immediate bridge between molecular findings and therapeutic options.
