Pericarditis was the primary manifestation of aortic dissection in these 2 young men. Both patients had no phenotypic characteristics of Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These patients had pleuritic chest pain and characteristic electrocardiographic changes consistent with pericarditis. However, timely performed transthoracic echocardiograms revealed proximal aortic dissection with hemopericardium noted at surgery in both cases. Although the sensitivity of transthoracic echocardiogram for proximal aortic dissection is approximately 60%, certain findings can alert the physician to the possibility of aortic dissection. Therefore, in young patients with suspected pericarditis, a timely performed transthoracic echocardiogram should include a careful evaluation of the ascending aorta and arch to rule out this lethal diagnosis.
