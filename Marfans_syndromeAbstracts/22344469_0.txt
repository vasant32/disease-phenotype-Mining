 PURPOSE: We report a case of woman with Marfan syndrome and longstanding postlensectomy scleral wound dehiscence. METHODS: A 34-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome who underwent lensectomy 20 years ago had conjunctival leakage with chronic hypotony and conjunctival cystic degeneration secondary to scleral wound dehiscence. Presentation, clinical evaluation, and particular treatment with autologous cultivated conjunctival epithelium transplantation and scleral patch graft are described. RESULTS: A 6-month follow-up confirmed complete epithelization of the ocular surface and absence of leaking from the wound with normal intraocular pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of autologous cultivated conjunctival epithelium appears to be a valid strategy in the treatment of ocular disease requiring extensive excision of the conjunctiva.
