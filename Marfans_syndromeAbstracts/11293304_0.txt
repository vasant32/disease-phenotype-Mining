The bibliographic research online is an useful means of recovering information in all the subjects, particularly in the field of biomedicine. In fact, this instrument allows researchers to get information in a rapid, complete and up-to-date way. The aim of the present review is to describe the usefulness of the bibliographical research online in the field of the genetic osteopathies. These are rare disorders: so, their own rarity makes the bibliographical research online necessary to carry out a large and effective comparison of experiences. The obtained results are amply reported in the manuscript. For instance, we verified that chondrodysplasias are the diseases most represented in the literature, while melorheostosis the disorder less mentioned. Moreover, we evidenced that some hereditary disorders of connective tissue, such as Marfan's syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, are strongly influenced by race, sex and age.
