We report on a 46-year-old man with a 4-year history of predominantly nocturnal pain at the thoracic and lumbar spine as well as accompanying morning stiffness and episodes of alternating buttock pain. At physical examination the patient presented with the typical traits for Marfan's syndrome (MFS), along with limitation of both chest expansion and movement in all planes of the lumbar spine. Pelvic and lumbar spine radiographs showed findings consistent with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Laboratory tests were consistent with an inflammatory state and HLA typing was positive for the B27 antigen. Transthoracic echocardiography showed prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet and mild aortic insufficiency. We diagnosed co-existent MFS and AS. The association of these two pathologies is particularly interesting, owing to the co-existence of hypermobility of peripheral joints due to MFS ligamentous hyperlaxity, and the reduction of both axial skeleton motility and chest expansion related to AS. As both of these diseases may damage the cardiovascular system over time, follow-up with echocardiography monitoring is indispensable.
