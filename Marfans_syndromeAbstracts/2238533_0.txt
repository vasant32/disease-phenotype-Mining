Relative synthesis of collagen was studied in skin fibroblasts of children with funnel chest and of corresponding age children (control) in presence of ascorbic acid. In presence of ascorbic acid the rate of collagen synthesis was 2-2.4-fold lower that in corresponding controls both in proliferating and stationary cultures. At the same time, relative synthesis of collagen was quite similar both in the patient and control fibroblasts in presence of ascorbic acid. Estimation of the 14C-Hypro/14C-Pro ratio in collagens isolated from cultural media showed that there was no difference in the hydroxylation rate of collagens in control and patient fibroblasts. These data suggest that funnel chest is one of the forms of systemic connective tissue diseases, which impaired mainly the cartilages.
