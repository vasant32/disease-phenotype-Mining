We report an 18-year old patient with hypochromic anaemia and subfebriles states and long-persisting despite symptomatic treatment. On admission he presented body proportions similar to Marfan syndrome. Hypochromic anaemia and positive inflammatory markers were present along with negative results of serologic and microbiological assays. Hormonal parameters, as well as karyotype were normal. Among several imagining procedures, ultrasound and CT of the abdomen revealed areas in the spleen suggestive of proliferative disease or abscesses. Bone marrow examination was normal. Because of high probability of the disease limited to the spleen and deteriorating clinical state of the patient, splenectomy was performed. After the operation significant improvement of the health state of the patient was observed. Histopathological evaluation showed splenic abscesses. However, anamnesis and accessory examinations did not reveal their etiology. This report is an example of possible difficulties in diagnosing splenic abscesses, as well as supports grounds for surgical intervention in chosen cases.
