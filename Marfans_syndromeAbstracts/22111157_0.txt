The majority of cases of sudden, unexpected death in athletes are related to cardiovascular anomalies. Some of these anomalies may be diagnosed with a preparticipation examination including a thorough history of previous symptoms that would suggest a cardiovascular diagnosis. In addition, a complete and thorough family history should be obtained, not only from the athlete but also from the athlete's parents. If any family members have the diagnosis of HCM or prolonged Q-T syndrome, a history of sudden, unexpected death, or have used a pacemaker, this should be a possible clue for diagnosis. Once a cardiovascular diagnosis is made, the athlete should be subject to the accepted guidelines for participation in athletics and competitive sports.
