A 63-year-old woman with aneurysm of the ascending aorta associated with AR due to dilatation of the sinotubular junction (STJ) and with poor LV function, who did not have Marfan syndrome, underwent a plication of the STJ and replacement of the ascending aorta. In operation, we simultaneously performed the plication of dilated STJ (60 mm) and the replacement of ascending aorta using a 26 mm Woven Dacron graft. Post-operative angiogram (1 POM) showed no aortic regurgitation and good recovery of the LV function. This procedure is less invasive, and indicated for patients without significant elongation or thickening of the aortic valve, especially when the patients have higher risk.
