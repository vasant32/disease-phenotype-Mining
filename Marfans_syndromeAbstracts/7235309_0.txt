Marfan's syndrome is classified as a heritable disorder of connective tissue in which the supporting structure is involved in clinical and pathologic alterations. In its classic form the syndrome is associated with abnormalities of the eye, aorta, and the skeleton. Conduction disturbances and ventricular arrhythmias have rarely been described in this syndrome. In this brief case report a patient with symptomatic heart block, prolonged atrial-His interval and ventricular arrhythmia in whom a permanent ventricular pacemaker has been implanted, is described.
