We present a case of a left subclavian artery aneurysm in a 48-year-old man with Marfan syndrome. Aneurysms of the subclavian artery are rare in patients with Marfan syndrome. Resection of the aneurysm and interposition with a synthetic graft were performed through a supra- and infraclavicular incision, without resecting the clavicle. Histological findings were compatible with Marfan syndrome. In patients with Marfan syndrome, regular follow-up is important because of the occurrence of peripheral aneurysms other than the aorta.
