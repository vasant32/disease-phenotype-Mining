A 32-year-old man with Marfan syndrome presented with enlarging, asymptomatic bilateral subclavian artery aneurysms. He has an extensive surgical history including aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta replacement. The L aneurysm was treated first with an L carotid-vertebral artery vein bypass, aneurysm debranching, and stent-graft repair of aneurysm via the L brachial artery approach. The R aneurysm was treated by placing a stent graft from the proximal R common carotid artery across the R subclavian artery origin and landing in the prosthetic innominate bypass graft via an L common carotid artery conduit. An aneurysm debranching and R carotid-subclavian artery bypass completed the procedure. A proximal type I endoleak was detected in the R aneurysm sac on follow-up computed tomography angiography. This was treated with sternotomy, aorta to L common carotid artery bypass, stent graft removal, and oversewing of the R subclavian artery origin. The patient recovered uneventfully. Subclavian artery aneurysms are rarely diagnosed in patients with Marfan disease. Although durability remains unproven, hybrid repair should be considered in patients with subclavian artery aneurysms, to minimize the morbidity commonly associated with open repair.
