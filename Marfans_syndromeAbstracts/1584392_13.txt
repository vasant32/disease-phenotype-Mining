An unusual anterior sacral meningocele associated with Marfan's syndrome, with demonstrated dural anomalies related to Marfan's syndrome is reported. Endoscopy enabled complete exploration of the meningocele, its morphological description, and ultimate cure. The meningocele resembled an hourglass made up of intrasacral and anterior sacral components. The communication of this bilobed malformation with the dural sac was so small that only the intrathecal injection of a colored solution allowed its localization. The closure of this communication was accomplished under endoscopic view by a single stitch. The postoperative course of the patient was characterized by immediate disappearance of the preoperative clinical signs. Computed tomographic scans demonstrated progressive complete collapse of the anterior sacral meningocele and partial resolution of the intrasacral component. Dural anomalies of Marfan's syndrome are described, and their relationship to the formation of the meningocele is discussed.
