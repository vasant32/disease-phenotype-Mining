The Achard syndrome is a well-defined clinical entity consisting of widespread dysostoses and increased ligament laxity. The bony involvement appears most consistently in the tubular bones of the hands and feet, the mandible and the calvarium, but may also be noted elsewhere in the body. Hypermobility and subluxations of the joints, increased lateral excursion of the patellas and other findings reflect the increased ligament laxity.
