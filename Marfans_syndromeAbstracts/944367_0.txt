A case is described in which false aneurysm of the ascending aorta developed following corrective surgery for Marfan's syndrome. During the initial procedure, a dissecting aortic aneurysm and incompetent aortic valve were managed by replacing the valve with a Starr-Edwards prosthesis and the ascending aorta with a woven Dacron aortic prosthesis. Two years later the operation was repeated with the use of antibiotic cover, because the patient developed a paraprosthetic leak following subacute bacterial endocarditis with Staphylococcus aureus. The woman remained well for 6 months, after which she developed a false aneurysm of the ascending aorta and aortic incompetence which necessitated repeating the operation for a third time. The patient remains well one year later. Relevant literature available on false aneurysm of the ascending aorta is also reviewed.
