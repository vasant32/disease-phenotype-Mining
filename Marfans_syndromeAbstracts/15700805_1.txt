There was investigated one of the mechanisms of adaptive response, related to chromosome aberrations induced by gamma-rays, in lymphocytes of healthy donors and donors with hereditary diseases (Marfan's syndrome and homocystinurea) whose cells are repair-deficient. 3H-thymidine treatment was used as an adaptive dose in G1-period of cell cycle and 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), activated with UV-light, was used as a challenge agents. Cells of healthy donors and cells of patients with Marfan's syndrome had normal adaptive response in relation to gamma-irradiation and photomutagenic action of 8-MOP. There was no induction of adaptive response in realation to gamma-irradiation and 8-MOP photomutagenic action in cells of patients with homocystinurea. The cells from donors characterised with normal repair system and lack of adaptive response 8-MOP photomutagenic action wasn't modified by 3H-thymidine. We have found parallelism of adaptive response protective effect against chromosome aberrations, induced by UV activated 8-MOP and gamma-rays in repair proficient cells of healthy donors and repair deficient cells of patients with Marfan's syndrome. These data lead us to conclusion that mechanism of adaption, at least in some cases has no connection with repair process modification.
