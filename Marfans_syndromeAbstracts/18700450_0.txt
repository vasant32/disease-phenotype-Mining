Connective tissues disorders are various and characterized by skin hyperelasticity, joint hypermobility and easy bruising. Ocular abnormalities predominate in type VI Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan disease, brittle cornea, Lobstein syndrome. We report three cases of patients with presumed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The diagnosis was clinical and could be confirmed by histological findings in two cases. We expose various ocular involvements in this syndrome and insist that biochemical tests are helpful to make the diagnosis.
