A 44-year-old male with Marfan's disease presented acutely with severe chest and left groin pain. A pulsatile mass was present in the left groin and the left leg was pale and pulseless. CT imaging demonstrated the presence of a distal thoracic aortic dissection (AD) involving the left iliofemoral segment with extravasation of contrast into the left groin. The patient was treated with an urgent femoral-femoral bypass, which repaired the femoral artery and restored perfusion to the left lower extremity. Whereas rupture of the aorta into the chest or pericardium is common, femoral artery rupture complicating AD has not been previously reported. This case illustrates the need for peripheral branch intervention when compromised by the dissection process including isolated iliofemoral segments, which are typically benign. Given frank femoral artery rupture, urgent surgical repair was required and resulted in a satisfactory outcome.
