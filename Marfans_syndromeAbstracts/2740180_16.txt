The cardiovascular manifestations of the Marfan syndrome in older children and adults have been well described. Clinical, radiographic, and echocardiographic data regarding three patients with severe perinatal Marfan syndrome are described. Two of these patients had the syndrome at birth and died in infancy. The syndrome was diagnosed in the third patient at 6 months of age and the child is still alive at 3 years of age. The possible relationship among the Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta is considered. Patients with Marfan syndrome and severe cardiorespiratory problems early in life tend to have a limited life expectancy.
