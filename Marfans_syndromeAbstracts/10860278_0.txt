OBJECTIVE: The treatment of annuloaortic ectasia in patients, including those with Marfan syndrome, ascending aortic dissection, and other disorders of the ascending aorta and aortic valve presents a surgical challenge that has, unfortunately, shown high hospital mortality up to now. Improvements in graft materials and advanced surgical techniques have, however, begun to reduce hospital mortality. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 47 consecutive patients who undergoing aortic root reconstruction using the Carrel patch between January 1991 and March 1999. RESULTS: Postoperative complications included myonephrotic metabolic syndrome caused by femoral artery cannulation in 2 patients. Reexploration was done to halt bleeding in 2 patients. In 1 of 4 acute dissection patients, retrograde filling of the false lumen was demonstrated postoperatively. Overall surgical mortality in this series was 2.1% (1 of 47). The cardiac-event free rate was 98% at 5 years and 88% at 8 years. Actual survival is 97.8% at 8 years. No anastomosis complications were seen during follow-up (average: 32.7 months) (about 2.73 years). CONCLUSION: Surgery is considered feasible in any anatomic variation of aortic root disease, even in coronary ostial minimal dislocation, and the Carrel patch holds hope in preventing of anastomotic pseudaneurysm and ensuring long-term survival. Our experience suggests that modified Bentall operation, or aortic root remodeling using the Carrel patch, has few late-term complications, even in Marfan patients.
