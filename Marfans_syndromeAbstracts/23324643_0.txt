Described herein is a variant of surgical treatment of a patient presenting with type A aortic dissection extending to the brachiocephalic branches accompanied by thrombosis of the false channel of the latter. In the rare cases in dissection and thrombosis of the brachiocephalic branches for adequate protection of the body (systemic protection) it is necessary to use bidirectional arterial perfusion under the conditions of moderate hyperthermia: through a preliminarily sewn into the carotid artery prosthesis - perfusion of the brain, through cannulated aortic arch or femoral artery - body perfusion.
