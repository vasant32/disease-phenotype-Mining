Chronic isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) caused by degenerative, rheumatic, and Marfan etiologies were compared in a study of 87 patients. There were three hospital deaths in the Marfan group, but none in the rheumatic and degenerative groups. The late postoperative survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 98% and 94%, respectively, in the rheumatic group; 84% and 84%, respectively, in the degenerative group; and 85% and 78%, respectively, in the Marfan group. An analysis of the late complications disclosed a higher incidence of aortic dissection and paravalvular leakage in the degenerative and Marfan groups than in the rheumatic group. In the degenerative group, 4 of the 32 patients developed acute aortic dissection within 3 years following aortic valve replacement. The aortic root diameter in these 4 patients was more than 40 mm at the time of surgery, whereas it was less than 40 mm in the remaining 28 patients. In conclusion, considering the progressive nature of myxomatous degeneration, patients with a severely dilated aortic root diameter should be monitored carefully with echocardiography after surgery.
