A case of acute aortic dissection Stanford Type A occurring in a patient with Marfan's syndrome, complicated with aortic regurgitation and severe pectus excavatum, is reported with successful surgical correction. The patient was a 33-year-old woman, who suffered from severe back pain riding to work. An emergency operation consisting of Cabrol's procedure for aortic dissection Stanford Type A and sternal turnover for pectus excavatum was performed simultaneously. Because of the postoperative mediastinal bleeding the implanted sterno-costal complex was removed on the second POD and the prosthetic sternum was reimplanted on the tenth POD. The two-stage operation seems preferable in such an emergency case to avoid postoperative bleeding and infection.
