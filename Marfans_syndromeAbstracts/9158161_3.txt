We retrospectively studied the experience of our institution with isolated dysplasia of one or both atrio-ventricular valves in 22 newborn infants. All patients with associated cardiac malformations were excluded. Ten patients exhibited isolated tricuspid valve dysplasia. One patient had tricuspid valve dysplasia and a dysplastic pulmonary valve. In 10 patients, both atrio-ventricular valves were affected. Finally, mitral valve dysplasia was associated with pulmonary valve stenosis in 1 case. Associated syndromes and/or chromosomal anomalies were: Down syndrome (n=2), trisomy 18 (n=1), Noonan syndrome (n=1), Marfan syndrome (n=3), Ehlers-Danlos and Cutis laxa (n=2). Mortality was 27.2% during follow-up (mean 51 months): 3 patients with chromosomal aneuploidies, 2 patients with severe neonatal Marfan syndrome and 1 with Ehlers-Danlos. Complications were: sustained supra-ventricular tachycardia in 3, neonatal staphylococcal tricuspid valve endocarditis in 1, persistent significant valvular disease in 8. In the remaining 9 survivors, the dysplasia of the atrio-ventricular valves persists with absent or mild incompetence. Beside obvious chromosomal anomalies, newborn infants with dysplastic valves should be investigated for manifestations of connective tissue disorders. This may help to identify new pleiotropic syndromes which include valvular dysplasia as one manifestation.
