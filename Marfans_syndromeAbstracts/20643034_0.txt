To report a technique to maintain pelvic flow to an internal iliac artery (IIA) with aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome, and previously treated by infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm open procedure. Retrograde endovascular hypogastric artery preservation (REHAP) through flexible endograft implantation from external iliac artery (EIA) to internal iliac artery (IIA) was used. REHAP was a reasonable, minimally invasive and elegant alternative (new) to maintain pelvic arterial flow in Marfan syndrome. However, the long-term durability is unknown, and so, it should be used in selected patients.
