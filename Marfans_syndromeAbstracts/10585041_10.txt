BACKGROUND: This analysis was performed to evaluate the results of reoperations on the ascending aorta and aortic root. METHODS: All reoperations (n = 134) on the aortic root and ascending aorta performed between February 1981 and April 1998 were retrospectively analyzed. Indications for reintervention were a true or false aneurysm (35%), acute dissection (3.0%), aortic valve stenosis and/or insufficiency (23.1%), prosthetic valve endocarditis (32.8%), and combinations (4.5%). The principal reoperations performed were aortic root replacement (composite graft, freestyle, aortic allograft, or pulmonary autograft) in 116 patients, ascending aortic replacement in 10 patients, and closure of a false aneurysm in 5 patients. Results were analyzed using univariate statistical methods. RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 6.6% (8 patients). Univariate predictors of hospital death were preoperative functional class III or IV (p = 0.02), an interval of less than 6 months between the primary and actual operation (p = 0.02), preoperative creatinine level of more than 200 micromol/L (p = 0.001), acute aortic dissection (p = 0.001), intraoperative technical problems (p = 0.001), and postoperative dialysis (p = 0.001). Freedom from repetitive reoperation was 99% at 1 year and 98% at 5 and 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations on the aortic root and ascending aorta can be performed with an early mortality which is very acceptable.
