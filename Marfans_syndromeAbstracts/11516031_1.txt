BACKGROUND: Patients who underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with a prosthetic graft for treatment of ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection between January 1992 and December 2000 were studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bentall's operation, using a composite aortic valve and prosthetic graft. was performed in 82 patients (70 males). Indications for the procedure included ascending aortic aneurysm (n=54 including 16 patients with Marfan's syndrome): DeBakey Type I or II aortic dissection (n=26 including 10 patients with Marfan's syndrome) and ascending aortic aneurysm with severe aortic stenosis (bicuspid aortic valve disease) (n=2). Bentall's procedure with the inclusion technique was performed in 72 patients and a Cabrol fistula created in 63 patients. In 10 other patients, coronary button transfer was done without a Cabrol fistula. There were 6 early deaths (7.3%) and 8 patients required re-exploration for excessive bleeding. Eighteen patients showed low cardiac output while the wound of 8 became infected. Postoperative arrhythmia and renal failure was seen in 26 and 6 patients, respectively. Four patients had pericardial effusion. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 8 years. There were 8 late deaths, the causes of which include congestive heart failure (n=3). cerebral hemorrhage (n=3) and sudden cardiac death (n=2). Two patients reported back with dissection of the descending thoracic aorta and await surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Bentall's operation is a safe procedure with an acceptable mortality and morbidity.
