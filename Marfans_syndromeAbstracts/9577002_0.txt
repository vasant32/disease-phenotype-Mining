From 1986 to 1996, 20 patients underwent aortic root replacement. All of the patients had annulo aortic ectasia (AAE); Six had DeBakey type I aortic dissection, three were acute dissections associated with Marfan's syndrome; three had previously undergone the Koster-Collins operation. During 11 years, the original Bentall procedure (1986-91), the Cabrol procedure (1991-), and the modified Bentall procedure (Carrel patch or Piehler technique) were performed. There was only 1 hospital mortality (5.0%). Four patients died during the follow-up period (mediastinitis, myocardial infarction, cerebral bleeding, and rupture of the arch aneurysm). Only 2 patients required reoperation (repair of a pseudoaneurysm of the right coronary artery and paravalvular leakage of the aortic valve replacement). The satisfactory outcomes were the result of the full-thickness anastomoses performed during coronary artery reconstruction.
