Although prophylactic composite graft repair of the aortic root contributes considerably to increased survival in patients with the Marfan syndrome, a high frequency of early and late postoperative complications has been reported.  A relatively unknown postoperative complication is coronary ostial aneurysm.  Better survival rates as a result of improved surgical techniques and developments in new imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography, have resulted in increased findings of coronary ostial aneurysms.  The prevalence and clinical importance of coronary ostial aneurysms are not yet known. The present study was undertaken to analyze the prevalence of coronary ostial aneurysms in patients with Marfan&#x2019;s syndrome after elective aortic root replacement.
