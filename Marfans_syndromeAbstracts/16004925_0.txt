The number of preventable sports eye injuries resulting in permanent vision loss remains unacceptably high. Convincing athletes to use protective eyewear for sports is challenging, but worth the effort. Regardless, injuries still occur, and they must be diagnosed and treated promptly. Maintaining the skills necessary to perform a good fundoscopic examination will help to methodically work through the differential diagnoses. Cultivating a working relationship with an ophthalmologist and feeling comfortable consulting with him is always beneficial when an obvious cause of vision loss is not apparent. Although the majority of ophthalmologic issues in athletes can be managed well in the training room setting, always maintain a high level of vigilance for rarer and more serious ophthalmologic pathologies.
