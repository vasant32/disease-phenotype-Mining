45 patients with an age of 3--15.5 yr are reported. Only 9 of them showed symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue). The murmur was often uncharacteristic, only 42% had a click. ECG changes could be found in 60%. The associated cardiac lesions and the angiographic findings are represented. Correlating to an angiocardiographically LVOTO we found in 13 patients (28.9%) the echocardiographic signs of an ASH with a septum/LV posterior wall quotient of 1.45 +/- 0.15. We conclude, that myocardial disease is one pathogenetic factor in the MVPS.
