We report the case of a Japanese boy whose dysmorphic features were consistent with those of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. The radiological features were characterized by late-onset craniosynostosis, arachnodactyly, undermodeling of short tubular bones, mildly undermodeled and slightly bowed long bones, twisted ribs and tall vertebral bodies with elongated neural arches. Apart from the craniosynostosis, these skeletal changes resembled those of frontometaphyseal dysplasia, a well-known craniotubular dysplasia. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome also shares many clinical features with frontometaphyseal dysplasia.
