We experienced two cases of the thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms with Marfan's syndrome. Case 1; The 31 year-old-woman was operated upon by Crawford's procedure, which includes reconstruction of renal arteries, superior mesenteric artery, and celiac artery using temporary shunt. Although she had been well for three years after the operation before she developed acute aortic dissection, she could not tolerate the Bentall's procedure on it. Case 2; The 37 year-old woman was operated upon for dissecting aneurysm (DeBakey IIIb). The procedure included replacement of the descending and abdominal aorta by Dacron graft. Four years after the operation, enlargement of residual false lumen had been observed, which caused its dehiscence just proximal to the abdominal aortic anastomosis. The Crawford's procedure, which includes reconstruction of renal arteries, superior mesenteric artery, and celiac artery using temporary shunt was employed for repair of the remaining thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. She is well now 5 months after surgery. We conclude that cardiovascular changes in patients with Marfan's syndrome must be observed carefully because of its high recurrent rate after initial surgery. The operation at proper time and a careful observation of cardiovascular changes will improve the prognosis.
