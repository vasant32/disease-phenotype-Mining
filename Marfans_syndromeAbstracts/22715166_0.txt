An Asian male in his late 50s with known Marfan's syndrome (MFS) presented with sudden deterioration in vision and loss of globe structure 13 years after the placement of a silicone scleral encircling band for the management of retinal detachment. Surgical exploration revealed simultaneous intrusion and extrusion of the encircling band resulting in globe perforation and collapse. This was managed by removal of the encircling band and a scleral patch graft over the defect. This case highlights that in patients with thin sclera, such as in MFS, scleral perforation is a potential complication that should be considered in patients undergoing scleral buckling. Management of this complication is also technically difficult because of impaired healing of the sclera in these patients.
