 BACKGROUND: Aortic root dilation, dissection and rupture are major clinical problems in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Although β-blockers remain the standard of preventive treatment, preliminary results from animal studies and a selected group of severely affected MFS children show significant benefit from treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker with TGF-β inhibiting potential. Large-scale human trials are now needed to confirm these results. This trial aims to evaluate the combined effect of both drugs. METHODS: We are conducting a prospective randomized placebo controlled double blind phase III study aiming to include 174 MFS patients (age ≥ 10 years and z-score ≥ 2). Patients already taking β-blockers are randomized for weight-adjusted treatment with losartan versus placebo. The primary endpoint is decrease in aortic root growth rate. Secondary endpoints are aortic dissection/surgery, progression of aortic/mitral regurgitation, arterial stiffness, left ventricular systolic/diastolic function, quality of life and genetic modifiers. Echocardiography, vascular echo-Doppler and quality of life assessment will be performed at baseline and at 6-monthly follow-ups for 3 years. MRI evaluation will be performed at baseline and at the end of the trial. CONCLUSION: This trial will study new therapeutic strategies for the prevention of serious cardiovascular complications in MFS. The uniqueness in our trial is that the additive effect of losartan and β-blocker will be evaluated in a large spectrum of disease severity. A combination of ultrasound and MRI will allow detailed evaluation of anatomic and functional properties of the aorta and left ventricle.
