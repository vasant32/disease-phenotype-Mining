This review has summarized the more important diseases that may be accompanied by or lead to a disorder of hemostasis or thrombosis via alterations of the vasculature. It is to be stressed that the vascular component of hemostasis is often overlooked by clinicians caring for patients with disorders of hemostasis and thrombosis. It should be appreciated that the vasculature is intricately related to the coagulation protein system and to platelets when involved in thrombohemorrhagic diatheses. Although many vascular disorders may lead to hemorrhage or thrombosis, it must be appreciated that often it is impossible to discern between a primary vascular defect/damage and a defect that has been induced by platelet activation/dysfunction or procoagulant abnormalities.
