The radioadaptive response was assessed by the chromosome aberration test in lymphocytes of humans with hereditary diseases of connective tissue, which were earlier characterized as repair-deficient: Marfan syndrome (SM), Elers-Danlos syndrome (E-D), and homocystinurea (HCU). The radioadaptive response was observed in cells of patients with Marfan syndrome and Elers-Danlos syndrome but not in cells of patients with homocystinurea. Parameters of cell protection against gamma-irradiation at radioadaptive response were similar to those obtained in cells pretreated with interferon. These data indicate, first, the possibility that repair pathways and the radioadaptive response are independent and second, that there are common pathways of protection upon radioadaptive response and the antimutagenic action of interferon.
