A 56-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome was scheduled for a valve-sparing aortic root replacement operation because of annuloaortic ectasia and aortic regurgitation. He had severe dyspnea. When the operation started, SpO2 decreased at the time of the median sternotomy, and increased by manual inflation. After sternal closure, PIP increased from 20 cmH2O to 28 cmH2O, SpO2 decreased from 98% to 66%, and the expiratory pattern indicated airway obstruction. Because hypoxemia persisted, we reopened the sternum, resulting in increased SpO2 and decreased PIP, but hypercapnea remained. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a narrowing of the tracheal and bronchial lumen. We suspected tracheobronchomalacia, and the tracheal tube was advanced to just above the carina. We succeeded in extubating 7 days after the operation. Since he had severe persisting dyspnea, we suggested reopening the partial sternum to decompress the intrathoracic pressure, and closing the skin. The sternum was reopened, and he had no dyspnea after the second operation. The mechanism of tracheobronchomalacia is considered to be related to the connective tissue defect of Marfan's syndrome. Suddenly SpO2 is decreased and PIP and Et(CO2) are increased after closure of the sternum. Bronchoscopy was useful in making the diagnosis.
