Thirty-two patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) underwent detailed ophthalmologic examination in order to detect the ocular abnormalities associated with this disorder. Three patients had Marfan's syndrome, and 29 had no associated systemic disorders. Of the latter, 19 (65.5%) were myopic (average, 2.00 diopters), 12 (41.4%) had lenticular opacities, and all had unusually deep anterior-chamber angles with prominent iris processes. None of the 29 patients had subluxated lenses. These findings support the view that MVP syndrome can be considered a generalized connective tissue disorder different from Marfan's syndrome.
