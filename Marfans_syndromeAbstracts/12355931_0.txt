A 21-year-old female patient with Marfan's syndrome suffering from chronic ascending aortic dissection and aortic insufficiency was treated with total aortic root replacement by Cabrol technique (or procedure). The post-operative course was smooth and the patient recovered satisfactorily with very stable hemodynamic condition and good appetite. Unfortunately she complained of sudden severe abdominal pain followed by complete anuria on the fifth post-operative day. The MRI demonstrated abdominal aortic dissection with malperfusion of all the abdominal organs. Rapid increase of aminotransferases (SGOT and SGPT), severe acidosis and rapid deterioration of vital signs within 10 hours discouraged us from trying surgical intervention. The puzzle of management in those cases will be discussed.
