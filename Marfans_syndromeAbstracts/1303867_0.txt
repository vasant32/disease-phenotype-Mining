Traditional surgical management of subluxated lenses is usually associated with a high incidence of operative and postoperative complication and a poor visual outcome. We treated a series of 14 patients (26 eyes) whose visual acuity could not be improved with optical correction (phakic or aphakic) with modern microsurgery and automated suction-cutting devices. Preoperative visual acuity ranged from 0.05 to 0.3. Improvement in post-operative visual acuity was documented in all operated eyes, ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 during a follow-up period ranging from 6 to 59 months (medium 43 months). The only complication was a small accidental cut in the pupillary border in three eyes. Other complication did not occur.
