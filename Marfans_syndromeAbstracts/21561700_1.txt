 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Marfan syndrome is an inherited disease of the connective tissue. Recent trials have indicated the use of losartan (a transforming growth factor beta inhibitor) in these patients prevents aortic root enlargement. The aim of our clinical trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of losartan versus atenolol in the prevention of progressive dilation of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome. METHODS: This is a phase III clinical trial conducted in two institutions. A total of 150 subjects diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, aged between 5 and 60 years, of both sexes, and who meet the Ghent diagnostic criteria will be included in the study, with 75 patients per treatment group. It will be a randomized, double blind trial with parallel assignment to atenolol versus losartan (50 mg per day in patients below 50 kg and 100 mg per day in patients over 50 kg). Both growth and distensibility of the aorta will be assessed with echocardiography and magnetic resonance. Follow-up will be 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of losartan versus atenolol in the prevention of progressive dilation of the aorta, improved aortic distensibility, and prevention of adverse events (aortic dissection or rupture, cardiovascular surgery, or death) will be assessed in this study. It will also show the possible treatment benefits at different age ranges and with relation to the initial level of aortic root dilation.
