Spontaneous aortic dissection is a rare, life-threatening cause of chest pain, and has a higher prevalence when traditional risks such as age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or connective tissue disorders are present. However, even in the absence of risk factors, non-traumatic rupture of an aortic dissection may occur. Most are found in patients over 40 years of age. Younger victims of this disease often also suffer from other conditions such as cystic medial necrosis, connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome, or vasculitis. We present the case of an 18-year-old, previously healthy woman who was country line dancing when she began to complain of severe, cramping chest and back pain. She was hemodynamically stable on initial presentation but experienced two seizures while in the emergency department and was intubated. Subsequently, her blood pressure dropped and she developed cardiac arrest, and despite vigorous resuscitation that included blood products and emergency department thoracotomy, she was refractory to all attempts. At autopsy she was found to have a spontaneous, non-traumatic rupture of an aortic dissection. This patient had no discernable risk factors for aortic dissection or discoverable cause on necropsy. We present this case to raise awareness among physicians and review other reported cases in the literature of aortic dissection in patients under age 40 years.
