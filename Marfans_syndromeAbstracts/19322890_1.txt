 BACKGROUND: Rarely occurring in the pediatric and adolescent population, aortic dissection is a condition with many predisposing factors. Previous studies have suggested that congenital cardiovascular disorders are the most common predisposing conditions. Trauma-associated aortic dissection is considered a rare occurrence. METHODS: The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database of New York State was used to retrieve cases of aortic dissection in persons < or = 21 years old over a 10-year period. A retrospective analysis for risk or associated conditions was undertaken. RESULTS: Forty-five of a total of 12,142 cases of aortic dissection (0.37%) occurred in persons < or = 21 years old. No patient was younger than 15 years of age. Six of the 45 died (13%). Most patients were male (37 of 45, or 82%). Contrary to previous reports, the most common associated condition was trauma (19 of 45, or 42%), with Marfan syndrome the second most common (11 of 45, or 24%). Ten of 45 adolescent and young adult patients (22%) had no apparent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic aortic disruptions must be considered in children and adolescents who survive serious chest trauma. Family members of pediatric and young adult patients with trauma-associated aortic dissection may need to be evaluated for possible risk of aortic dissection.
