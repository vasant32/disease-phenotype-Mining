Triple-barreled aortic dissection is a rare form of aortic dissection associated with high mortality. We report herein the case of a 41-year-old woman with Marfan's syndrome who developed acute triple-barreled aortic dissection from a Stanford type B dissecting aneurysm. Successful graft replacement of the proximal third of the descending thoracic aorta was subsequently performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of successful operative treatment for an acute triple-barreled aortic dissection ever to be reported.
