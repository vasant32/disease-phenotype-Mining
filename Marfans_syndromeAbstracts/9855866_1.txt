Marfan's syndrome is a genetic disorder that often affects the cardiovascular, pulmonary, ocular, and musculoskeletal systems. When a woman with Marfan's syndrome becomes pregnant, the hormonal stresses and changes to the cardiovascular system can put the mother at risk for serious complications. Advanced practice nurses need to understand the maternal changes associated with Marfan's syndrome as well as the genetic factors involved in order to provide holistic care.
