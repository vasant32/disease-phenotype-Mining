The purpose of this article is to report an unusual bilateral inferior subluxation of the lens in a patient with Marfan's syndrome. A 14-year-old boy presented with gradual painless diminution of vision in both eyes. His family history showed that his maternal uncle also had similar complaints. Systemic examination of the patient revealed no neurological deficits. Cardiovascular system examination was unremarkable. Hands and fingers were long and slender with hyperflexible joints. The ratio of arm spam to height was 1.06. He was myopic with a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/24 with -11 D spherical/-Â 2 D cylindrical in both eyes. Anterior chambers were deep with the presence of mild iridodonesis in both eyes. Pupillary reactions were sluggish. On pupillary dilatation, the lens was found to be subluxated inferiorly which is unlike the typical superotemporal subluxation of the lens in Marfan's syndrome. The diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome is usually made on clinical examination only, as there is no specific investigation for this condition; however, it may have atypical presentations. Therefore, it is important to recognize and report such atypical cases.
