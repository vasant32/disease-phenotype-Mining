Five patients with far advanced cystic medial necrosis of the ascending aorta associated with aortic regurgitation were operated upon using a method not previously described. This new method consists of a special wrapping procedure which acts like a tubular prosthesis replacement and a new technique of fixation of aortic valve prosthesis in order to prevent periprosthetic leakage. The advantages of this new alternative method comparing to the procedure of Bentall and DeBono are discussed.
