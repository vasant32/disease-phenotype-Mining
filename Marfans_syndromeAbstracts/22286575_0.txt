In the current article, 3 cases of aortic aneurysm and dissection in pregnant patients with Marfan's syndrome are reported. It is well known that pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of aortic aneurysm and dissection in women with Marfan's syndrome since it is shown that dissection can develop both before and after labor. Marfan patients with an aortic root diameter greater than 4 cm should undergo preconceptual counseling for surgical aortic repair before pregnancy. Pregnant Marfan patients with an aortic aneurysm should be closely and continuously evaluated by multidisciplinary specialists in order to prevent possible aortic dissection that could be fatal for both the mother and the fetus.
