 AIMS: The right ventricle (RV) ejects the same volume of blood at the same rate as the left ventricle (LV). Mild LV dysfunction has been demonstrated in Marfan syndrome (MFS). However, little attention has been paid to the functioning of the RV. The aim of this study was to assess RV function in unoperated adult MFS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 66 unoperated (15-58 years) MFS patients and 61 controls, rate of pressure rise (dp/dt) in RV, and tricuspid annular motion (TAM) were studied using conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). When compared with controls, MFS patients showed impaired RV systolic function as expressed by a reduced dp/dt, TAM obtained by M-mode echocardiography, and peak TDI systolic velocities at the basal lateral wall (745.36+/-37.85 vs. 1103.30+/-27.30 mmHg, P<0.001; 2.2+/-0.05 vs. 2.5+/-0.05 cm, P<0.001; and 0.13+/-0.002 vs. 0.16+/-0.002 m/s, P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a primary impairment of RV systolic function in MFS. This is the first study to report RV dysfunction in MFS. Such data could prove valuable during the peri-operative and long-term medical management of MFS patients.
