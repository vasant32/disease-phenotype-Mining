Patients with Marfan syndrome (n=44) and ascending aorta aneurism combined with aortic insufficiency were followed up for 1 month - 16 years after graft repair of the ascending aorta aneurysm and replacement of aortic valve. Patients were divided into two groups: with dissecting aneurism (n=25) and chronic nondissecting aneurism (n=19). In remote postoperative period 11 patients had 13 complications (2 patients had 2 complications each - graft dysfunction and arterial thromboembolism). Repetitive surgery was carried out in 5 patients after 67.2 +/- 19.4 months because of expansion of dissection to the abdominal aorta, dysfunction of mitral valve prosthesis. In remote period of follow up 15 patients (34.1%) died. Causes of death were graft dysfunction, extension of aortic dissection, myocardial failure. Total survival was 80, 54 and 46% for 1 month, 10 and 15 years, respectively.
