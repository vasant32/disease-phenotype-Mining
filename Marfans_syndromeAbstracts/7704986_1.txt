Little morphologic information is available on operatively excised pulmonic valves. The causes of pulmonic stenosis are limited to a few conditions: (1) rheumatic and (2) nonrheumatic (congenital, carcinoid, infective endocarditis). Congenital causes of pulmonic stenosis constitute well over 95% of these conditions. Congenital types of pulmonic stenosis include acommissural dome-shaped, dysplastic, and bicuspid. Rare acquired causes of pulmonic stenosis include carcinoid, rheumatic, and infective endocarditis. Of the acquired causes of pulmonic stenosis, carcinoid is the most common condition. In contrast, causes of pure pulmonic regurgitation are multiple. Two major categories of pure pulmonic regurgitation include (1) conditions associated with anatomically abnormal valve cusps (congenital, rheumatic, carcinoid, trauma, and infective endocarditis) and (2) conditions associated with anatomically normal cusps (elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures, idiopathic dilated pulmonary trunk, and Marfan's syndrome).
