Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), haematologic disease affecting the only blood platelets, is an acquired disease. It appears as cutaneous and mucosal bleedings preceded by a feverish syndrome. Cerebral haemorrhage is possible but very rare. If the disease occurs frequently in Europe and in the United States of America, there is a lack of data in Africa and in Madagascar. In order to fill this gap, the authors carried out retrospective and prospective studies in two paediatric units of Antananarivo for 32 months. They reported 4 cases of PTI of which clinical signs were moderate. As therapy, corticosteroids were used and were efficiency. It is desirable to settle a program allowing to survey sick children.
