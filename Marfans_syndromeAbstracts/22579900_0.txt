We report the case of a 26-year-old female patient with Marfan syndrome and an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) with associated Kommerell diverticulum. The patient presented with spontaneous acute dissection of the ARSA that showed fusiform dilation to 4 cm in diameter. Definitive treatment was performed using a two-stage hybrid endovascular technique, including extrathoracic bilateral upper extremity bypass and thoracic endovascular aortic repair with debranching of the right and left subclavian arteries. This was followed by coil and plug embolization to exclude the dissection and prevent subsequent endoleak.
