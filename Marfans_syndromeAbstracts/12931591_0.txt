A 52-year-old woman, height, 149 cm; weight, 40 kg, was admitted because of anterior chest discomfort and palpitations. There was no family history of Marfan syndrome. She had undergone replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve 10 years prior for DeBakey II aortic dissection. Postoperative pathological examination of the resected aortic wall revealed cystic medionecrosis. Computed tomography(CT) 4 years after the surgery showed moderate enlargement of the preserved sinuses of Valsalva, and CT 10 years after the surgery showed enlargement of the sinus. She consented to a reoperation. The prostheses were explanted, and the aortic root was replaced with a composite graft. The right coronary artery ostium was completely closed, and no graftable portions of the distal right coronary artery were detected. Thus, the left coronary artery alone was reimplanted. The patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 10 days postoperatively, after which she recovered fully without complications. This case may indicate that the complete aortic root should be replaced during initial surgery of the ascending aorta or aortic valve in patients with potential risk of sinus of Valsalva dilatation.
