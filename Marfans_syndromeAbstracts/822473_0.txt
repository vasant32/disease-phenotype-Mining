Numerous control systems are involved in the growth and differentiation of chondro-osseous tissue. Theoretically, the failure of each single step will result in a peculiar skeletal dysplasia. The resulting disorders are caused by errors in the metabolism of collagen, minerals, complex carbohydrates and the protein of the ground substance. Skeletal dysplasias with a known or probable metabolic base include osteogenesis imperfecta, osteoectasia with macrocranium, Menkes syndrome, the mucopolysaccharidoses and hypophosphatasia.
