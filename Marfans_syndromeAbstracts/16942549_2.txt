OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of migraine in Marfan's syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from Landsforeningen (a patient organization) for Marfan's syndrome. A total of 46 persons were eligible for a validated semi-structured telephone interview by a physician trained in headache diagnostics. RESULTS: The prevalence of migraine without aura was 13% among men and 40% among women. The prevalence of migraine with aura was 44% among men and 37% among women. The overall prevalence of migraine was 63% with an equal sex ratio. This corresponds to a 3.6- and 2.0-fold significant increased risk among men and women, respectively, compared with the general population. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence and equal sex ratio of migraine is puzzling and likely to be secondary to Marfan's syndrome. It might be associated with dural ectasia, as the prevalence of dural ectasia is similar to that of migraine in Marfan's syndrome.
