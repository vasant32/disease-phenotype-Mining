State-of-the-art multidetector computed tomographic (CT) technology has replaced invasive angiography for evaluation of patients suspected to have aortic disease. Although most aortic disease is associated with atherosclerosis (ie, aneurysms and dissection), the spectrum of aortic disease is vast and includes various congenital and acquired entities. Radiologists should also be familiar with uncommon aortic diseases, which are divided into those that are congenital in origin and acquired disorders, and with their findings at multidetector CT. The first group includes patent ductus arteriosus, aortic hypoplasia, aortic coarctation, interrupted aortic arch, aortopulmonary window, common arterial trunk, supravalvular aortic stenosis, and vascular rings. The acquired disorders include aortic dissection due to extension of a coronary artery dissection, Marfan syndrome, large-vessel vasculitis such as Takayasu arteritis, and mycotic aneurysms. Finally, specific conditions associated with therapeutic maneuvers--such as recoarctation, stent-graft rupture, and endoleaks--can also be assessed with multidetector CT. Multidetector CT is an alternative tool helpful in establishing the primary diagnosis, defining anatomic landmarks and their relationships, and identifying associated cardiovascular anomalies. It is also an adjunct in the evaluation of complications during follow-up.
