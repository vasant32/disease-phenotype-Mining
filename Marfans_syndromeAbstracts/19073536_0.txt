We report the case of a 23-year-old man with an unruptured noncoronary sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and Marfan syndrome, which were diagnosed by 16-row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). MDCT has enabled imaging of the cross-sectional anatomy of the heart with excellent spatial and temporal resolution that reflects the anatomical and functional changes in cardiac pathologies. Thus, the knowledge of the CT anatomy of the heart has become increasingly important for radiologists. This report aimed to confirm the contribution of MDCT in establishing the diagnosis and to show the potential association of nodular septation in the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva with aneurysm.
