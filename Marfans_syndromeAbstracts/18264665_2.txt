A heritable connective-tissue-disorder often is suspected in patients with spontaneous spinal CSF leaks and intracranial hypotension, but the nature of the disorder remains unknown in most patients. The aim of this study was to assess the gene encoding TGF-beta receptor-2 (TGFBR2) as a candidate gene for spinal CSF leaks. We searched the TGFBR2 gene for mutations in eight patients with spontaneous spinal CSF leaks who also had other features associated with TGFBR2 mutations, i.e., skeletal features of Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and(or) thoracic aortic aneurysm. The mean age of these 7 women and 1 man was 38 years (range 14-60 years). We detected no TGFBR2 mutations and conclude that TGFBR2 mutations are not a major factor in spontaneous spinal CSF leaks.
