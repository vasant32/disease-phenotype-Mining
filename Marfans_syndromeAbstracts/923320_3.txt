Echocardiography has proven a useful and sensitive means to determine noninvasively the cardiac dimensions. This report describes the echocardiographic detection of progressive dilatation of the aortic root over an 18-month period, which led to death in a 33-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome; however, at no time was the aortic dilatation evident on chest x-ray films. This patient illustrates the sensitivity of the echocardiogram in detecting and assessing the severity of disease of the aortic root not readily assessed by other noninvasive techniques and the value of serial measurements of aortic dimensions in patients with proven or suspected dilatation of the aortic root.
