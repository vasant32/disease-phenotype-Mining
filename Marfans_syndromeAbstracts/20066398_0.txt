 INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to compare the incidence of urinary incontinence in women with Marfan syndrome and controls, hypothesizing that connective tissue abnormality could contribute to urinary incontinence. METHODS: A cross-sectional historical cohort study was conducted on 14 premenopausal women with Marfan syndrome and 534 controls using Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form. RESULTS: Marfan subjects had significantly higher incidence of urinary symptoms, stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) than controls (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, P = 0.02), despite their lower parity (P = 0.01). Direct logistic regression analysis indicated that Marfan syndrome, parity and age were associated with SUI; while Marfan syndrome was the only significant predictor of UUI. CONCLUSIONS: Premenopausal women with Marfan syndrome had a higher incidence of reported urinary symptoms. Urinary incontinence should be added to the list of clinical manifestations in women with Marfan syndrome.
