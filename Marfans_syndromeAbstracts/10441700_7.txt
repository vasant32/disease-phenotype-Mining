The neonatal Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an extremely poor prognosis. This report gives a clinical and echocardiographic description of an infant with a mutation in exon 29 of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1), a region in which this severe form of Marfan syndrome seems to cluster. The infant died at the age of 3 months due to severe acute mitral regurgitation leading to intractable heart failure.
