The authors discuss current state of knowledge contained in medical literature, concerning procedures with pregnant women with Marfan syndrome and give proposes directives of procedure in this causes. The most important parameters that distinguish with regard of risk of falling into layers of aorta or increase insufficiency aortic valvae during pregnancy is dimension of aortic bulb. If its is more than 4 cm the pregnancy should be avoided limitation of activity is recommended in treatment pregnant women with Marfan's syndrome. The blood pressure should be kept below 130 mm Hg eventually using beta-receptors blockers is recommended. It aortic bulb is wided to 5.5 cm the possibility of cardiosurgical intervention should be taken into consideration. Systematically evaluation of CTG after 6-8 weeks during pregnancy and to two months after delivery for evaluation the dimension of aorta and function of vulvae. We prefer the spontaneous delivery when the aortic dimension is less than 4 cm with collaboration with anaesthesiologist. It is reasonable to perform cesarean section if the dimension of aortic bulb is more than 4 cm.
