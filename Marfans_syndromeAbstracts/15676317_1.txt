The UK registry of high-risk obstetric anaesthesia was set up in late 1996 to collect reports of high-risk pregnancy, pool them into a central database and disseminate the results. At the time of analysis for this paper (December 31, 2001) 308 cardiorespiratory reports had been received. The five most common conditions, occurring in 125 cases (41% of the total), were arrhythmias (43 cases), cardiomyopathy (26 cases), aortic stenosis (24 cases), transposition of the great arteries (18 cases) and Marfan's syndrome (14 cases). We describe the features and management of these cases.
