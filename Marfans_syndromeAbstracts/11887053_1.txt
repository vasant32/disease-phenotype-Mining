Six cases of spontaneous coronary arteries dissection are reported. In one patient, triple vessel spontaneous coronary artery dissection was identified. Another patient presented spontaneous left main coronary artery dissection. In one case we found the spontaneous dissection of the left anterior descending artery associated with distal aortic arch dissection. These conditions are very rare and may present a surgical dilemma. Causative factors and underlying pathology are clarified. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention is safe and effective. Early recognition of left main coronary artery dissection or three-vessel dissection is essential because urgent coronary artery bypass grafting may be life saving.
