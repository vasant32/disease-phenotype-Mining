Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Marfan syndrome. The most life threatening complication is aortic root aneurysms leading to aortic dissection or rupture. It can be prevented by regular aortic follow-up and prophylactic aortic surgery. Modern aortic surgery has led to a substantial increase in the life expectancy of these patients. We report two cases of Marfan syndrome with cardiovascular complications. Their management is discussed according to the most recent literature.
