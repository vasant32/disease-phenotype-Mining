The surgical outcomes in 11 patients with a Marfan syndrome (mean [+/- SD] age, 32 +/- 16: range 0.5 to 60) were evaluated. Echocardiography demonstrated annuloaortic ectasia (AAE) in nine patients, mitral regurgitation (5 months baby: valve replaced) and abdominal aortic aneurysm in one each. Among 9 AAE, root were replaced in 8 patients and aortic valve was preserved only one patient. Our early-time result is encouraging in our valve-sparing operation.
