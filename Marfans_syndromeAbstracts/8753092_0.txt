One-stage operation was successfully performed in 30-year-old male with annulo aortic ectasia and mitral valve regurgitation secondary to Marfan's syndrome. The replacement of the mitral valve was performed through aortic root. The transaortic mitral valve replacement employed here should prove useful for similar cases requiring reconstruction of aortic root and replacement of mitral valve simultaneously in Malfan's syndrome.
