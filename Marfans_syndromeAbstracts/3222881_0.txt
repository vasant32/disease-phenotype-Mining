An experience with 26 operations for aneurysms of the ascending aorta with a concomitant insufficiency of the aorta valve in Marfan syndrome is described. We started using operations after Bentall-De Bono in 1979 and operations after Cabrol in 1983 which were used in cases with low localization of openings of the coronary arteries in relation to the fibrous ring of the aorta valve, as well as in cases with the dissecting aorta wall, especially involving the area of the openings. These operations allowed the intrahospital lethality to be reduced: in the period of 1979-86 it made up 30% (6 patients died out of 20), in 1983-86 it was 15.4%, in 1986 it was 12.5%.
