Pregnant women with a Marfan syndrome carry a risk of developing an aortic arc dissection. As the developing aneurism may be diagnosed by echocardiography, this method should be applied repeatedly during pregnancy. We report the case of a Marfan patient, who developed an acute aortic dissection during the third trimester of her pregnancy and discuss the guidance and surveillance of Marfan patients who are or wish to become pregnant.
