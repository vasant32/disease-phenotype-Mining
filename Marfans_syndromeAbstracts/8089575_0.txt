A 20-year-old man of Marfan's syndrome who had mitral valve regurgitation, annuloaortic ectasia with aortic valve regurgitation and aortic arch aneurysm was successfully treated with radical operation. Mitral valve replacement was performed with superior wall incision of the left atrium directly. Complete transection of the aortic root made it easy to reach the mitral valve. The diameter of his ascending aorta was 70 mm, and modified Bentall' procedure, Carrel patch method, was performed. Aortic arch was 40 mm in diameter, and total aortic arch replacement was performed under hypothermic circulatory arrest. After the combined operation, patient was recovered uneventfully.
