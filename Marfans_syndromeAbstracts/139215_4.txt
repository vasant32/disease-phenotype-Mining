Nine patients with the Marfan syndrome and 40 of their first degree relatives were evaluated for the presence of cardiac, skeletal and ophthalmologic abnormalities. Aortic root dilatation and mitral valve prolapse were sought by echocardiography, and the metacarpal index was calculated from hand X-rays. Abnormalities of all the tests performed were present in all nine index cases, except for one normal eye exam. Mitral prolapse was present in thirteen relatives (33%) and aortic root dilatation in seven (18%). At least one cardiac abnormality was present in nineteen (47%) relatives. Aortic root dilatation was more common in male relatives; the incidence of mitral prolapse was approximately equal in the two sexes. Abnormal metacarpal index (greater than 8.0) occurred in fifteen of twenty-six relatives examined (58%). Ophthalmologic abnormalities were found in only four relatives. Two relatives had abnormalities of all three organ systems evaluated, five others had abnormalities of two systems, and fourteen had abnormalities of one system. We conclude that cardiac and skeletal abnormalities are demonstrable in a high percentage of first degree relatives of patients with the Marfan syndrome.
