A 22-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome and a history of antinuclear antibody-positive hepatitis died 25 days after undergoing cardiac valve replacement surgery for mitral valve prolapse. Giant cell myocarditis was found at autopsy. The multinucleated giant cells were shown by immunoperoxidase techniques to contain lysozyme, but not myosin or creatine phosphokinase, suggesting that they were derived from macrophage, rather than myocyte, precursors.
