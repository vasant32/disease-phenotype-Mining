A 29-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome presented with sudden onset of central chest pain radiating to the back. Aortography revealed a massively dilated right sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, with moderate aortic regurgitation. Urgent surgery in the form of a Bentall procedure was successfully carried out. There was no evidence of either aortic rupture or dissection. Acute expansion of the aneurysm must have precipitated the symptoms. The patient was alive and well three months later.
