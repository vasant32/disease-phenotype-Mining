This study reviewed the utility of echocardiography in following patients with the Marfan syndrome for whom cardiovascular complications, especially aortic root dilatation, dissection and rupture, are the major causes of morbidity and mortality. We conclude that echocardiography can be used to follow asymptomatic patients with the Marfan syndrome.
