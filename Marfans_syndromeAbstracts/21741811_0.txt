A 37 year old woman with Marfan's syndrome underwent an elective gynecologic procedure. Mask ventilation was not difficult but initial direct laryngoscopy showed no view of the glottic opening. The patient's trachea was quickly and successfully intubated using a supraglottic jet ventilation technique. The technique provided oxygenation and ventilation during intubation and assisted intubation of a patient with a grade III glottic view. No hypoxia or barotrauma were noted during the intubation.
