14 patients (16 eyes) of Marfan's syndrome are reviewed with regard to retinal detachment. The patients aged a mean 25.1 years; 9 cases were of high myopia, and lens dislocation was found in all. Multiple atrophic retinal holes were detected in 11 eyes (68.8%), and the retina was totally detached in 12 eyes (75.0%). Scleral encircling with external compression performed in 15 eyes achieved retinal reattachment in 14 eyes. The predisposing factors for retinal detachment, the selection of the mode of surgery, the management of the pupil, and the prognosis are discussed.
