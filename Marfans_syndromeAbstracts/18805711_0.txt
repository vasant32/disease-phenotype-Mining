 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of pulp calcifications in patients with Marfan syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: The prevalence of pulp stones and pulp obliteration was evaluated on bitewing radiographs in 21 subjects with Marfan syndrome and in 100 healthy controls. RESULTS: Subjects with Marfan syndrome older than 30 years of age showed a significantly higher prevalence of pulp stones (P = .027) or pulp obliteration (P < .001). Pulp stones were present in 20.7% and pulp obliteration was found in 7.9% of the examined teeth in this group. Subjects with Marfan syndrome also revealed a significant correlation between age and number of teeth with pulp stones or pulp obliteration. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that pulp calcifications are frequent findings in subjects with Marfan syndrome. This should be taken into consideration in endodontic or orthodontic treatment.
