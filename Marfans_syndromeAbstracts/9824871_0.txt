The authors describe a simplified and safer technique for surgical removal of hereditary or idiopathic soft subluxated lenses. Five eyes of three patients underwent intercapsular aspiration of the lens material. A side-port cannula was introduced through the pars plicata while the eyes were pressurized by an anterior chamber maintainer. This was followed by anterior vitrectomy and capsulectomy. With this technique, the risk of vitreous loss, which can occur with an anterior approach, and the risk of the spread of lens particles into the vitreous, which can occur with a lensectomy with a vitrectomy probe, are avoided. Postoperatively, optical correction was achieved with a contact lens in the two children and with an anterior chamber intraocular lens in the adult. Final visual acuity was 6/9 or better in all eyes. No surgical or other complication occurred during 2 to 4 years of follow-up. A soft subluxated lens can be removed without the risks of vitreous loss or spread of lens particles into the vitreous, reducing the probability of severe complications.
