A 33 year old woman with Marfan's syndrome and aortic root dissection was studied with precordial and suprasternal echocardiography. The precordial approach revealed some typical features of aortic root dissection. With suprasternal echocardiography it was possible to visualize the characteristic diagnostic feature of this disease: within the aortic lumen an m-shaped pattern--the aortic intimal flap--moving downward to the posterior aortic wall during systole. The diagnosis was confirmed with aortic cineangiography and intraoperative findings. Thus, suprasternal echocardiography can be a useful method of detecting aortic root dissection, especially in patients with aortic arch dissection alone.
