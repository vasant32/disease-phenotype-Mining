A sporadic case of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B in a twenty-six year old man who manifested medullary thyroid carcinoma, multiple mucosal neuromas of the tongue and a marfanoid habitus is reported. At the time of diagnosis, he also had multiple liver and lung metastases. Genetic analysis of his lymphocytes revealed a point mutation in exon 16 of the RET proto-oncogene. Since multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B has a relatively poor prognosis because of the occasional aggressive behavior of medullary thyroid carcinoma, the necessity of the genetic diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia in the early stage is suggested.
