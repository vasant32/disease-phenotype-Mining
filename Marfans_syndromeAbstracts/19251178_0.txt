Valve-sparing aortic root repair (V-SARR) using the David reimplantation method is an increasingly popular alternative to composite valve graft aortic root replacement in patients with aortic root aneurysms or dissections who wish to avoid anticoagulation. Computed tomography (CT) with retrospective electrocardiograph (ECG)-gating has become routine before and following V-SARR at Stanford. CT allows accurate measurement of aortic dimensions and provides unprecedented three-dimensional (3D) images of the sinuses, the aortic valve cusps, and coronary arteries in patients with the Marfan syndrome (MFS), with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), or other aortic diseases. This helps the surgeon to conceptualize the size of the aortic grafts required and how much reduction is necessary proximally (aortic annulus) and distally. These maneuvers are used to reduce the aortic annular diameter (when necessary) and replace the sinuses and ascending aorta (T. David-V, Stanford modification V-SARR). Postoperative ECG-gated CT confirms the reconstructed geometry and reliably detects coronary or other anastomotic problems.
