 BACKGROUND: Herein are described recent developments in aortic surgery techniques and the improved results. METHODS: Of 403 ascending and aortic arch operations, 68 patients underwent minimally invasive aortic surgery including 23 for aortic dissection, 5 for Marfan syndrome, 29 reoperations, and 39 with hypothermic arrest. Blood conservation methods were used in 187 of the 403 patients (46.5%). Aortic valve procedures were used in 267 (66.2%), including 51 (12.7%) valve-preserving operations. A protocol for stroke and neurocognitive deficit prevention was used in an attempt to prevent neurologic deficits. Data were prospectively collected and included new neurocognitive events either by formal testing (n = 35) or by informal questioning. RESULTS: Stroke occurred in 2.0% (8 of 403); clinical gross neurocognitive deficits in 2.5% (10 of 403) with a 98% 30-day survival. For those patients undergoing the minimally invasive operation 1 hospital death occurred (98.5% survival). Homologous operative transfusions were required in only 12% of blood conservation patients (23 of 187) and their postoperative intubation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay were significantly shorter (p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive surgery is particularly useful for reoperations. The blood conservation methods appear to be beneficial and the number of neurologic deficits is low with the current protocol.
