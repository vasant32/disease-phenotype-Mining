BACKGROUND: Aim of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing immediate and long-term results in patients undergoing aortic root replacement with a composite graft. METHODS: Between January 1989 and February 1999, 105 patients (83 males, 22 females) who underwent Bentall technique were studied. Preoperative diagnosis was annulo-aortic ectasia in 54, aortic dissection in 27, atherosclerotic aneurysm in 21, and aortitis in 3 cases. Seventeen patients were affected by Marfan's syndrome. All cases, elective, urgent, and emergency were included. Button technique was performed and the associated surgical procedures were coronary artery bypass grafting in 21, total aortic arch replacement in 15, proximal hemi arch in 5, and mitral valve replacement in 5 cases. RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality rate was 7.6% (n=8). Univariate analysis using chi(2) and/or two-sample "t"-test showed that dissection, aortitis, aneurysm rupture into-pleura or pericardium, emergency status, redo, prolonged pump times and circulatory arrest, were predictors influencing in-hospital mortality. Coagulopathy, low cardiac output, stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, surgical bleeding leading to reoperation, were significantly related to in-hospital mortality (by correlation analysis). A multivariate analysis showed that, emergency status (p=0.027), aortic dissection (p=0.029), perioperative myocardial infarction (p=0.0021), reoperation for bleeding (p=0.0023), and pump time >180 min (p=0.011), were significant. The actuarial survival rate at 10 years follow-up was 84.7%. There were 8 late deaths. The Kaplan-Meier showed significant differences when considering dissection vs non-dissection (p=0.018), but did not reach significance in Marfan vs non-Marfan groups (p=0.83). NYHA class IV (p=0.052), previous cardiac surgery procedure (p=0.041), concomitant CABG (p=0.021), total aortic arch reconstruction (p=0.001), and mitral valve replacement (p=0.016), were identified as significant by Log Rank test. CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure for aortic root replacement is safe and durable; in hospital mortality in elective status it was 1.28%; early and long-term mortality higher in patients with acute dissection. Six late deaths were procedures related. Sixty-six patients (76.4%) were in NYHA I class at follow-up. The incidence of late outcomes, thromboembolism (1.03%), graft infection (2.06%), pseudoaneurysm (0%), reoperation in ascending aorta or aortic valve (3.1%), operations on the remaining aorta (6.7%), and hemorrhage due to anticoagulant therapy (1.03%), are very low.
