We report two families in which the probands have compound-heterozygous Marfan syndrome (MFS). The proband of family 1 has the R2726W FBN1 mutation associated with isolated skeletal features on one allele and a pathogenic FBN1 mutation on the other allele. The phenotype of the compound-heterozygous probands appears to be more severe than that of their heterozygous family members which underlines the possibility that certain trans-located FBN1 mutations might act as modifiers of phenotype explaining some of the intrafamilial variability in Marfan syndrome.
