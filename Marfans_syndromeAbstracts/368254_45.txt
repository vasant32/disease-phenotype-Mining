The elastic fibers present in various connective tissues of the body are responsible for physiologic elasticity of the organs. These fibers consist of 2 distinct components, elastin and the elastic fiber microfibrils. Controlled synthesis and balanced interaction of these 2 components are essential for normal fibrillogenesis. The intracellular biosynthesis of elastin by connective tissue cells, such as smooth muscle cells, involves assembly of the polypeptide chains on the membrane-bound ribosomes, hydroxylation of some prolyl residues to hydroxyproline, and secretion of the polypeptides packaged in Golgi vacuoles. In the extracellular space the elastin molecules assemble into fiber structures which are stabilized by the synthesis of complex covalent cross-links, desmosines. Recently, aberrations in the structure or metabolism of elastin have been detected in a variety of heritable and acquired diseases affecting skin and other connective tissues. These conditions include pseudoxanthoma elasticum, cutis laxa, and elastosis perforans serpiginosa, as well as arteriosclerosis and other degenerative changes of the vascular connective tissues.
