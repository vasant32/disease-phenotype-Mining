Five index patients and three of their first-degree relatives were affected both by schizophrenia and Marfan syndrome. Since the association appears statistically significant, the possibility of linkage disequilibrium between adjacent genes or a cytogenetic abnormality causing both disorders is suggested. These hypotheses are testable and hold promise in attempting to map the 'schizophrenia susceptibility gene' by the candidate-gene approach.
