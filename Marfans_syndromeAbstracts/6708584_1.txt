This report describes our experience with a 4-month-old infant with annuloaortic ectasia in whom intractable heart failure developed because of acute exacerbation of aortic regurgitation. He underwent an aortoplasty with aortic valve replacement and made an uneventful recovery. Since there has been no report of a successful repair of this condition in infancy, the case is presented and relevant problems are discussed.
