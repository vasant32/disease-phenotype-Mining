We successfully repaired a rupture of a normal-sized, non-dissected distal aortic arch in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Six years previously she had undergone repair of the thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm with a 24-mm knitted Dacron graft for type B chronic aortic dissection. The rupture site was located at the back of the native distal aortic arch just 10 mm above the proximal anastomosis, and just below the left subclavian artery. This unexpected situation might be related to dilatation of the knitted Dacron graft up to 34 mm (142%), thus stretching out the fragile native aorta in this Marfan patient.
