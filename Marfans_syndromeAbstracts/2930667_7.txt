Twenty three patients with fragile X syndrome underwent cardiovascular assessment. Echocardiography showed dilatation of the aortic root in 12 (52%) and mitral valve prolapse in five (22%), four of whom had an apical mid-systolic click on auscultation. Patients with fragile X syndrome have cardiac defects similar to those seen in other disorders of connective tissue such as Marfan's syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These, and other somatic features, suggest an underlying connective tissue dysplasia.
