Six cases of Arnold-Chiari malformation Type I were studied according to the following instrumental protocol; skull and atlanto-occipital hinge X-rays, including the tomography of these regions, X-rays of the spine, vertebral angiography, isotopic cisternography using RIHSA injected intraspinally, fractionated pneumoencephalography, Dimer-X ventriculography and iodized myelography. The AA emphasize the importance of the cisternographic test with radioisotopes for pre-operative and post-operative control of the C.S.F. dynamic.
