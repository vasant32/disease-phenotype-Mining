The authors describe a previously undocumented complication of suboccipital craniectomy combined with duraplasty for the treatment of Chiari malformation Type I and propose techniques to prevent its occurrence. Although there have been reports of epidural pseudomeningoceles in the setting of spontaneous intracranial hypotension and intracranial hygromas following suboccipital craniectomy with duraplasty, the authors believe this case to be the first instance of quadriparesis caused by the delayed formation of a compressive epidural cerebrospinal fluid collection after suboccipital craniectomy with duraplasty. This complication is significant and must be recognized given the potential severity of neurological insult and the number of these procedures performed yearly in both the pediatric and adult populations.
