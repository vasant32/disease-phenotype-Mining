PURPOSE: Rates of neural axis abnormalities in infantile and juvenile idiopathic scoliosis may be as high as 50 %. We aimed to determine the rates of neural axis abnormalities in early onset idiopathic scoliosis patients in a British population. METHODS: This retrospective study at two British spinal deformity clinics identified 72 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria of: (1) age at diagnosis of 7 years and younger, (2) idiopathic scoliosis and (3) magnetic resonance imaging of the neuraxis. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 3.6 years and the mean Cobb angle was 47° with a near equal distribution of left (32) and right (36) sided curves. Eight (11.1 %) neural axis abnormalities consisting of two syrinxes, one Arnold-chiari Type I malformation and five combined (Arnold-chiari malformation Type I and syrinx) anomalies were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-centre study on the largest number of British subjects to date helps to establish the rates of neural axis abnormalities.
