A 38-year-old woman complained for about 5 years of attacks of headache elicited by coughing, sneezing, and laughing. These attacks became more frequent and more severe. Physical examination showed a short and broad neck. Neurological examination revealed no abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the Chiari malformation (type I) and the cerebral venous angioma in left frontal white matter. A posterior decompression by suboccipital craniectomy with C1 laminectomy was performed. The headache completely disappeared. Before and after the operation, we measured the intracranial subdural pressure by a small pressure transducer. The raised cranial pressure by the Valsalva's maneuver prolonged for more than one minute. Postoperatively, the raised cranial pressure by the Valsalva's maneuver decreased rapidly. We consider that the cough headache of this patient was associated with a valve-like blockage by the Chiari malformation (type I) at the foramen magunum, resulting in cranio-spinal pressure dissociation by interference with downward pulsation. We believe that there was no correlation between the cough headache and the cerebral venous angioma.
