 OBJECTIVE: To characterize the presenting symptoms among persons with radiographic evidence of Chiari malformation (CM) type I in an effort to help the primary care provider determine accurate diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: The symptoms of CM can often be vague and ambiguous, leading to misdiagnosis. Patients who had radiographic evidence of CM with or without syringomyelia were prospectively studied. The detailed symptom data were collected from patient reports at initial examination to determine if there was a pattern of symptoms typically attributable to the CM. RESULTS: Analysis of presenting symptoms among 265 patients demonstrated a distinct pattern of symptom constellation. This study reports a prospective analysis of presenting symptoms among 265 patients with radiographic evidence of CM with or without syringomyelia and defines a common presentation pattern. Recognition of typical symptoms attributable to CM can result in appropriate diagnostic workup, accurate diagnosis, and timely treatment, leading to improved patient outcomes.
