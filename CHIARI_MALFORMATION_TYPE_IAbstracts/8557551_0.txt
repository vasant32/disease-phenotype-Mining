Adult Arnold-Chiari malformation, also known as Chiari malformation type I, typically occurs in women during early adulthood and can be a cause of unexplained headaches, as well as associated syringomyelocele. In this unique case report, a 32-year-old, postpartum woman with posturally induced headache from Chiari malformation type I had symptoms occur for the first time during pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the diagnosis and is the neuroimaging study of choice in such cases. Neurosurgical decompression, when performed early, is highly successful in symptomatic individuals.
