The spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia in the setting of a Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) has been reported infrequently. Several theories about the pathogenesis and spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia associated with CM-I have been proposed. The authors present the case of a patient with spontaneous resolution of a CM-I and syringomyelia coinciding with the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea. Although cases of spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia have been reported, this is the first reported case of spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia and a CM-I associated with the simultaneous development of CSF otorrhea.
