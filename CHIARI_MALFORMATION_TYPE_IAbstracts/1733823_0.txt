A five-year-old girl was referred for chronic and stable velopharyngeal insufficiency. Pharyngoplasty was performed, without significant improvement, and further neurological investigation was undertaken. Clinical examination and electromyography led to a suspicion of denervation of the IX, X and XI cranial nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a type 1 Chiari malformation.
