The authors describe a method of harvesting autologous pericranium for duraplasty in patients with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) that avoids excessive exposure or a second incision. Nonautologous dural grafts have been associated with numerous complications including hemorrhage, bacteria and virus transmission, fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease transmission, foreign body reaction, systemic immune response, excessive scarring, slower healing, premature graft dissolution, and wound dehiscence. Autogenous tissues have the advantage of being nonimmunogenic, nontoxic, readily available, and inexpensive. Pericranium is a preferred substrate because it is flexible, strong, and easily sutured for a watertight closure. Current literature supports the use of autogenous pericranium for dural grafting in CM-I procedures, but has heretofore failed to provide a method of harvest that avoids the complications associated with a larger exposure or second incision. The authors offer a simple alternative technique for using local pericranium in duraplasty for CM-I or other posterior fossa abnormalities.
