The Authors present a case of type I Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM), with early appearance of clinical symptoms and worsening course of the illness even after surgical treatment. The interest of the case rest both in the rich symptomatology and multiple exams performed which represent the evolution of the neuroradiological techniques of the last thirty years for the study of ACM. Recently, neurophysiologic exams such as somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) helped to further evaluate these patients. Despite such diagnostic evolution, there is no definite etiopathogenesis. Furthermore, as for therapeutics, the best approach is still the Gardner surgical technique, which, at the moment, is debated for frequent post-operative complications and the absence of significant clinical improvement, especially in the most severe cases.
