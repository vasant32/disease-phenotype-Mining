The authors present the case of a child with an untreated lipomyelomeningocele who developed an acquired Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) with a large syrinx over the course of 3 years. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to document a case in which an acquired CM-I evolved in a patient with an untreated tethered cord.
