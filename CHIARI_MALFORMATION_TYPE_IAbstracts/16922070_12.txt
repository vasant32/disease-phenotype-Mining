 OBJECT: The authors sought to establish whether the volume of the posterior fossa in children suffering from Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is smaller than normal, as has been suggested previously. They also investigated the role of syringomyelia in posterior fossa development. METHODS: Both posterior fossa volume (PFV) and intracranial volume (ICV) were measured using segmentation techniques on preoperative magnetic resonance images obtained in 42 children who underwent surgery for CM-I (mean age 127 months, range 36-204 months); 25 (59%) of the patients had syringomyelia. The PFV/ICV ratio was calculated to eliminate differential supratentorial growth. Patients who had deformities potentially interfering with skull growth or who had undergone a shunt insertion procedure prior to craniovertebral decompression were excluded. The results were compared with measurements of 51 healthy children using one-way analysis of variance. In patients with CM-I only, the mean PFV and PFV/ICV ratios were not statistically different than those for healthy children. In patients with both CM-I and syringomyelia (CM-S), the mean PFV and PFV/ICV ratios were statistically smaller than those for healthy children. The ICV was 1383 cm3 in the healthy group, 1459 cm3 in the CM-I only group, and 1400 cm3 in the CM-S group (p = 0.363); the PFV was 186 cm3 in the healthy group, 196 cm3 in the CM-I only group, and 171 cm3 in the CM-S group (p = 0.036); the PFV/ICV ratio was 0.135 in the healthy group, 0.134 in the CM-I only group, and 0.122 in the CM-S group (p = 0.004). These differences were more prominent in the first 10 years of life. CONCLUSIONS: Children with isolated CM-I do not have a PFV smaller than normal, whereas children with both CM-I and syringomyelia have a PFV significantly smaller than normal. This result indicates that the two subgroups may represent different phenotypic expression or even a different pathogenesis.
