Calssical cervical syringomyelia was found in 3 members of one family. All 3 underwent air myelogram, and a Chiari malformation type I and postural collapse of the spinal cord was found in each case. An affected 7-year-old boy was discovered after a clinical and radiological survey of 8 first-degree relatives on the basis of mild scoliosis, pyramidal tract signs in the lower limbs and enlarged sagittal diameter of the cervical canal. One other member had basilar impression of the skull but no neurological abnormalities. No positive correlation was found between either the size of the cystic cord enlargement or descent of the ectopic tonsils with the duration or severity of the neurological findings. Suboccipital decompressive craniotomy and upper cervical laminectomy in one case was followed by improvement in strength and sensation 1 year later. Progression in familial syringomyelia appears to occur through a mechanism identical to that in the sporadic form and surgery is therefore also indicated. In affected families, routine survey of close relatives for abnormal neurological signs, and radiological evidence of scoliotic deformity of the spine, enlarged cervical canal and bone abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction may prove valuable for early detection. A dominantly inherited, genetically determined malformation seems to be the probable mechanism of inheritance in this family.
