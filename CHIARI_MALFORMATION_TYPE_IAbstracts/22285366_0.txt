 OBJECTIVE: An 18-year-old man with Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM) type I developed sudden panic attacks. He also manifested sleep disorder, cannabis abuse, and psychosis-risk syndrome (PRS). Although with average-superior intelligence, he had executive dysfunction. This prompted us to explore the relation between ACM, cannabis abuse, PRS and panic disorder. METHOD: We report the case and briefly review the literature focusing on ACM and psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: Behavior therapy led to gradual abstinence from cannabis with disappearance of anxiety symptoms. The patient is currently well and maintained on omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: Locus coeruleus compression and cannabis abuse may have triggered the symptoms, and the latter might also be PRS-related. PRS and anxiety symptoms should be explored in ACM patients to allow better prevention of psychosis and anxiety disorders.
