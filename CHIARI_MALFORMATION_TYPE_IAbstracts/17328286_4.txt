The authors report the case of a 3-year-old girl with a Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) and concomitant fatty terminal filum. This child was examined prior to the onset of CM-I as well as after, and the authors present magnetic resonance (MR) images documenting that the malformation was acquired as the child grew in height. This case contributes to the literature describing an acquired CM-I associated with a fatty filum and is the first published account to include MR imaging obtained before and after the onset of the malformation.
