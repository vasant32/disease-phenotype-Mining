The paper deals with 5 adults carriers of this syndrome diagnosed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Neither the conventional radiography nor the plain computerized tomography showed indicative clues of the deformity. However electronystagmography prove in all cases a vertical down beating nystagmus. In one instance the nystagmus become rotatory at lateral glance. In all cases appeared an altered smooth pursuit and a lack of suppression fixation of the vestibular nystagmus. The AA. emphasize the diagnostic value of the electronystagmography (which tracings could spare several other, sometimes expensive, examinations) and suggest a prompt MRI.
