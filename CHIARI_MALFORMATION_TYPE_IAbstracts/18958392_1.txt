 INTRODUCTION: Hiccups as the only presenting symptom in neurosurgical practice is uncommon. CASE HISTORY: We report a case of a 22-year-old man who was evaluated for a 9-month history of intractable hiccups. He was diagnosed with a case of Chiari malformation type I. DISCUSSION: Surgical decompression improved the symptoms of the patient. The cause and pathogenesis of hiccups are discussed. CONCLUSION: Chiari malformation should be considered in patients with intractable hiccups, who are otherwise asymptomatic for any neurological problems.
