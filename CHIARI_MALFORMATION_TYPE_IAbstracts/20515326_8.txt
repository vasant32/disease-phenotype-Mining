 OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to evaluate the unique presenting signs and symptoms of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) in children younger than 6 years of age and highlight the benefits of early surgical treatment in this patient population. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of patients who presented to the neurosurgery department before their 6th birthday and subsequently underwent surgery for CM-I. They identified 39 patients who had been evaluated between 1984 and 2007 and examined the medical records for presentation, surgical intervention, and outcome. RESULTS: Children aged 0-2 years commonly presented with oropharyngeal dysfunction (77.8%). Children aged 3-5 years more frequently presented with syringomyelia (85.7%), scoliosis (38.1%), and/or headache (57.1%). All patients underwent posterior fossa craniectomy. Additionally, in many patients cervical laminectomy and/or duraplasty was performed. A few patients required transoral decompression and occipitocervical fusion. In most cases, surgery led to resolution or dramatic improvement of initial symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and surgical treatment of CM-I in young children leads to good outcomes in the majority of patients. Additional therapies for oropharyngeal dysfunction, syringomyelia, and scoliosis can frequently be avoided.
