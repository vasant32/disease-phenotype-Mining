Neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder is reported in only 5% of cases. Here, we report a rare case of neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder, secondary to Chiari malformation Type I with associated syringomyelia, that remained undetected for four years. A 38-year-old female presented to our Department with a swelling over the right shoulder that had persisted for four years. X-ray of the joint showed destruction of the head of the right humerus, with typical blunt amputated appearance of the bone and increased joint space. Magnetic resonance imaging showed destruction and lateral dislocation of the head of the humerus. Large amount of fluid collection was seen in and around the right shoulder joint. Neuropathic osteoarthropathy can be defined as bone and joint changes that occurs secondary to loss of sensation. In our case, neuropathic shoulder joint was secondary to syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformation.
