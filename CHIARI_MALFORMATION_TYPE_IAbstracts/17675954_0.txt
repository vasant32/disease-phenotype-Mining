Background. Syryngomyelia was first described by Olliver in 1824. Burwell and Williams reported a 50% incidence of scoliosis in patients with syringomyelia. Malformations of the central nervous system among patients with scoliosis are very difficult to diagnose on the basis of clinical and radiological examination. MRI examination is a useful tool in diagnosing neurogenic malformations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of neurogenic malformations in a group of patients with scoliosis, and the evaluation of shared clinical symptoms in this group. Material and methods. Clinical, radiological and MRI assessment was performed on a group of 323 patients referred to the Clinic due to scoliosis with a Cobb angle > 20. Results. Four patients were diagnosed with syringomyelia, 1 had a Chiari malformation type I and 1 female patient aged 14 was diagnosed with tethered cord. Conclusions. In the group, the prevalence of neurogenic malformation was 1.9%. MRI examination in patients with scoliosis seems to be justified in the following cases: clinical findings suggests a neurogenic background of spine deformation; scoliosis with onset before 8 years of age; prior to the planned surgical correction of scoliosis.
