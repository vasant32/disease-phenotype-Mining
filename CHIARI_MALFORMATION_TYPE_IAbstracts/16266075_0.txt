The authors discuss the results obtained in patients who underwent foramen magnum decompression for longstanding advanced Chiari I malformation in which marked spinal cord atrophy was present. This 50-year-old woman presented with progressive quadriparesis and sensory disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the descent of cerebellar tonsils and medulla associated with remarkable C1-L2 spinal cord atrophy. After a C-1 laminectomy-based foramen magnum decompression, arachnoid dissection and duraplasty were undertaken. These procedures resulted in remarkable neurological improvement, even after 40 years of clinical progression. Spinal cord atrophy may be caused by chronic pressure of entrapped cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal canal.
