The authors describe a case of noncommunicating syringomyelia associated with Chiari malformation Type I in a patient in whom acute symptomatic exacerbation occurred following cervical spine trauma. Surgical stabilization and realignment of the spine resulted in marked resolution of the neurological abnormalities, and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated persistent collapse of the syrinx. The authors review the various factors in the pathogenesis of this unusual sequence of events.
