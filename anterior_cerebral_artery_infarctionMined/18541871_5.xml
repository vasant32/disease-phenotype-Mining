<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms and clinical features of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory infarction have rarely been investigated using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To verify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms and to make clinical imaging correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical, MRI, and angiographic findings of 100 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ACA infarction</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Motor dysfunction (n = 91) was the most common symptom, and severe motor dysfunction was related to supplementary motor area/paracentral lobule involvement (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypobulia/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> (n = 43) was related to involvement of frontal pole (p = 0.002), corpus callosum/cingulate gyrus (p = 0.003), and superior frontal gyrus (p &lt; 0.001), and occurred more frequently in patients with bilateral lesions followed by left lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>Urinary incontinence</z:hpo> (n = 30) was not related to any specific lesion locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grasp reflex (n = 25) was related to corpus callosum involvement (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic (mostly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography) results showed that 68 patients had local ACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, most often at A2 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms included cardiogenic embolism in 10, internal carotid artery-ACA embolism in 6, and ACA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 61 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, detailed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms included local branch occlusion (n = 20), in situ thrombotic occlusion (n = 20), artery-to-artery embolism (n = 12), and a combination (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with intrinsic ACA disease more often had hypobulia (p = 0.077) and corpus callosal involvement (p = 0.016) than those with embolism either from the internal carotid artery or the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is the most important <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology in our population, causing infarction with various mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Topographic lesion patterns and consequent clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ACA infarction</z:e> are determined by diverse pathogenic mechanisms and the status of collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
