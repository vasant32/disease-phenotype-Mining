<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current interpretation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e> holds that whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp> correlates with destruction of the corticospinal tract at the paracentral lobe, faciobrachial symptoms indicate extension of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to the upper lateral convexity or to subcortical structures, where the corticospinal tract subserving the arm would be interrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the motor behavior in eight patients with purely medial hemispheric infarctions who had face, arm, and leg involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In addition to careful clinical testing, we performed neuroimaging or pathological studies to exclude the involvement of the primary motor cortex or subcortical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Motor function was further tested in three patients by studying the reaction time to an auditory stimulus and by stimulating the motor cortex and the cervical and lumbar spine with a magnetic stimulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had signs of motor neglect, such as lack of spontaneous movement in the upper limb, unilateral reaction to pain stimuli, clumsy voluntary movements, or motor impairment on bimanual tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologically, we found absent or poor voluntary activity in both upper and lower limbs contralateral to the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, whereas cortical stimulation showed absent responses in the lower limb, it disclosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> latencies in the upper limb, indicating that the corticospinal tract to paretic muscles of the upper limb was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that faciobrachial symptoms in purely medial hemispheric infarctions in the anterior cerebral artery territory reflect motor neglect caused not by involvement of primary motor pathways but by damage to medial premotor areas </plain></SENT>
