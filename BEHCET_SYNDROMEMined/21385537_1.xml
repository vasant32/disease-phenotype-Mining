<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Given the pathological similarities between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>), TNF receptor-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) we evaluated the frequency of mutations and polymorphisms in MEFV, TNFRSF1A and CARD15 in Israeli BD patients of either Jewish or Arab descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four BD patients (11 Jews and 43 Arabs), evaluated with respect to the entire spectrum of BD disease manifestations, were granted a systemic severity score for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An association between BD manifestations and MEFV, TNFRSF1A and CARD15 variants was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (20.7%) displayed a single MEFV mutation and four patients (7.4%) had two mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients (3.8%) carried a CARD15 variation and none carried a TNFRSF1A polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency and distribution of mutated alleles between patients and controls was comparable (p=0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences between carriers and non-carriers with respect to disease manifestations and severity score were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arab patients were diagnosed earlier than Jewish patients (25.8±11.6 and 37.2±10.7, respectively, p=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The overall MEFV high carrier frequency in our cohort of BD patients seems to be attributed to their Mediterranean extraction rather than related to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The propensity of Arab patients (79.6%) in a cohort of BD patients from northern Israel is highlighted in face of their proportion (20%) in the general population lending further support to arguments that favour a genetic component for BD </plain></SENT>
