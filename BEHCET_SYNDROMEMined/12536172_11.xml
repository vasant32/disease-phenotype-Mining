<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of an open trial of 54 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> for aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the long and short term efficacy and tolerance of this molecule in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The case reports of 64 patients presenting with severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> between 1986 and 2000 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only immunocompetent patients exhibiting idiopathic aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were excluded: 4 cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, 4 cases of aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> secondary to a hematological cause and 2 patients who were lost to follow-up after 3 month's treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> was prescribed at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/d for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were assessed after 3 month's treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were contacted by phone in May 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our end-point criteria were: the frequency and duration of the episodes, intensity of pain and impact on the quality of life of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included: 39 women (mean age=44 +/- 16.8) and 15 men (mean age=49 +/- 13.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disease had progressed for a mean of 11.6 +/- 13.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 3 month's treatment, 12 patients (22 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>100) no longer had aphta and were in complete remission, 22 patients (41 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>100) were significantly improved, since the frequency and duration of the lesions had decreased by at least 50 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>100 and the latter were no longer painful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment failed or tolerance was poor in 20 patients (37 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored and assessed for a mean of 4.7 years (range: 6 months to 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Six patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Three patients (6 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>100) were considered as cured, since they were still in complete remission after suspension of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> respectively 6, 24 and 72 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (31 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>100) had still improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Among the latter, 10 continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> for a mean of 27 months, and 5 patients stopped treatment, which they considered tedious, after a mean of 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These 15 patients noted a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the subjective end-point criteria had improved significantly for them not to wish to change treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (63 p </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Some benign adverse events were noted in 10 patients (18.5 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>100) and led to suspension of treatment in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study, which is the first in size (n=54) and duration of follow-up (4.7 years), showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> is an efficient preventive treatment of severe aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> for 63 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>100 of patients after 3 month's treatment and that this improvement was lasting in 37 p </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> should therefore be proposed in first intention in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo>, since it is effective, well tolerated and easy to use </plain></SENT>
