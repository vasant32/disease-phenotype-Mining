<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and types of vascular involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 2319 patients diagnosed with BD according to the criteria of the International Study Group for BD, 332 patients (279 male, 53 female) with vascular involvement were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of vascular involvement was 14.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular involvement was found to be more common in males (P&lt;0.001, male:female ratio 5.26:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vascular involvement was 30.58+/-7.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular lesion was the presenting sign of BD in 50 patients (2.1%), whereas in 109 patients (4.7%) it started together with other clinical symptoms at the age of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Superficial vein <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) was the most common vascular symptom (53.3%) followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) (29.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial lesions were rare (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients 13.3% had more than one type of vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower extremities were the most frequent localization in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, whereas the femoral vein was mainly involved in patients with DVT and the pulmonary artery was mainly involved in the patients with arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In countries like Turkey where BD is more frequent, young male patients presenting with vascular involvement should be evaluated for BD </plain></SENT>
