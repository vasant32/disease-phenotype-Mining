<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble serum thrombomodulin (sTM), a promising marker of endothelial cell injury, is released into the circulating blood following cell damage and was therefore investigated as a parameter of disease activity in patients with Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>) and various other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven sera of 102 patients with histologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> of different disease activity and 41 sera of patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> at their active stage were investigated (12 Takayasu <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> [TA], 7 giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e>], 10 polyarteritis nodosa [<z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>], 12 Behcet's disease [BD]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sera were examined for the levels of sTM and sE-selectin (CD62E) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for the presence of classical anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (cANCA) by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease activity was evaluated according to the clinical symptoms and organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant increase of sTM levels compared with control values (26 +/- 2 ng/ml) was found in active <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, TA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>, and BD: limited active <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>: 63 +/- ng/ml; generalized active <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>: 119 +/- 15 ng/ml; limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, partial remission: 60 +/- 5 ng/ml; generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, partial remission: 75 +/- 7 ng/ml; active TA: 36 +/-; active <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCA</z:e>: 36 +/- 4 ng/ml, active <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>: 33 +/- 2 ng/ml, active BD: 40 +/- 4 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Limited and generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> in complete remission did not have elevated levels of sTM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>sTM values closely reflected relapses and therapy-induced remissions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated cANCA titers were correlated as well with the disease activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> but more weakly than sTM levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sE-selectin values were not significantly correlated with the disease activity and the course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: sTM is a promising serological marker of disease activity and progression in active limited and generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> reflecting the degree of endothelial cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>sTM might prove to be a clinically useful marker for therapeutic considerations </plain></SENT>
