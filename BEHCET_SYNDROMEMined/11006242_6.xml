<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prospectively determine, using two different assays, the lymphocyte proliferative response to a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> autoantigen (S-antigen) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who are under treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were evaluated at each visit for signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood leukocytes were harvested and cultured in the presence of bovine S-antigen in a standard culture assay, as well as by limiting dilution using multiple short-term T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients were observed for 2 to 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, three patients had episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No consistent change in proliferative response was observed in standard proliferation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, an increase in established T-cell lines was correlated to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ocular activity was associated with an increase of 9- to 30-fold in the frequency of short-term T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase returned to baseline within 1 to 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increase in S-antigen-responsive lymphocytes is found in the peripheral blood of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease during episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increase cannot be measured using standard proliferation assays but requires the use of techniques exploiting the principles of limiting dilution analysis </plain></SENT>
