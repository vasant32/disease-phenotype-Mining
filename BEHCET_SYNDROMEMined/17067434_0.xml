<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate and clinical correlations of antibodies against saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) among healthy family members of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one BD patients and 52 healthy family members (HFM) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from medical files and from patients' interviews was collected, regarding the entire spectrum of disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each family member was personally interviewed and a questionnaire composed of BD symptoms and their temporal relation was compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgA- and IgG-ASCA levels, determined by ELISA, were studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BD patients and their family members, the results were compared to a group of 23 healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight (38.1%) BD patients were ASCA positive, compared to five among HFM (9.6%) and none among healthy unrelated controls (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean IgG and IgA-ASCA levels were significantly higher in BD patients compared with HFM and HC groups (p = 0.002 and p = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between positive ASCA tests and any of BD-related manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean IgG-ASCA levels were significantly lower in HFM compared to BD patients (p = 0.03), yet IgA-ASCA levels were similar in HFM and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean IgG and IgA-ASCA levels were higher in HFM compared with healthy unrelated controls (p=0.09 and p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in ASCA rates between relatives of BD patients who had positive or negative ASCA tests, or between spouses of BD patients and genetically related relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In HFM with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> there was a positive correlation between titers of IgA-ASCA and the yearly number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> episodes (p = 0.01), and mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> healing time (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IgG-ASCA titers correlated with yearly number of aphtae episodes (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm our previous observation on a high prevalence of ASCA in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ASCA levels are also increased in healthy family members of BD patients, and are probably influenced by genetic as well as environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>ASCA in HFM were significantly associated with a more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The role of ASCA as a marker for predisposition to develop future BD remains to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
