<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>3 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were studied for their fibrinolytic status during exacerbation of the disease accompanied with thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients exhibited low euglobulin fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This, however, could be attributed to an artificially increased coprecipitation of inhibitors, i.e., C1-inactivator in the euglobulin fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon correlated with and was possibly related to inflammatory reactions in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most severely diseased patient only showed an increased plasmin inhibition in the plasma and a decreased response to venous occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased plasmin inhibition was due to a slow type of inhibition, which could not be attributed to known <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its physiological relevance to fibrinolysis is questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for relevant general deviations in the fibrinolytic system in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease; only for the severe case may the decreased fibrinolytic potency revealed by venous occlusion have contributed to the extent of the thrombotic manifestations </plain></SENT>
