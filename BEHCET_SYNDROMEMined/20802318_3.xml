<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the measurements of central corneal thickness (CCT) in uveitic eyes with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (BD) and compare it with age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 69 eyes with ocular BD with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corneal disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, or ocular surgery and 50 eyes of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eyes with ocular BD were subdivided into active and inactive groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active group was defined as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>, whereas inactive group was defined as having had at least 1 previous attack and absence of any active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the eye within the last 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CCT was measured with ultrasonic pachymeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Active group had 24 patients and inactive group had 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics of patients with ocular BD and control subjects were similar (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in respect to the disease duration between active and inactive groups (P = 0.160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean CCT was significantly greater in active group (584.75 ± 20.94 μm) than in inactive group (540.55 ± 36.16 μm) and control group (543.04 ± 25.35 μm) (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that eyes with active BD had increased CCT because of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> when compared with inactive and control groups, and mean CCT of inactive BD was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assume that CCT is in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in the inactive phase, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> does not lead to a permanent change in CCT in BD </plain></SENT>
