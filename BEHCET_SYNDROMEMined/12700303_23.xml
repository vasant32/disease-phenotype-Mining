<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of neurological involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in a prospective study, and to describe the clinical patterns of neurological presentation in this disease in patients attending a multidisciplinary clinic in Baghdad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients attending the clinic who fulfilled the international study group criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were studied during a two year period starting in April 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed neurologically by a neuro-Behcetologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> those with clinical neurological manifestations were sent for CSF examination, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance venography and were followed up to explore the patterns of neurological relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 140 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 34.2 years (range 16 to 66); 105 (75%) were men and 35 (25%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of the disease was 4.2 years (range 0.4 to 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (14%) had neurological involvement (neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>); 14 of these (70%) were men and six (30%) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the first neurological presentation was 34.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow up of patients with neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> was 20.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (50%) presented with parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, six (30%) with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and four (20%) with a mixed pattern of both parenchymal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Careful neurological assessment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> may show a relatively high prevalence of neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> features, and though the clinical patterns of presentation are characteristic a mixed pattern may occur </plain></SENT>
