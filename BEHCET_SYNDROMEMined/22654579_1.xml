<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHOD: The pMRI were performed in 34 patients with BD and 16 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on neurologic examination and post-contrast MRI, 12 patients were classified as Neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> (group 1, NBD) and 22 patients as BD without neurological involvement (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were obtained and compared to those of healthy control group (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and rCBF within the pons and parietal cortex in groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rCBV increased in cerebral pedicle in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the temporal lobe white matter, prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and decreased rCBF were found in groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the corpus striatum, internal capsule, and periventricular white matter, rCBF increased in group 1 compared with group 3 and decreased in groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain pMRI is a very sensitive method to detect brain involvement in patients with BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> the clinical diagnosis of NBD, especially in patients with negative MRI findings </plain></SENT>
