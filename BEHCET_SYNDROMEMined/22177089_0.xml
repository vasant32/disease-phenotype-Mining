<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six patients admitted to the BD and NBD Outpatient Clinics, and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum CX3CL1 levels were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the serum CX3CL1 levels of control subjects, and patients with active and inactive BD or NBD, regardless of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing CX3CL1 levels in patients with BD and NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that serum CX3CL1 levels were not changed in active and inactive BD and NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, further large-scale studies are needed to confirm our results </plain></SENT>
