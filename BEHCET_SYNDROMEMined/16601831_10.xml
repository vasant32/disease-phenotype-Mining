<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prothrombotic mechanisms are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombophilic defects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> may be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events, although results have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no information is available on this issue for eastern Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of inherited and acquired thrombophilic risk factors in 79 patients with BD (43 men, 36 women) who had (n = 23) or did not have (n = 56) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and in 84 healthy control subjects (42 men, 42 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors examined were antithrombin, protein C and protein S levels, factor V Leiden, the prothrombin G20210A mutation, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase C677T polymorphism, and acquired thrombophilic risk factors, including anticardiolipin antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between patients and controls in any of the parameters studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we studied BD patients with and without thrombotic events, the only thrombophilic defect that differed was the prothrombin G20210A mutation: Three out of 23 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were carriers, compared with none of 56 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the three carriers developed catastrophic or recurrent thrombotic episodes; one was a homozygous carrier of the G20210A prothrombin mutation and the other was doubly heterozygous for the G20210A prothrombin mutation and factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis demonstrated an association of factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When studies from Turkey were excluded from the meta-analysis, only the prothrombin G20210A mutation was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
