<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> lesions occur in 5 to 7% of patients and are the most severe manifestations of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of patients with neurological manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease evaluated in the Neuroradiology Department of Garcia de Orta Hospital and the MRI center of Caselas, Portugal, between 1994 and January 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 8 cases of Neuro- <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 4 males and 4 females (male/female ratio = 1:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases (37.5%) there was brainstem involvement, the basal ganglia and thalamus were affected in 2 cases (25%) and the internal capsule and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata in 2 cases (25%) </plain></SENT>
