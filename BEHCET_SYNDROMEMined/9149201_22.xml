<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> is a major component of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to estimate the effect of this entity upon the clinical features and course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During an 8-yr period from 1985 to 1994, from a total of 493 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease seen at Hacettepe University Hospital, the incidence and effect of hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on the clinical course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in each case was documented by hepatic venography and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography, computed tomography, ultrasonography, and liver biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coagulation parameters including protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III levels were easured in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival of cases with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> and the effect of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> on the survival of individuals with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome were determined using the Kaplan-Meier technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 493 cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, 53 (10.8%) were found to have one or more large vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 53 patients, 14 (26.4%) had hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 14 patients, 8 had an additional inferior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 4 had portal vein as well as total inferior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only two patients with isolated hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These two patients and two additional patients with hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> plus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the hepatic portion of the inferior vena cava are currently alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients with total inferior vena cava and hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (4 also had portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 died with a mean survival of 10.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the same time period, 37 patients obtained from a total of 1494 patients with clinical evidence of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic venous outflow obstruction</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inferior vena caval obstruction</z:e> without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome were found to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of these 37 patients, 19 (51%) had an identifiable underlying disorder responsible for their hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based upon this experience, it appears as if <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> is a relatively frequent complication of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When individuals with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome have BCS, concurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the portal vein and inferior vena cava are often found, if the patency of these vessels is assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The extent of the vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> within the inferior vena cava rather than the presence of the hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> per se is the major determinant of survival </plain></SENT>
