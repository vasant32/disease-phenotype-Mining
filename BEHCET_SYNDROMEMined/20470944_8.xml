<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the association between polymorphism in the TNF gene at the locations -308, -238, -863, -857 and -1031 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature review was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for original studies published in English up to October 31, 2009 and that examined the association of the TNF-alpha promoter polymorphisms with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pooled odds ratios (OR) were derived from random-effects model with its 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed statistical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among studies using Cochrane Q test and by calculating I(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cochrane collaboration's software program, RevMan 5 was used to prepare and complete this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 13 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten studies met the included criteria and thus were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, -1031C (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.09-1.68), -238A (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.12-2.04) and -857T (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58-0.98) had a significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pooled estimates for the other polymorphisms were not statistically significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>; -308A and -863A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> was associated with the -1031C, -238A and the -857T promoter polymorphisms in various ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
