<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported distinct symptom clusters among our patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of such clusters suggests that more than one pathogenetic mechanism might be operative in BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increases in the frequency of certain clusters in familial BS cases, if present, would further support this notion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we compared the frequency of symptom clusters between familial (group F) and non-familial (group NF) cases of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 380 BS patients who had reported a first-degree relative by reviewing 6031 patient charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were able to contact 186 (Group F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the same initial pool, 500 patients were randomly selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those, patients who did not report a family history of BS and who had attended our clinic during the previous 3 months made up group NF (n = 221) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups were questioned about their symptoms within the previous 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed using factor analysis, cluster analysis and χ2 tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The make-up of the symptom clusters were very similar for the factor and the cluster analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of papulopustular lesions and joint involvement cluster was significantly higher in group F (39.2 vs. 21.5%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the same cluster was shared in 5/17 related pairs from group F and in only 5/110 unrelated pairs from group NF [29 vs. 4.5%, P = 0.004; risk ratio (RR) = 6.47, 95% CI 2.15, 18.89] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The papulopustular lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> cluster in BS appears to cluster in familial BS as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This further supports the notion that the pathogenesis of BS may entail several distinct mechanisms resulting in separate phenotype clusters </plain></SENT>
