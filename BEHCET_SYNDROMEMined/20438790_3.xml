<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of rs7574865 polymorphism in the STAT4 gene was performed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms in 379 VKH patients, 366 BD patients, and 414 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the samples, 20% were sequenced to validate polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the influence of the gender on the association of STAT4 polymorphism with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased frequency of TT genotype of the STAT4 rs7574865 was observed in VKH patients (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GT genotypic frequency was significantly lower in BD patients than in controls (p = 0.003) However the significance of rs7574865 was lost in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested BD patients when adjusted for gender (p = 0.775) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower frequency of GT genotype and a significantly higher frequency of GG genotype was found in male BD patients compared with male controls (p = 0.000458 and p = 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002290'>poliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> for BD failed to find any association between the tested single nucleotide polymorphism and any of the extraocular findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TT genotype of rs7574865 may be a susceptible factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e> in a Chinese Han population, and that GG genotype of this SNP may confer susceptibility in male BD patients </plain></SENT>
