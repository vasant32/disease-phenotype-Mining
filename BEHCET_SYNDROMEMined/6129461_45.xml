<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hybridisation of 125I-labelled DNA probes was detected by means of autoradiography and quantitated with a video image-analysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hybridisation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes-simplex</z:e> virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA and the complementary <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in mononuclear cells was significantly greater in 10 of 20 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistently, mononuclear cells from fewer patients showed significant hybridisation with the HSV-2 probe, and the grain counts were also lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control DNA probes from adenovirus 2, bacteriophage lambda, and Micrococcus lysodeikticus did not show significant hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further separation of the patients into the four types of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome revealed that mononuclear cells in 8 of 10 patients with the ocular or arthritic types showed significant hybridisation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to the HSV-1 DNA probe, compared with 2 of 10 patients with the mucocutaneous or neurological types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells from 4 of 8 patients with minor but not major aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> also showed significant <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridisation to HSV-1 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that at least part of the HSV genome is present and transcribed in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells--probably lymphocytes--of patients with the ocular and arthritic types of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and minor aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunopathogenesis of these diseases might therefore be associated with HSV-1 </plain></SENT>
