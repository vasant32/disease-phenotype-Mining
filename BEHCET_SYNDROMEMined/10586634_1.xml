<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His illness began at age 23 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> of the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The last few years he complained of recurrent painful <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> on the mucosa or skin of the mouth and the external genitalia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular involvements are not infrequent in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but we believe such occlusive lesions in the bilateral internal carotid arteries as seen in our case are extremely rare </plain></SENT>
