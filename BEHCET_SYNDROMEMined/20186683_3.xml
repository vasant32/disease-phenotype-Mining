<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the case of a 37-year-old kurdish woman in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcets disease</z:e> was diagnosed in 1998 when she presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (BCS) complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) occurred despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with UFH, LMWH or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> and various immunosuppressive therapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2001, when BCS recurred ultimately i.v. lepirudin was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the patient improved and remained clinically stable lepirudin was applied subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During long-term treatment with twice-daily 50 mg no further VTE was observed over the following years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In May 2005 anticoagulant therapy was switched to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCS reoccurred when INR values were suboptimal in February 2007, and lepirudin treatment was immediately restarted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After admission the patient received 50 mg b.i.d. lepirudin s.c. with plasma levels in the therapeutic range (0.5-1.0 mg / l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the following months, lepirudin levels repeatedly exceeded the upper limit of this range and the dosage was stepwise reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, 20 mg b.i.d. were sufficient to obtain therapeutic levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Renal function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but lepirudin antibodies were present in high titer, as assessed by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suppose that these antibodies reduce renal filtration of lepirudin thus leading to increased plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This case is an example for successful long-term therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with s.c. lepirudin in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcets disease</z:e> and recurrent VTE despite therapeutic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with LMWH or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, frequent measurement of lepirudin plasma levels is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>If stepwise dose lowering is required over time, the presence of lepirudin antibodies should be considered </plain></SENT>
