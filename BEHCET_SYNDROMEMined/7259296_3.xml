<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The same set of in vitro tests (except PMNL exposure to solutions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23414">copper sulfate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi>) was carried out on a control group consisting of more than 100 healthy male and female individuals of various ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apart from general signs of inflammatory activity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, elevation of ESR, increased IgG serum levels), cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> to mild local highly injuries and marked enhancement of PMNL chemotaxis proved to be highly significant symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases of BD in contrast to benign RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both symptoms, in particular the hyperchemotaxis of PMNL, can be regarded as valuable diagnostic means in the early detection of beginning or atypical BD </plain></SENT>
