<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>Vitiligo</z:hpo> is frequently associated with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> such as autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo>, pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008207'>Addison's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our informal observation was that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> is also uncommon among BS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this controlled and masked study we formally surveyed the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> among BS patients and suitable controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo> being followed in the rheumatology and endocrinology departments of a university hospital and healthy controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with hypopigmented lesions were re-examined by a dermatologist in a masked protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wood's lamp was used to confirm the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> in suspected lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 253 consecutive BS patients, 34 Graves' disease patients, 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo> patients, and 439 healthy controls were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the BS patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo>, while 6/34 (17.6%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> patients, 6/32 (18.7%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo> patients, and 4/439 (0.9%) of healthy controls had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo>, except for one patient with associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e>, were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In contrast to two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e>, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> was not increased among patients with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This constitutes further evidence that traditional autoimmune mechanisms may not be operative in BS </plain></SENT>
