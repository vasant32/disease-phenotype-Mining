<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied three groups of women: (1) group A included 61 pregnancies in 23 women with BD, 25 pregnancies took place in 10 patients already diagnosed (group 1A) and 36 pregnancies occurred in 13 patients before disease diagnosis (group 2A); (2) group B included 30 females with 83 pregnancies affected by recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (ROU); (3) group C included 20 healthy women with 61 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of BD on pregnancy and fetal outcome, and the influence of gestation on the course of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was used in which specific information about each pregnancy, labour and puerperium was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We looked for medical confirmation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases where any pathology had been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was also similar and neither congenital abnormalities nor neonatal BD were observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our series, the outcome of pregnancy was generally good in BD patients, disease manifestations were not consistently worsened and fetal outcome was excellent </plain></SENT>
