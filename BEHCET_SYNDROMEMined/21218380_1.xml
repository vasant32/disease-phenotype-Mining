<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated a possible association of C3435T polymorphism of the ABCB1 (MDR1) gene with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> response in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We randomly selected 97 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, examined ABCB1 (MDR1) gene C3435T polymorphisms, and evaluated patient responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> responsive, while the remaining 54 patients were unresponsive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between genotypic and allelic frequencies of the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphisms in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, there was no significant difference among responsive and nonresponsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism is not associated with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> response in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
