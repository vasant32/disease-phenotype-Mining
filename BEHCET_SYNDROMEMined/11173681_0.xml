<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis is based on several signs, generally using the criteria established by the International Group for the Study of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, by O'Duffy, by Hamza, by Mason and Barnes and by the Japanese Committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the frequency of clinical manifestations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to apply the five diagnostic criteria scorings cited above to our patients to determine their sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1988 and December 1997, 110 cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were seen at our Dermatology Unit in Casablanca as inpatients or outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete history and clinical data including results of the ophthalmology exam and skin tests were available for 70 patients (29 men and 41 women, mean age 31 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 70 patients had buccal aphtosis and 88 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>100 had genital aphtosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ocular signs were found in 36 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>100 of the patients and the skin test was positive in 57 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to the criteria of the International Group for the Study of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 65 patients (93 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>100) had <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the Japanese Committee criteria there were 63 (90 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>100), for the O'Duffy criteria 48 (68 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>100), for Hamza criteria 45 (64 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>100) and for Mason and Barnes criteria 35 (50 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our series is comparable to other Mediterranean series observed in dermatology units, but our patients had fewer systemic manifestations compared with another Moroccan series reported from an internal medicine ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This could be due to recruitment bias and different medical education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For positive diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, the criteria established by the International Group for the Study of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, the Japanese Committee, O'Duffy and Hamza enabled the diagnosis in the majority of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the criteria described in these scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These criteria would appear to be both overly descriptive, with the risk of confounding other <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> such as enterocolopathy, or underly descriptive, making it impossible to classify certain patients as having <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
