<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Polarization assay is an excellent method for detecting neutrophil polarization in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and is useful to make a differential diagnosis between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
