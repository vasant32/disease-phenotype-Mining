<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Juvenile BD is rare and only small series of pediatric cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to define the epidemiology and clinical features of BD among Israeli children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 8 pediatric rheumatology units in Israel and 30 cases of BD diagnosed before the age of 16 years were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for BD, while 15 had an incomplete form of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with complete BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> and skin involvement were the most common manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and gastrointestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive family history was elicited in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA B5 was found in 7 of 12 patients (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 15 patients with incomplete BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>; other manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HLA B5 was found in 94% of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Juvenile BD in Israel is not uncommon, and is frequently associated with HLA B5 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This could indicate a genetic susceptibility in our region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Half of the patients in our series had an incomplete form of BD, which may represent a less severe variant of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In any case, careful follow-up is required, since their condition could eventually evolve into complete BD </plain></SENT>
