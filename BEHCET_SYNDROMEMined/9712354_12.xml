<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the influence of the MICB gene, located about 120 kb centromeric of the HLA-B gene, on the susceptibility to BD, (CA/TG) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat microsatellite polymorphism in intron 1 of the MICB gene was investigated among 77 Japanese patients with BD, 60 randomly selected controls and 28 HLA-B51-positive unrelated healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the phenotype frequency of the microsatellite polymorphism between the BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that the MICB gene itself is not responsible for the development of BD, and that the candidate gene(s) for BD is located between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> and HLA-C genes </plain></SENT>
