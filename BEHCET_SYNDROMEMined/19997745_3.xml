<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent publications have suggested considerable improvements in the clinical outcomes of ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term time course of clinical ocular features of BD in recent cases remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated annual time-course changes of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) during ocular convalescent stages, as well as annual frequency of ocular attacks during the initial 10 years of follow-up in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 75 eyes in 39 patients (31 men, eight women) with BD, who were referred to our hospital between 1980 and 1996 within 1 year after the initial ocular attack and followed them up continuously for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical courses of BCVA at the ocular convalescent stage from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ocular disease were retrospectively examined, and the numbers of ocular attacks per eye per year were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean BCVA was 0.59 at 1 year, 0.31 at 3 years, and 0.12 at 10 years from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ocular disease, while the numbers of ocular attacks per eye were 4.1 +/- 3.1 at 1 year, 2.2 +/- 1.9 at 5 years, and 1.4 +/- 1.8 at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ocular attacks were still observed in 33 eyes (45%) of 21 patients (54%) with BD even after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final BCVA in 42 eyes (56%) became lower than 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major reasons for poor visual prognosis were macular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (41%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000533'>chorioretinal atrophy</z:hpo> (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The decline of BVCA continued, and nearly half the patients still suffered from ocular attacks at 10 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ocular BD </plain></SENT>
