<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*5101 was also the predominant allele in HLA-B51-positive healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*5108 and B*5104 alleles were identified in 23% and 15% of B51-positive BD patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HLA-B*5201 allele was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HLA-B52-positive patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that both HLA-B*5101 and HLA-B*5201 are the dominant alleles of HLA-B5 in Israeli BD patients </plain></SENT>
