<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 73 patients with BD (45 patients were in active stage), 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and 12 multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> patients (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with BD were investigated both in their active and remission stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were processed to detect IL-17A level in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Related gene expression was assessed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Function of Th17 cells in active BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN)-like eruption was studied in relation to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated the presence of Th17 cells and RORγt among the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of circulating Th17 cells and the ability to produce interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were increased in samples derived from patients with active BD, MS and SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed that IL-17A from patients with active BD could induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression in HUVECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RORγt determined Th17 cell might be involved with increased IL-17A in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that IL-17 contributes to the active proinflammatory pattern that is characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> and patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
