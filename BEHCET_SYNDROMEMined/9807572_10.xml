<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze the computed tomographic (CT) features of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome and to determine the usefulness of CT in detecting complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT scans of 28 patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients had bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patterns of bowel involvement, patterns of contrast enhancement, and ancillary findings were compared in patients with complications (n = 7) and patients without complications (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients had polypoid lesions, nine had a thickened bowel wall, and nine had both findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion enhancement was mild in eight patients (29%) and marked in 20 (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polypoid lesions were more commonly seen in patients without complications (P = .020); a thickened bowel wall was more commonly seen in patients with complications (P = .030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 18 patients (94%) with minimal perienteric infiltration did not have complications (P = .0003), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients with severe perienteric infiltration did have complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with known intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, CT can be useful in determining the extent of the lesions and in identifying cases in which complications are likely to occur </plain></SENT>
