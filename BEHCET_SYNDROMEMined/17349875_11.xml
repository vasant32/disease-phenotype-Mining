<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports focused on the genetic factors of susceptibility to this disease and especially the TNF in view of the major role played by this proinflammatory cytokine in the lesional process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we investigated the possible association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and the TNF-alpha gene promoter polymorphisms -1031T/C, -308A/G, and the TNF-beta polymorphism +252A/G in Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the distribution of these polymorphisms between 89 BD patients and 157 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length-polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the TNF-alpha -1031C allele was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.015; chi(2) = 5.84; OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.08-2.54), whereas the frequencies of the TNF-alpha -308G and the TNF-beta +252G alleles were similar in the two compared groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the variability of the TNF-alpha -1031T/C polymorphism can be associated with the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the TNF molecule may have an important genetically and/or functionally implication in the pathogenesis of BD in the Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
