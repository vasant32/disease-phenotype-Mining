<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now several laser flare photometers have been developed and are in use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LFP is not yet used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> centres and, in order to understand this reluctance and know whether use of LFP is justified and should be recommended, an expert meeting was deemed necessary leading to this publication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides others results included the following: There is variation between users with regard to how many readings are necessary varying from 3 to 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It appears appropriate to use at least 6-10 readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LFP is most useful in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with posterior and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo>, at least 15 photons in the anterior chamber is considered the necessary threshold to be reliable to monitor evolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing the measurement of LFP are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007759'>corneal opacity</z:hpo>, pupil size, intraocular lens and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000594'>shallow anterior chamber</z:hpo> but this is mostly irrelevant in pathological situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LFP can be used to adjust the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, but not necessarily influence treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exceptions may be patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LFP results should always be interpreted in conjunction with the usually clinical observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence that worsening of the flare on two consecutive visits is predictive of a relapse, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LFP maybe also useful for predicting rejection of corneal transplant when the cornea is not thickened </plain></SENT>
