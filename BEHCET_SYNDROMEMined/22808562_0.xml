<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It is known that clinical similarities between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> have led to the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> is caused by MEFV gene mutations coding for pyrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined whether these pyrin mutations are also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Molecular testing for pyrin mutations was performed in 96 unrelated Greek patients with an established diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcets disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with an analysis for pyrin mutations in 140 unrelated healthy Greek controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no pyrin mutations among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> cases tested; this result is comparable with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pyrin gene mutations in Greek patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> are not more common than those in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding is not in agreement with the findings in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that screening for pyrin mutations not be included in the evaluation of Greeks suspected to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
