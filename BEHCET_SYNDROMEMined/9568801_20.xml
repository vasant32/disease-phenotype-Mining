<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors and infectious agents seem to be related to the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BD is strongly associated with HLA-B51 antigen in many ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As there are differences in HLA profile in different ethnic groups, we designed this case-control study to examine the association of HLA-B51 alleles and BD as well as to investigate the influence of sex, age at development of the International Study Group (ISG) for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease criteria and certain features of disease severity on the strength of this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study includes 62 Greek BD patients who fulfill the ISG criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 87 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serological HLA Class-I typing was performed by standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-DNA typing for the B5 group was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B51 subjects and controls by PCR-SSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allele B*5101 was found in 80% of BD patients and in 26% of controls (odds ratio (OR) 10.48, p &lt; 10[-6]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Males who carry this allele have a higher risk than females for BD (OR 16.97 and 5.74 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B*5101 predisposes to BD at a younger age in both sexes and to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (OR = 11, p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A weak but not significant association was found between B*5101 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (OR = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No association was found between B*5101 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in either sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that in the Greek population allele B*5101 is a predisposing marker for BD, as in most ethnic groups, and that this allele predisposes to the development of the disease at a younger age in both sexes and to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum </plain></SENT>
