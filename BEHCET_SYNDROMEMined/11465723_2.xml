<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immune mechanism underlying B lymphocyte proliferation in the synovium is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis involves nonspecific polyclonal activation and another involves antigen-driven activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to test both hypotheses and identify immunoglobulin genes that are clonally expanded in the synovium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and synovial cells from a patient with BD and PBL from a healthy control subject were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) fingerprinting analysis and nucleotide sequence analysis of Ig transcripts derived from clonally expanded B lymphocytes were performed in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 44 mu heavy chain clones of the VH4 family identified in the synovial tissue from the BD patient, 8 clones showed identical nucleotide sequences, and therefore, 18.2% were clonally expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For y heavy chain, 4 of 50 clones of the VH3 family showed nearly identical sequences; therefore, 4-8% were clonally expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The kappa light chain did not show a dominant band, but a clone with a 12-amino acid CDR3 showed 3% clonal expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>Somatic mutations</z:hpo> were frequently observed, with a high ratio of replacement to silent mutations in the CDRs compared with the framework regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three Ig genes expressed in the clonally expanded B lymphocytes were derived from germline gene segments reported to be involved in the production of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that antigen-driven clonal B lymphocyte proliferation occurs in the synovium in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin transcripts clonally expanded in the synovium were identified </plain></SENT>
