<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This variability could affect the ability to diagnose the disease in certain areas by using standardized criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of cutaneous lesions in patients from the United States, where the disease is less prevalent, is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the frequency and type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in a series of patients with BD from the United States and to identify methods of confirmation of these lesions as part of the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cutaneous manifestations were present in 64% of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinicians most often relied on their clinical diagnosis to identify lesions as part of the spectrum of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy specimens were generally nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cutaneous manifestations were common in patients with BD from the United States and usually were necessary to fulfill the diagnostic criteria of the disease in most cases </plain></SENT>
