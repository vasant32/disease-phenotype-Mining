<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty BD patients (23 males, 17 females; mean age 40.2+/-8.4 years) and 60 healthy controls (HC) (34 males, 26 females; mean age 41.6+/-6.9 years) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the BD patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), as confirmed by Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rates of homozygosity for the MTHFR C677T mutation in the BD and HC groups were 7.5% and 10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of MTHFR genotypes was similar in the two groups ( p&gt;0.05), and analysis showed that homozygosity for the mutation was not a risk factor for DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were 13.4+/-4.2 micro mol/l for the overall BD patients and 12.6+/-3.8 micromol/l for HC ( p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level in the BD patients with DVT history (15.9+/-4.6 micromol/l) was significantly higher than the level in the BD patients with no DVT history (12.1+/-3.3 micromol/l) ( p=0.013) and the level in the HC group (12.6+/-3.8 micromol/l) ( p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
