<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We aimed to investigate subclinical neurological involvement in patients who were suffering from BD and who had no neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 49 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the investigation of subclinical neurological involvement, the patients received imaging and/or neurophysiologic evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation techniques were as follows: single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, 33 patients; cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 25 patients; brainstem auditory evoked potential examination, 36 patients; and electroencephalography (EEG), 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum W test were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the MRI and EEG groups showed significantly more abnormalities than did age- and gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of neurological involvement in BD is important in reducing or preventing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cranial MRI and EEG were found to be useful for detecting subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
