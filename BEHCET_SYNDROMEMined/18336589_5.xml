<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The involvement of excessive T helper 1 (Th1) cell functions in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied Toll-like receptor (TLR)-expressing cells, which play important roles in innate immunity in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of BD and healthy controls, and tissue specimens of intestinal BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) were analysed for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and protein expressions by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PBMC of BD expressed TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA almost comparable with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intestinal lesions of BD expressed TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA consistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TLR-4 mRNA was expressed preferentially and TLR-2 mRNA was expressed less frequently in CD lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In intestinal samples of BD, TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA were detected in ileocaecal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> lesions, but not in unaffected sites of the same sample, indicating the association of the TLR expression with the disease manifestation of intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TLR-2-expressing cells which were simultaneously cluster of distribution (CD)68-positive produced interleukin (IL)-12 in the lesions, indicating the participation of TLR-2-expressing cells in the Th1 skewed responses in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a possible ligand of TLR-2, in BD self-heat shock protein 60 was expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes and intestinal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, TLR-2-expressing cells as well as TLR-4-expressing cells accumulated in the intestinal lesions of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IL-12 produced by TLR-2-expressing cells may contribute to the induction of Th1-dominant immune responses in intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
