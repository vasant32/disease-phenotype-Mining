<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the endovascular repair of dual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> along a femorodistal venous bypass graft in a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old man of middle European ancestry with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had dual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> evolve along the proximal segment of a femorodistal venous bypass that had been implanted 2.5 years earlier for recurrent false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Owing to the lack of suitable venous conduits and the active nature of the disease, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully excluded with overlapping Hemobahn and Jostent endografts; the immunosuppressive therapy was intensified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was successfully prevented, but the stent-grafts thrombosed 6 weeks later owing to exacerbation of the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in venous bypass grafts in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the stent-grafts thrombosed, they did prevent rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
