<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> which modulates the tissue factor (TF) dependent pathway, acting on the factor VIIa/TF complex, factor Xa, and thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although most TFPI is found in association with plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and platelets, the functional pool is bound to vascular endothelium and is released into the circulation on stimulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the vascular endothelial TFPI pool in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma TFPI concentrations were determined before, and 20 and 60 minutes after subcutaneous LMWH injection in 15 newly diagnosed patients with BD and 12 with SLE, and in 12 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline median TFPI was 149.5 ng/ml in healthy subjects, and the percentage change in TFPI at 20 minutes (((value at 20th min - baseline value)/baseline value) x 100) was 575.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TFPI concentrations in patients with BD were initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at baseline (136.0 ng/ml), but the percentage change (44.7) was significantly lower than in the patients with SLE and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline TFPI concentrations in patients with SLE (83.0 ng/ml) were lower than in the control group, but the TFPI response to stimulation with LMWH reached a level (626.4%) comparable to that of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of the functional endothelial pool in BD and low circulating concentrations of TFPI despite an intact pool in SLE may be important in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these vasculitic syndromes </plain></SENT>
