<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the vascular hemodynamic changes that can be detected with color Doppler imaging (CDI) in diagnosis, differential diagnosis and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> with different etiologies including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four groups consisting of healthy volunteers, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients with different etiologies and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with and without ocular involvement were examined by CDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (CRA), posterior ciliary artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein (CRV) flow velocities and vascular resistances were measured prospectively by a radiologist blinded to the presence and etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities in CRA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with ocular involvement were significantly lower than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities in CRA were lower than the control group in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients without ocular involvement (p &lt; 0.001) but there were no differences in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> flow velocity (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> group, CRA and CRV flow velocities were significantly lower than in the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is associated with significant reductions of CRA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> flow velocities when compared with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases without ocular involvement, CRA flow velocities were lower than the control group, but there were no real differences in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that vasculitic involvement of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> is more specific to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and occurs later in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that it may be possible to detect and follow hemodynamic changes in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with CDI before clinical findings of ocular involvement become evident </plain></SENT>
