<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the first MRI, 66 lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were found; each patient had 1-10 lesions (mean 5.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 30 (46%) lesions in the brain stem, 18 (27%) in the basal ganglia region and 18 (27%) in the periventricular white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 22 (33%) were small, 31 (47%) medium-size and 13 (20%) large lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the last MRI, 60 lesions were found: each patient had 1-10 lesions (mean 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this time 31 lesions (52%) were in the brain stem, 13 (22%) in the basal ganglia region and 16 (26%) in the periventricular white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 41 (68%) small, 13 (22%) medium-size and 6 (10%) large lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About 40% of the lesions disappeared, 35% reduced in size and 25% remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No lesion had enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 60 final lesions 20 (34%) were not observed on the first study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Small new lesions were found in 5 of 12 patients (42%), and were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Medium-size or large new lesions were found in 2 patients (17%) who had stopped steroid treatment and had a neurological relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Enlargement of the ventricular system or worsening of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> was observed in 9 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Appearance of small lesions and worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> on long-term follow-up suggest the possibility of subclinical progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo> and should be considered in the prognosis of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
