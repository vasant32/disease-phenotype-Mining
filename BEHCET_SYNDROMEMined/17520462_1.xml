<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense mechanism in the etiopathogenesis of active and inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çets disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In line with this objective, the present study aimed to examine the levels of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), which are the end products of oxidant stress, and vitamins, which are non-enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, for the diagnosis and particularly the follow-up of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of a total of 60 individuals: 40 of whom were <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients and 20 were healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 40 Behçet's patients, 29 had the active and 11 had the inactive (stable) form of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NO (its stable form <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>) levels in the total patient group were statistically significantly higher than those in the control group (p&lt;0.06), there was no statistically significant difference as such between inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and the control group (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vitamin E, C, B1, B2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24041">flavin mononucleotide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17621">FMN</z:chebi>) values were significantly lower in the patient group in comparison with the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in other vitamin values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: It is contemplated that measurement of such <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> factors as <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NO and an accompanying evaluation of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense system can be significant in the diagnosis and treatment follow-up of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
