<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently we have proposed a modified set of criteria to settle the questions raised regarding the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to validate the two pre-existing criteria sets commonly used in Korea, the ISG criteria and the criteria of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Research Committee of Japan (Japanese criteria), as well as the proposed modified criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 155 consecutive patients with BD and 170 controls with non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the subjects were recorded prospectively by the participating physicians on a standard form that listed the clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each set of the criteria were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the three criteria sets employed, the modified criteria were the most accurate, with an accuracy of 96.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ISG criteria often failed to classify the following patients with BD: patients with only oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e>, certain patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal ulcerations</z:e>, patients who did not manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulcerations</z:e>, and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disease but fewer than three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulceration</z:e> relapses in a 1-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Japanese criteria also failed to categorize the following patients with BD: patients with oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e>, and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulcerations</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, and a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Japanese criteria misclassified some of the control subjects with non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> as having BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that there are some points that need to be reconsidered in the clinical application of the two pre-existing sets of criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the modified criteria were the most accurate, further validation studies will be required in other ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
