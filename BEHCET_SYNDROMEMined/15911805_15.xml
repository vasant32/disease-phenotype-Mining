<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies typically demonstrate dermal infiltration with neutrophils in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sweet disease responds to systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> can also be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a survey on neuro-Sweet disease (NSD) in Japan and obtained detailed information about 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They analyzed 42 cases, including 26 cases documented in the literature, and assessed clinical and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen cases also fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of 27 cases, which the authors classified as probable NSD, are as follows: 1) both sexes are almost evenly affected; 2) people of ages 30 to 70 years are affected; 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> are common neurologic manifestations; 4) any region of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> can be involved, resulting in a variety of neurologic symptoms; 5) there is a strong human leukocyte antigen-Cw1 association; 6) systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> are highly effective for most of the neurologic manifestations, although recurrences are not infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuro-Sweet disease is a distinct entity that may account for some cases of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">encephalomeningitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
