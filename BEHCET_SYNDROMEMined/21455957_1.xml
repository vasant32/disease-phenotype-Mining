<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the shape differences of the corpus callosum (CC) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease using statistical shape analysis (SSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, an attempt was made to investigate the changes in CC size according to disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five adults with clinically diagnosed <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 25 age- and gender-matched controls were examined by high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data obtained from the coordinate of landmarks were analyzed with Euclidean distance matrix analysis and a thin-plate spline analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SSA and growth curve models were performed to investigate group differences and to fit the curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was determined between CC shape of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients and controls (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the analysis, a decrease occurred in the CC size of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients as the duration of disease increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum deformations were determined in the landmarks of interior notch of the splenium, inferior tip of the splenium, posterior-most point of the CC, and topmost point of the CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the landmark of anterior-most point of the CC was identified as having the minimum deformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients had significantly different CC shapes from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that SSA is a promising tool for distinguishing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and that it can give useful information to assist clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, SSA might be applied to detect shape differences in anatomical structures that are affected by a broad range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
