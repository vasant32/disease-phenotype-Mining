<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ocular involvement is frequently a clinical challenge because its occurrence often requires changes of the therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are growing evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibitors may be an effective treatment of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNFalpha blocking agents in patients with seronegative spondylo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathies</z:hpo> (SNSA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (BD) associated relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with SNSA had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> and three patients had BD associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (one anterior, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were taking systemic and topical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and three of them were also treated with DMARDs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, sulphasalazine) without clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients received infliximab, an anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody, at a dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight and one patient was treated with etanercept, a TNFalpha receptor p75-Fc fusion protein, at a dosage of 25 mg twice weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both infliximab and etanercept induced a marked improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and none relapse was observed throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were progressively tapered and stopped in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and sulphasalazine were discontinued, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> dose has been reduced by 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with TNFalpha blockers, infliximab and etanercept, was effective and safe in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A complete remission was achieved even in patients with severe steroid resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further controlled studies on larger number of patients are needed to better define the different forms of ocular involvement that can benefit from the therapy with TNFalpha inhibitors </plain></SENT>
