<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is known to be strongly associated with HLA-B51 in many different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, by association analysis using refined microsatellite mapping, the critical region for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was identified as a 46-kb segment centromeric to the HLA-B gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No expressed gene has been detected in this segment to date except the MIC-A (major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A) and HLA-B genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to analyze allelic distribution of the MIC-A gene among Japanese patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-five Japanese patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 116 ethnically matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MIC-A genotyping was performed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products from exons 2, 3, and 4 of the MIC-A gene, using an automated DNA sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MIC-A009 allele was significantly more frequent in the patient group (69.5%) compared with the healthy controls (31.0%) (relative risk 5.06, corrected P = 0.00000024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In stratification analysis on the confounding effect of MIC-A009 on HLA-B*51 association and vice versa, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was distinctively associated only with HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, MIC-A009 was found to be strongly associated not only with HLA-B51, but also with HLA-B52, which was not increased in the patient group to any degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results imply that the real disease susceptibility gene involved in the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is the HLA-B*51 allele itself and that the significant increase of the MIC-A009 allele in the patient group results secondarily from a strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
