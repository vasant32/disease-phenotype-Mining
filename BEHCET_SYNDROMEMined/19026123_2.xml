<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: As heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>) are described as candidate self-antigens in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), free HSP70 and anti-HSP70 levels were measured in the sera of patients to investigate their role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Free human HSP70 levels were measured in the sera of patients with BD and compared to disease controls [patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulcerations</z:e> (ROU)] and healthy controls (HC) using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-HSP70 antibody levels were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Free human HSP70 levels were significantly elevated in BD sera (1.12+/-0.86 ng/ml) compared to HC (0.67+/-0.46 ng/ml, BD vs. HC: p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However similarly elevated levels were also present in ROU (0.95+/-1.01 ng/ml, p&lt;0.05) and RA (1.1+/-23.3 ng/ml, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-HSP70 antibody levels were also significantly higher in BD (668+/-658 microg/ml) compared to HC (490+/-742.05 microg/ml, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However no significant anti-HSP70 antibody responses were observed in ROU (634.7+/-548.21 microg/ml) and RA (431.8+/-840.98 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association of any organ manifestation, the disease duration, or treatment with HSP70 or anti-HSP70 antibody levels were observed in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A correlation between HSP70 and anti-HSP70 levels was only found in HC (p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Free human HSP70 and anti-HSP70 antibodies are both elevated in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HSP70-mediated innate and adaptive immune responses may participate in proinflammatory cytokine activation and tissue destruction in BD </plain></SENT>
