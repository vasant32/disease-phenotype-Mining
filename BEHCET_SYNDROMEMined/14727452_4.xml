<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: IL-18 expression and functional activity has been identified in several autoimmune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the potential role of IL-18 during pulmonary <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), we have explored the capacity of IL-18 to induce the expression of IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 12 patients with BD, 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">silicosis</z:e> as the control disease and 10 BAL from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAL fluid, and BAL fluid cell cultures were investigated for IL-18 estimation by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of IL-18 and IFN-gamma gene expression was carried out before and after LPS stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BD patients had significantly elevated levels of IL-18 in BAL fluid compared with control disease and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of IFN-gamma and IL-18 were observed from BD-BAL fluid cells both spontaneously and after LPS stimulation, at higher levels compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">silicosis</z:e> patients and healthy subjects (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously only BD BAL cells expressed IL-18 mRNA and IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after LPS stimulation IL-18 mRNA and IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were observed in BD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">silicosis</z:e> and HC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recombinant IL-18 induced IFN-gamma production in BD- BAL fluid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administration of IL-18 induced greater IFN-gamma production in BD-BAL fluid cells, than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BAL fluid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that IL-18 up-regulation is a feature of BD and suggest that IL-18 and IFN-gamma may contribute to the local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
