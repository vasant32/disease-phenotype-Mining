<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who had a total of 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent helical CT before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both initial and follow-up CT scans were evaluated for location, number, and size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pulmonary parenchyma changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five (76%) of the 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> completely disappeared during the 3-42 months of treatment (mean, 21 months), and the remaining 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (24%) became smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both disappearance and regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were preceded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 15 initially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (33%), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> increased in size during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> regressed and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one initially nonthrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (67%) first became thrombosed during treatment; later, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> regressed and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> decreased in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perianeurysmal consolidation and air-space nodules detected in seven patients disappeared in the early stages of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mosaic attenuation areas were seen in eight patients and disappeared in seven (88%) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>Pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may become smaller or disappear with medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mural thrombotic changes may be observed during the regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Helical CT is helpful in the diagnosis and follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
