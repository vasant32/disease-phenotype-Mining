<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma C9 levels were also followed sequentially in four patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease to show fluctuation during disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for plasma C9 was 90 mg/l, 2 standard deviations above the known mean value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly raised levels were found in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (119.7 +/- 28.3), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (177.9 +/- 26.2) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (116.1 +/- 23.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease the raised C9 levels normalized during disease quiescence suggesting that C9 is a good monitor of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRP and ESR values were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> C9 was more consistently elevated in active disease than CRP or ESR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As there was no association between these measures on mathematical analysis it was concluded that plasma C9 is a better indicator of disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
