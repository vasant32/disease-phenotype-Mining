<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this prospective study was to investigate whether there is any relationship among the oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels in patients with BD and its subtypes: complete <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (CBD) and incomplete <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (ICBD), with or without ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were evaluated for NO and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with BD were divided into two subgroups: those with and without ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with CBD and 4 patients with ICBD had ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum NO level was determined by Griess reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in serum were analyzed with spectrophotometric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels but decreased GSH-Px activities in plasma were observed in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes, as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concerning the presence of ocular disease and the subtype (CBD or ICBD) compared with each other, there were no significant differences in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> or NO serum levels and SOD or GSH-Px enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum NO levels and SOD enzyme activities were not significantly changed in patients with BD and its subtypes; however, a remarkable decrease of GSH-Px enzyme activity and increase of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were found </plain></SENT>
