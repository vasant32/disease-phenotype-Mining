<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemokines are required for the extravasation of leukocytes to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine which chemokines are augmented in the serum of patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular sarcoidosis</z:e>, 28 with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular sarcoidosis</z:e>, 16 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease, 17 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease</z:e>, and 18 healthy subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were simultaneously measured by cytometric bead array using flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels in the patients with diagnosed or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular sarcoidosis</z:e> were compared with respect to ocular disease activity, the presence of bilateral hilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (BHL), and laboratory data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of both CXCL9 and CXCL10 were markedly elevated in the patients with diagnosed or suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular sarcoidosis</z:e> compared with patients with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although CCL2 and CXCL8 were detected in the serum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, the levels were extremely low with no significant differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevation of serum CXCL9 and CXCL10 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular sarcoidosis</z:e> correlated significantly with ocular disease activity and ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) levels and was unrelated to the presence of BHL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count, serum IgG, or serum lysozyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that serum levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were elevated markedly in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular sarcoidosis</z:e> and correlated with ocular disease activity and ACE level </plain></SENT>
