<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five unrelated Sardinian patients with BD, diagnosed according to the ISG criteria, 45 HLA-B*51 positive and 185 unselected healthy controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were typed for HLA class I and class II alleles and genotyped for microsatellites (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1264457 HLA-E; rs2281820 motilin; rs1799724 at -857, rs361525 at -238 TNF-alpha) spanning the HLA region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HLA-B*5101 was confirmed as conferring susceptibility to BD (pc=0.0042; OR=4.4; 95% CI=2.0 to 9.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that in Sardinia this allele was found more frequently within a haplotype (HLA-A2; -Cw2; -B*5101; -DRB1*11; -DQA1*05; - DQB1*03) that reached its highest frequency in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed the existence of an additional B*51 haplotype (HLA-A2; -Cw2; -B*5101; -DRB1*04; -DQA1*03; -DQB1*03) not associated with susceptibility to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Sardinia, the BD-associated HLA-B*5101 allele is inherited as part of two distinctive haplotypes differently distributed in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings can be interpreted as suggestive of the presence of additional genes within the MHC region conferring susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that an environmental pressure could have contributed to the preservation of the BD-associated HLA haplotype in Sardinia is also discussed </plain></SENT>
