<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 32-year-old man developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right-sided sore throat, a thick voice and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>13 years previously he had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, 12 and 10 year ago <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission he had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, bulging of the gums and swelling of the paratracheal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had been on anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> since the leg vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Computed tomography demonstrated a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>9 months later a right radial artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occurred, which was treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An arterial cannula had previously been placed at this site for pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2 months later a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right femoral artery was diagnosed: it had previously been used for an intravascular intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As embolization to the popliteal artery occurred after sonographically controlled compression had failed and reduction of anticoagulation treatment, this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, too, was treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Because of the tendency to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation after arterial puncture and the history of venous thromboses the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome was considered, confirmed by subsequently elucidated history of recurrent oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no other manifestations of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive treatment was instituted after another two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrences were noted in the right common femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome may be made more difficult if its manifestation is primarily vascular with minimal mucocutaneous involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in a young person </plain></SENT>
