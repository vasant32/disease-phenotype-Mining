<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma ET-1 concentrations were found to be significantly increased in patients with BD (121.15 +/- 11.6 fmol/dl) compared with the healthy subjects (89.37 +/- 8.03 fmol/dl p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The elevation of ET-1 did not correlate with the disease duration, gender, ocular or articular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether the elevated ET-1 level is a direct result of its increased synthesis from injured vascular endothelial cells or whether its presence in high concentrations may be responsible, together with other factors for both vascular and articular complications in patients with BD is uncertain </plain></SENT>
