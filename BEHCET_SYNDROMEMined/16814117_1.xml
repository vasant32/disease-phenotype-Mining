<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adamantiades-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (ABD) is a multisystemic inflammatory/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> involving both microcirculation and macrocirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness index and aortic augmentation index (AI) are indices for the estimation of arterial stiffness and pressure wave reflections, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs used in ABD on these indices is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we examined 74 subjects with ABD (aged 40.1 +/- 12.5 years, 24 men) and 24 control subjects by using the noninvasive technique of radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis for assessment of aortic AI by application of transfer functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was used for assessment of aortic stiffness index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Classic cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, left ventricular and endothelial function of the brachial artery, as well as intima-media thickness of carotid artery, were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi> were the only drug having a negative and independent effect on aortic AI, but not on aortic stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> had lower aortic AI and central systolic blood pressure (BP), but not aortic stiffness and peripheral systolic BP, when compared to those without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (21+/-14% v 12+/-14%, P &lt; .050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medication, traditional CV risk factors, and functional or structural CV parameters were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparable among the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AI was similar between the control group and patients with ABD taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AI, but not aortic stiffness, is lower in patients with ABD taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> compared to patients not taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and similar to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results imply a role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or immunomodulatory mechanisms in the regulation of pressure wave reflections </plain></SENT>
