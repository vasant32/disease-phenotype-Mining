<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rIFN-alpha-2a was applied subcutaneously at a dose of 9 x 10(6) IU three times a week for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients showed a significant reduction in the number, severity, duration and frequency of their mucocutaneous lesions during the treatment compared with the pretreatment phase, whereas in two patients a complete remission and in three patients a partial remission was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients, one with complete and one with partial remission, recurrence of the cutaneous symptoms occurred shortly after discontinuation of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Renewed administration of rIFN-alpha-2a again led to remission of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another patient with initial partial remission followed by exacerbation, interferon alpha antibodies were detected and the patient responded again when 15 x 10(6) IU rIFN-alpha-2a was administered three times a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients did not show any change in the characteristics of their lesions, while two patients experienced progression of their disease during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Side-effects were generally mild and well tolerated, but the treatment was discontinued earlier than planned in one patient because of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonus</z:mp> and diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the classical treatments are generally unsatisfactory, the results of the present study justify the administration of systemic rIFN-alpha-2a in the treatment of the mucocutaneous type of Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
