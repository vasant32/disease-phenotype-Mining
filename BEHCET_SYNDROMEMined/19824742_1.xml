<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, inflammatory, multisystemic vasculitic disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence is seen in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific diagnostic tools are yet to be discovered; thus, the diagnosis relies on physicians being acquainted with the symptoms and signs of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of BD and to emphasize the typical clinical and laboratory characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the BD patients attending the Ankara Numune Education and Research Hospital throughout the years 2001-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of BD was made according to the International Study Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 213 patients were evaluated with respect to family history, clinical features, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antistreptolysin O, and ferritin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When assessing disease activity, the active clinical manifestations on the day of the examination were taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlations were analyzed between sex and age distribution, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, disease duration, and family history; and between family history and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>, clinical manifestations, and laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlations were also evaluated between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity and clinical manifestations, and laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlations between activity scores and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, duration, sex, family history, and laboratory data were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The female : male ratio was 1.04, and the mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Family history did not affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> or disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Men presented with more active disease, and there was a weak but positive correlation between disease activity and CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between duration and age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical presentations were oral aphthous lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Men more commonly presented with papulopustular lesions, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity, and vascular, eye, and renal involvement, and women presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> more commonly than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Vascular lesions, ESR, and CRP showed significant relationships with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Eye involvement was not affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We believe our results indicate that the pathogenesis of BD is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Hormonal factors seem to be of some influence, while genetic background and environmental factors seem to be the major contributors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> seem to be among the triggering environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Predisposing genes may affect the influence of environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Prevalence studies should be carried out periodically in those countries with a high prevalence of BD to keep up with the changing dynamics of the disease, which may also shed light on the as-yet unknown pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
