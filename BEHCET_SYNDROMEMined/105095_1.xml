<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that owing to the diverse and frequently contrasting modes of action of these agents, this may well be an unproductive task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is one exception to this conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since levamisole in small concentrations given intermittently appears to act as an immunopotentiator, and in large, prolonged dosages possible as an immunosuppressor, future "diagnostic-therapeutic" trials could examine this dichotomy to determine whether aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome are infectious or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_189'>hypersensitivity diseases</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
