<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nonrandomized retrospective case-series study analyzed data from 22 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, from a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> Service, São Paulo, Brazil (period 1978-2007), under systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, for at least 6 months with a minimum one-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drug efficacy was measured by reduction in relapse rate and reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients (10M/12F) mean age was 29 (range 10-43) years-old at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of followup was 11 (range 1-29) years-old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi> (2-6 mg/day) was used in 13 patients and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (3-5 mg/kg/day) in 9 patients at initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drugs were switched because of no effectiveness or side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi> was effective in 78.5% (11/14) and induced disease remission in 43% (6/14) of patients, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A was effective in 57% (8/14) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A were discontinued due to side effects in 21% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>) and in 57% of patients (nephrotoxicity, 36% and gastrointestinal complications, 21%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No case of late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>36% (16/44) of eyes had final visual acuity &lt; or =0.1, among which 69% (11/16) had already this visual acuity at the first visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study reiterates previous data that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> can induce long-term remission of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> is effective but side effects limit its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi> therapy may still be a reasonable option in patients with intractable, sight-threatening <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
