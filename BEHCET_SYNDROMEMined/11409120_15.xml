<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 genes may contribute to the inflammatory events responsible for the vessel damage in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined potential associations of ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms with BD susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case patients were 74 consecutive Italian patients with BD who were followed at the Bologna, Ferrara, Milano, Potenza, Prato, Reggio Emilia, and Trento rheumatology, ophthalmology, and neurology units over a 3 year period (1997-99) who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD; 228 healthy Italian blood donors from the same geographic areas were selected as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BD patients and controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide techniques for ICAM-1 polymorphisms at codon 241 (exon 4) and codon 469 (exon 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of R241 was significantly higher in BD patients than in controls (20.3% vs 5.7%; p = 0.001, pcorr = 0.002, OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.9-9.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of E/K 469 genotype was similar in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing patients with different clinical features, we found only a trend to higher frequency of R241 in patients with articular manifestations (21.4% vs 12.5%; p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings show that G/R 241 polymorphism of ICAM-1 is associated with BD susceptibility </plain></SENT>
