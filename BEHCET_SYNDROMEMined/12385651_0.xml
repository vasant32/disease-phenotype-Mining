<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) were enrrolled for being studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), SPECT and psychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRI findings were abnormal in 52,9% of patients with neurological involvement and 23.1% without it (p &lt; 0.1), whereas SPECT findings were abnormal in 82.3% and 61.5%, respectively (no significant difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference between MRI and SPECT findings was significant (p &lt; 0.02 for the complete group; p &lt; 0.05 for patients without neurological symptoms; p &lt; 0.08 for patients with them) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 42.6 months, and no patient without neurological involvement or those only with neurological symptoms that are difficult to interprete developed definite neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of cognitive tests were not significantly different among patients with or without neurological involvement, neither among patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scale 2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) of the personality test was more frequent in patients with definite neurological involvement (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SPECT seems more sensible and less specific than MRI for diagnostic of NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although SPECT findings were frequently abnormal in patients with BD without neurological involvement or with neurological symptoms hard to interpret, no patient from this group developed a NB flare after a long follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A characteristic personality was found for patients with BD </plain></SENT>
