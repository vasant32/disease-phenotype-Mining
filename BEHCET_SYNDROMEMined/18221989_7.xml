<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We had the impression and preliminary evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was not much increased in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the presence of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in a sizeable group of patients with BS both with major organ involvement and mucocutaneous disease along with diseased and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 239 (162 M/ 77 F; mean age: 40.7+/-7.0) patients with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two (32 M/ 40 F) had only mucocutaneous and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint disease</z:e> and 167 (130 M/ 37 F) had major organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also 100 (24 M/ 76 F; mean age: 44.7+/-7.1) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), 74 (58 M/ 16 F; mean age: 39.4+/-7.0) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS) and 156 (83 M/ 73 F; mean age: 39.2+/-6.6) healthy controls (HC) were studied as the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used B-mode USG to assess the frequency of plaques and intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) in the carotid and femoral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Traditional atherosclerotic risk factors were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men and women were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of plaques and the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in the carotid and femoral arteries were similar between patients with BS, AS and HC and also between the 2 subgroups of BS, among both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only men with RA were found to have significantly increased frequency of carotid artery plaques after adjustment for atherosclerotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is not a prominent feature of BS, even among those patients with major organ involvement </plain></SENT>
