<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical features, pathologic findings, postoperative results and the effects of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the postoperative course of the 9 BD patients who underwent a total of 17 aortic valve replacement procedures with prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological examination of the aortic valve commonly revealed diffuse myxoid degeneration (75 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 17 valve replacement surgeries, 13 surgeries resulted in complications, such as detachment of the prosthetic valve with perivalvular leakage and dehiscence of the sternotomy wound, within an average of 5 months (range from 1 month to 14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of prosthetic valve detachment was 76 percent (13 of 17 surgeries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the 9 patients (44 percent) who underwent aortic valve replacement procedures died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> associated with the detachment of the prosthetic valve, and perivalvular leakage within an average of 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> associated with dehiscence of the prosthetic valve developed in 11 of 12 surgical cases (92 percent) with a mechanical valve and 2 of 5 surgical cases (40 percent) with tissue valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 15 surgeries (87 percent) which were not given postoperative immunosuppressive therapy developed complications, while none of 2 surgeries that used postoperative immunosuppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/day) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (100 mg/day) had these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rates of prosthetic valve detachment in BD involving aortic valve were higher than those of other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve involvement was also one of the poor prognostic factors in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intensive postoperative immunosuppressive therapy and surgical methods may be important factors for postoperative results </plain></SENT>
