<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some patients, ocular involvement can lead to severe vision impairment despite immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since high levels of circulating TNF-alpha have been found both in peripheral blood and aqueous humor of patients with active BD, we evaluated the efficacy of anti-TNF-alpha therapy in seven patients with severe ocular involvement resistant to previous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with sight-threatening relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> refractory to immunosuppressive regimens received intravenously infliximab, at a dose of 3-5 mg/kg, on week 0-2-4 and then every 6-8 weeks, in combination with low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed in terms of number and severity of relapses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, visual acuity, and reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up period of 23 months, the total number of relapses dropped to 6, compared to the 21 observed in an equivalent period of time before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity improved in 4 eyes, while it remained stable in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therapy with infliximab considerably reduced the required daily dose of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our experience infliximab proved to be safe and effective in controlling both the number and intensity of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> and the extraocular manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also allowed a reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive drugs required to control the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, ocular and systemic manifestations tended to recur after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug withdrawal</z:e> or when the interval between infliximab courses was longer than 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, infliximab administration is costly and requires hospital admission </plain></SENT>
