<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (BD) is a multisystem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of unknown origin in which neurologic involvement has been reported in the range of 5% to 10% in large series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reports on clinical and radiologic aspects of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>) are in general limited in number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patterns in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> who had neural parenchymal involvement and to correlate our findings with possible vascular pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of 65 patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> and neural parenchymal involvement were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of patients who had serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies, we evaluated the anatomic-radiologic location and distribution of the lesions and whether they corresponded to any vascular territory, and studied their extension, enhancement patterns, and temporal course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common imaging finding in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> patients who had neural parenchymal involvement was a mesodiencephalic junction lesion with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> extending along certain long tracts in the brain stem and diencephalon in 46% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The next most common location of involvement was the pontobulbar region, seen in 40% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three primary cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100561'>spinal cord lesions</z:hpo> and one case of isolated optic nerve involvement were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The parenchymal distribution of lesions in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> appears to support the hypothesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011944'>small-vessel vasculitis</z:hpo>; mainly, venular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anatomic distribution of intraaxial veins of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> explains the predominant involvement of the brain stem structures observed in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This pattern of lesion distribution might help to differentiate <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> as well as from the inflammatory-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating diseases</z:e> of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, such as multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
