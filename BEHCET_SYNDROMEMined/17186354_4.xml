<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) showed a projecting saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> below the right renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We placed a stent-graft just below the right renal artery, successfully excluding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His C-reactive protein level and white blood cell count remained elevated after stent-grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About 5 months later, he was readmitted with recurrent back and lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and CT showed progression of the AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we performed straight grafting using a woven Dacron graft just below the right renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had an uneventful postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss the controversial issue of treating AAA in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, focusing on the indications and timing of surgery </plain></SENT>
