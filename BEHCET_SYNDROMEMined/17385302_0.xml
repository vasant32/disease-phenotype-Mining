<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we need a useful non-invasive method to detect articular involvement early in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with nonspecific complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of 99mTc-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29262">diphosphonate</z:chebi> (Tc-99m-MDP) bone scintigraphy in the detection of the articular involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone scintigraphy with Tc-99m-MDP was performed in 32 (17 male, 15 female) consecutive patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sacroiliac (SI) joints with SI index higher than 1.34 were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sacroiliitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although joint complaints were present in only 8 (25%) patients, we detected joint involvement by scintigraphy in 27/32 (84.4%) <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients mostly affecting the knees (62.5%), ankles (59.4%), SI joints (25%), wrists (21.9%), shoulders (18.7%), elbows (12.5%) and hips (3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The articular involvement was monoarticular in four cases (12.5%) and was oligoarticular in the remaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between joint involvement and age, gender, disease duration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242510" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug usage</z:e> or other clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that our patients were clinically asymptomatic and had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pelvis radiography, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sacroiliitis</z:e> was found in 8 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone scintigraphy is sensitive in the diagnosis of joint involvement allowing earlier diagnosis and showing the presence of articular involvement, especially in SI joints </plain></SENT>
