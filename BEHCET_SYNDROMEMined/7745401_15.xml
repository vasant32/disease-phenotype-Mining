<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of CSF and serum analysis from a total of 43 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and 12 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with neurological involvement found local synthesis of oligoclonal IgG using isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting in 51%, 25%, and 8% respectively at some stage in their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood-brain barrier breakdown, when assessed with an albumin ratio found 47% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, 30% of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and 42% of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease exhibiting abnormal barrier function at some time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial CSF analysis showed that clinical relapses were associated with worsening barrier function and in some patients the development of local oligoclonal IgG synthesis; conversely steroid treatment led to a statistically significant improvement in barrier function, and in two patients a loss of oligoclonal IgG bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of patients had MRI abnormalities than oligoclonal IgG or blood-brain barrier breakdown, MRI being abnormal in 16 of 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, three of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and seven of nine patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, although this may have been due to temporal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, locally synthesised oligoclonal IgG cannot distinguish between diseases, but the loss of bands seen in two patients contrasts with what is seen in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, and thus may be a useful diagnostic clue </plain></SENT>
