<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">Heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (HS) is the most abundant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> in the endothelial cells, and anti-HS antibodies have been reported in subjects with vascular damage, due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>/vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to measure serum anti-HS antibodies in patients with BD and to determine whether their presence correlates with disease activity or clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with BD (21 men, 11 women) (median age 36.81+/-12.0 years) were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 13 had clinically active disease at the time of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean disease duration was 7.31+/- 8.2 years (median 6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-HS antibodies were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As controls, sera from 40 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects, and 78 age-matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-HS IgM antibody titres were significantly higher in BD patients compared to healthy subjects (p=0.016) and SLE controls (p=0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences in anti-HS IgG antibody titres were observed among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using categorical data, increased titres of IgM anti-HS antibodies were significantly more frequent in patients with BD vs patients with SLE (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of the antibodies, of either isotype, did not correlate with disease duration, disease activity or clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BD patients have increased IgM anti-HS antibody titres compared to healthy and SLE controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These antibodies did not correlate with disease activity or discrete clinical features, but might be relevant for pathogenic mechanisms of the disease </plain></SENT>
