<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and their inter-relationships considering the disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (11 male and 7 female) and 20 age-matched healthy subjects (10 male and 10 female) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> profile including total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), apoAI and apoB, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants including polymorphonuclear (PMN) elastase, PMN leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and complements (C3, C4) were evaluated in patients in active and inactive periods of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance (TBARS) were assessed as an indicator of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was found to he increased in the active period compared to the inactive period of the disease and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation showed correlations of various degrees with atherogenic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters in both periods of the followed-up patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the active period may be much more susceptible to atherogenic events than those in the inactive period of the disease and control subjects </plain></SENT>
