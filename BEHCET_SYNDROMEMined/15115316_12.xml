<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the G vs. A variation at the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 promoter -2518 position among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Koreans and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> patients, and to investigate possible association of this polymorphism with disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The allele type of -2518 polymorphism was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism of Pvu II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in serum and culture supernatent was measured by sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average serum level of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> patients was 2.37 times higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 concentration was higher in G-allele carriers than in AA homozygotes, and symptoms accompanying graver cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004386'>gastrointestinal inflammation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, were more frequent in patients with the G-allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of G-allele in patient group was not higher than that in healthy Koreans, probably due to the dominance of G-allele in general Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When stimulated in vitro with IL-1beta and LPS, the mononuclear cells from patients carrying the G-allele showed a steeper increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 production than the boost observed in AA homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the allele frequency of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 promoter -2518 polymorphism is not likely to be the reason for the elevated serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 level in Korean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, it is possible that proinflammatory factors induced in patients' serum cause stronger activation of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 expression from the G-type promoter, as well as increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcer</z:hpo>, among carriers of the G-allele </plain></SENT>
