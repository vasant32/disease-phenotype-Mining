<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was undertaken on 58 patients with BD (BD group), 56 patients with SpA (SpA group), and 3 patients who concurrently satisfied the criteria for BD and SpA (BDSpA group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical parameters and known susceptible HLA antigens were compared between BD group and SpA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3 patients in BDSpA group were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of definitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sacroiliitis</z:e> (SI) in BD group and SpA group was 46.4% and 5.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, none had a definitive SI in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>Enthesitis</z:hpo> was observed in 3.4% of BD group and in 50% of SpA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patterns of eye involvement were different between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-B27 was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 49 patients of BD group, whereas it was positive in 67.9% of SpA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of HLA-B51 was 51.7% in BD group, and that in SpA group was 21.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient in BDSpA group was considered to have concurrent BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another patient was closer to AS, and the third to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusively, it seems that BD could not be classified into the SpA complex </plain></SENT>
