<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> sign was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e>, both in our patients and in those of other published series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eye involvement, joint involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> followed in frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a 10-year follow-up differences were observed between men and women, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> being more frequent in females compared to males and with an overall more severe course in males </plain></SENT>
