<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of circulating gamma delta+ T cells among total lymphocytes or among total T cells was significantly increased in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase in circulating gamma delta+ T cells was related to mucocutaneous lesions, but not the HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among gamma delta+ T cells, the number of CD8+ or CD56+ subset was significantly increased in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significant increases of peripheral blood NK cells (CD16+CD56+CD3-, CD2+CD3-, CD8dim+CD3-) and CD56+ T lymphocytes were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that increased circulating gamma delta+ T cells and NK cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
