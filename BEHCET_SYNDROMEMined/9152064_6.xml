<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the levels of interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra) in the blood serum of patients with idiopathic bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pars planitis</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five milliliters of blood was with-drawn from the cubital vein of 91 patients (58 with the ocular type and five with the combined type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease; 28 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pars planitis</z:e>) and 36 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum was separated from these samples and stored at -70 C until assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> levels were determined by human IL-1ra enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients not receiving any systemic medication, one serum sample was obtained before initiating treatment and another when the patients had been under full medical treatment for 6 weeks or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment mean +/- SD serum IL-1ra levels were 320 +/- 32 pg/ml for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pars planitis</z:e>, 380 +/- 54 pg/ml for patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, and 271 +/- 29 pg/ml for the control subjects (no statistical significance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During treatment, a mean serum level of 352 +/- 37 pg/ml was observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pars planitis</z:e> (not significantly different from control subjects) and 538 +/- 79 pg/ml in patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (P = .0116 compared with control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The greatest increase in IL-1ra levels was observed in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who received a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because IL-1ra is one of the natural immunomodulating molecules, the significant increase of serum IL-1ra levels, especially after combined treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, could indicate that the therapeutic effects of this regimen may be mediated through its effects on this molecule </plain></SENT>
