<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with incident BD diagnosed over a 17-year period (from January 1, 1988 to December 31, 2004) living in the Reggio Emilia area were identified through the following sources: physicians at Reggio Emilia Hospital, medical practitioners, and community-based specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients registered in a centralized index and in the Reggio Emilia district database for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up from the time of diagnosis until either their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or April 1, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients (9 men and 9 women) had complete BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD age at diagnosis was 33 +/- 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of BD was 0.24 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BD on January 1, 2005 was 3.8 per 100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patients died during the followup period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> during the disease course, 22.2% had no oral lesions at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Eye disease</z:e> occurred in 55.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ocular disease was more common in men and appeared at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or within the first few years of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (median 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient had loss of useful vision in at least 1 eye at the end of followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected patients, visual acuity improved once treatment was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This population-based study is the first to report the prevalence and incidence of BD in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In Italian patients, BD is nonfatal and the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> is good </plain></SENT>
