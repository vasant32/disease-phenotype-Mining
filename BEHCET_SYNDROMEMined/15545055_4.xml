<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Peripheral blood CD8+ T cells expressing interferon gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4), and lacking CD28 molecules, were responsible for the dynamic interplay between peripheral blood and inflammatory sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of the current study was to define in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), CD8+ T-cell subsets using CD28 and CD11b monoclonal antibodies, and the characterization of the Tc1/Tc2 ratio and perforin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Flow cytometry was used for intracytoplasmic cytokines and perforin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effector cells were investigated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of CD8+ T cells to human microvascular endothelial cells and by chemotaxis using beta-chemokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interferon-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells in active and remission BD patients were increased, which induce a significant increase of the Tc1:Tc2 ratio in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD8(+)CD28(-)CD11b+ T cells were found to be more expanded in BD patients than in age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD11b molecules in active BD allowed to CD8(+)CD28+/CD8(+)CD28- subsets to adhere to human microvascular endothelial cells, with more efficiency in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using MIP-1alpha, we observed that the migratory process of CD28(-)CD11b(+) is more important in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD28(-)CD11b+ exhibited an increased perforin expression in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together these results suggest the presence of immune activation, probably in response to a profound <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> affecting BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The physiopathological significance of these results were toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and/or infectious process </plain></SENT>
