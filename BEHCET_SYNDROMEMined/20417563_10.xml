<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the intermediate-term safety and effectiveness of interferon alpha-2a (IFNalpha2a) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (BU) refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Open, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, interventional, prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-three patients (106 eyes) with active, vision-threatening BU who failed to respond to conventional treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: In 53 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was suppressed with effective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> dosage (1-2 mg/kg/day, tapered to 10 mg within 4-6 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with IFNalpha2a 4.5 million international units (MIU) 3 times per week for the first 3 months followed by IFNalpha2a 3 MIU 3 times per week for the next 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Observation or other treatment methods were performed according to the decision tree developed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Remission and complete response (primary outcome measures), frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks, visual acuity (VA), and adverse effects (secondary outcome measures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 2 years of follow-up (median 65 months, range 12-130 months), compliance with the therapy was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of 1-year follow-up, treatment response was obtained in 45 of 53 patients (84.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean attack rate of 3.6+/-1.1 per year (range, 2-8) decreased to 0.56+/-0.75 (range, 0-4) per year (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved (&gt; or = 0.2 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units from initial VA) in 30 eyes (28.3%) and worsened in 12 eyes (11.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients (9.4%) did not respond to the initial treatment, and 3 patients (5.6%) developed severe adverse effects, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, and extreme tiredness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (28.3%) were off treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the medications and disease free for 28+/-13.1 months (range, 12-50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IFNalpha2a may be a valuable treatment option in BU that is refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The possible role of IFNalpha2a as a first-line agent in BU should be validated in randomized controlled clinical trials against newly described biologic agents </plain></SENT>
