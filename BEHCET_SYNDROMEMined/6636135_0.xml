<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the level of circulating immune complexes and that of complement are increased in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The solubilization capacity appeared to increase, paralleling the rise of serum complement levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased capacity to solubilize immune complexes may be attributed to complement that is increased in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the capacity to solubilize complexes and the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is discussed </plain></SENT>
