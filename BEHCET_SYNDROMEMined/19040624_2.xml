<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aims were to evaluate the prevalence of FSD in premenopausal BD patients and to compare hormonal and psychiatric conditions to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 71 married women with BD and 63 healthy married women between 18 and 44 years old were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After evaluating detailed history and physical examination, serum steroid hormone levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> in physical examination and any medical treatment were recorded in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were asked to complete the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) for sexual status and Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI) for psychiatric assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: FSFI and BDI scores and serum sex steroid hormone levels were measured in women with BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean BDI score of patients was significantly greater than that for controls (P = 0.001), and there was a statistically significant difference between BDI scores (Pearson chi2 = 19.109, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FSD was found in 34 patients with BD (47.9%) and in 11 controls (17.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (Pearson chi2 = 13.855, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problem</z:e> in the patients with BD was diminished arousal (n = 49, 69.0%), diminished desire was found in 32 patients (45.1%) and lubrication problems in 36 patients (50.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant negative correlation between BDI and FSFI score in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, there was no relationship between FSFI and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FSD is more common in BD patients than in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that depressive mood according to the BDI scale correlates with the sexual status of BD patients, and this may be because of the depressive effect of BD as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
