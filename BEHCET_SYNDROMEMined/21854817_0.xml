<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with BD were individually matched to 50 control subjects on the basis of age, gender and traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or cerebrovascular disease were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with arterial involvement were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also measured serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels, and HOMA-IR values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used B-mode ultrasonography to assess the cIMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: cIMT in the BD group was significantly higher than in the control group (0.658 ± 0.112 mm vs. 0.581 ± 0.087 mm, respectively, p &lt;10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of plaques in the carotid arteries was similar between study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, the cIMT of BD patients was correlated with age (r = 0.510, p &lt;10(-3)), male gender (p = 0.032), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance (r = -0.421, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was inversely correlated with HOMA-IR values and serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>cIMT values were independent of disease manifestations, disease duration, or corticoid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, only male gender and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance remained significantly associated with cIMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate morphologic evidence of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increased arterial wall thickness was not associated with the disease duration, clinical manifestations and immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
