<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the visual prognosis of patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and to determine factors predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventy-five eyes of 107 patients diagnosed with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> (best-corrected visual acuity, worse than 20/40) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> (best-corrected visual acuity, 20/200 or worse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presenting visual acuity was worse than 20/40 in 50% of eyes and 20/200 or worse in 21% of eyes; approximately one third of this was reversible with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of irreversible severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemic maculopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 10 years, there was a 39% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and a 24% risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, the latter figure being reduced to 13% if patients with irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> at presentation were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After controlling for potentially confounding variables, male sex, unilateral disease, and left eye involvement <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were statistically significant risk factors for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> at 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who were treated with biologic agents were less likely to have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in either eye at both 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease still have irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the visual prognosis is otherwise improved, with a 10-year risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> of 13% in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of biologic agents is associated with a lower risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> at 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
