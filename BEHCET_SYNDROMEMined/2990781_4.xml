<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin class of this antibody activity called 'the anti-basal aspect of syncytiotrophoblast (anti-BAST)', was exclusively IgM and detected in the sera of both female and male patients with SLE and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, but rarely in the sera of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent absorption and blocking test revealed that anti-BAST specifically reacted with human placenta and cross-reacted with subhuman primate type C <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> retrovirus SSV/SSAV (simian <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> virus/simian <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> associated virus), but did not cross-react with ATLV (adult T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> virus) and BaEV (baboon endogenous retrovirus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the presence of a new antigen-antibody system for another human type C retrovirus related antigens(s) and a participation of retrovirus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
