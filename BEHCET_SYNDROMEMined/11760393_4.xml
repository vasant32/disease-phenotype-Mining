<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various functions of neutrophils are studied to clarify this role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The oxidative burst and phagocytic functions of neutrophils and surface molecules associated with neutrophil activation (CD10, CD14 and CD16) were investigated in BD patients by flow cytometric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and healthy controls were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the oxidative burst experiments, after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> stimulation, stimulation index was found to be significantly decreased in patients both with BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> compared to healthy controls and inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathies</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phagocytosis of labelled E. coli particles in patients with BD was not different from that of the healthy controls, while it was decreased in diseased controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surface density of neutral endopeptidase (CD10) and the mean percentage of LPS receptor (CD14) was found to be significantly higher in both BD patients and diseased controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of CD16 expression was only low in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001), whereas CD16 intensity on cells was found to be lower in patients with BD as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate the presence of in vivo pre-activated neutrophils in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar activation was also a feature of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
