<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome have an increased risk of arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011869'>abnormal platelet function</z:hpo> has been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet function was studied in nine patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and in nine age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation in response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> was measured, and the threshold concentration required to produce irreversible aggregation determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of platelets to the inhibitory effect of prostacyclin was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma levels of the platelet-specific proteins, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4, and stimulated platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> production, were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelets from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aggregation in response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, irrespective of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin was, however, decreased compared with controls--with a mean prostacyclin ID50 of 5.5 +/- 1.3 ng ml-1 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and 1.9 +/- 0.3 ng ml-1, respectively (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This reduction in platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin was greatest in patients with the most active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome may be associated with altered platelet function, and this may have important consequences with regard to the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with this condition </plain></SENT>
