<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significantly impaired uptake of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> by CD4 cells was found in BD, as compared with healthy HSV1 sero-positive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impaired cellular response appeared to be specific to HSV1, as neither cytomegalovirus nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella-zoster</z:e> virus showed depressed CD4 cell responses in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar impairment of CD4 cell responses to HSV1 was found in patients with recurrent herpetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, known to be caused by latent HSV1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake by CD4 cells stimulated with HSV1 was enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD8 cells showed generally rather a low uptake of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, nevertheless, the values in BD and recurrent herpetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were again lower than those in sero-positive controls or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with the hypothesis that HSV1 might be involved in the immunopathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
