<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human β-defensin 2 is an inducible antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, the level of which can be influenced by copy number <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> of the DEFB4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between copy number variation (CNV) of DEFB4 and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven patients with BD and 197 healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After measuring CN of DEFB4 with a paralogue ratio test, the CNV was compared between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CNV was also analysed in comparison with the clinical manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CN of DEFB4 was unimodally distributed among the study subjects with mean CN of 4.57 and standard deviation of 1.28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BD samples had numerically lower CN than controls, but the difference was not statistically significant (4.49 ± 1.21 vs. 4.65 ± 1.36, p=0.245) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding the relationship between CN of DEFB4 and clinical manifestations, there was no difference of CNV depending on the clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant difference in CNV of DEFB4 between patients with BD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that CNV of DEFB4 may not contribute to the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
