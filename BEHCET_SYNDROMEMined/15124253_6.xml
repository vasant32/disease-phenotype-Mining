<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Current outcome measures for patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) are impairment-focused and do not necessarily take account of the wider impact of the condition on the individual's lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to develop a disease-specific measure of quality of life (QoL) for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The content of the BD-QoL was derived from qualitative interviews with patients using a "needs-based" approach to identify items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A postal survey was used to test the scaling properties, reliability, internal consistency, and validity of the new questionnaire using Rasch analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second postal survey was used to assess test-retest reliability and internal consistency and to provide further evidence of the validity of the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Main themes emerging from the qualitative interviews included relationships, emotions, limitations in day to day activities, and self-image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these themes 71 statements were chosen as potential items for the BD-QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After analysis, 30 items of the BD-QoL emerged free of item bias for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fit to the Rasch model was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second postal survey test-retest reliability of the 30 item BD-QoL was 0.84 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The BD-QoL provides the clinician with a simple, reliable, and valid tool for assessing the influence of interventions for BD and for evaluating models of service delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is well accepted by patients, and has excellent scaling and psychometric properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The BD-QoL complements information obtained through BD-specific disease activity scales </plain></SENT>
