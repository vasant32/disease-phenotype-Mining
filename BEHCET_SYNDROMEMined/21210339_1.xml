<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (NBD) is not well described in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to analyse the clinical patterns of paediatric NBD and to describe their repercussions on children's schooling </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases, neurological symptoms were the initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In other cases, NBD occurred within a mean time of 10 months after BD was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous thromboses were frequent (5/12) as compared to recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> (2/12), rhombencephalitis (2/12), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e> (1/12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (1/12) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disturbances</z:hpo> (1/12) </plain></SENT>
