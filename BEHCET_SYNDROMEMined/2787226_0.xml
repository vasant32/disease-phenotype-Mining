<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings provide further evidence of an immunoregulatory disturbance in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and indicate that synovial fluid, may be an important site where this derangement occurs in the active stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
