<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The reduced expression of molecules limiting excessive immune responses has been considered a pathogenic mechanism associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To understand the implications of costimulatory molecules in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), the expression of CTLA-4 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 on T-cell subsets and of their ligands CD80, CD86 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 11 patients with active BD, eight patients with inactive BD, eight patients with recurrent aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and 10 healthy volunteers as healthy controls (HC) were stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of costimulatory molecules was then analysed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soluble CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the transcript level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1 was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1 expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of patients with BD was evaluated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the HC group, reduced expression of CTLA-4 in CD4+ T cells after stimulation was observed in the active BD group, with no difference in the production of sCTLA-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD86 expression, in the resting APCs, was reduced in the active BD group compared with the HC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1 expression in the APCs was decreased in the active BD group with or without stimulation of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concordantly, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1 in PBMC, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1 expression in the cutaneous lesions, were low in the active BD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that altered expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-L1, CTLA-4 and CD86 may be involved in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
