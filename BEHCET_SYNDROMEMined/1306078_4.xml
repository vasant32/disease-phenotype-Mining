<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A variety of methods were used to establish objective diagnostic criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We intended to introduce another method, using radionuclide (Tc-99m <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29262">diphosphonate</z:chebi>) scintigraphy, which is more objective, simple and economical than the past methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The finger blood flow with radionuclide scintigraphy was evaluated in 10 patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's syndrome</z:e>, 12 patients of connective disease without Raynaud's symptoms, and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After immersing one hand in ice water (4 degrees C) for 30 seconds, the hand was exposed to 22 degrees C room air for 15 minutes, and then the patients received the intravenous (IV) bolus of 20 microCi of Tc-99m <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29262">diphosphonate</z:chebi> (MDP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the same time, scintigraphic image of both hands started with the region of interest, including the second, third, fourth and fifth fingers distal to the metacarpophalangeal (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer recording of the counts in the region of interest every 2 seconds for 310 seconds was started on IV bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 310 seconds cumulative digital blood flow ratio of cold exposed hand to room air exposed hand was significantly lower in Raynaud's group (p &lt; 0.001), and the ratio of initial slope of activity curve was also lower in the Raynaud's group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 patients showing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's syndrome</z:e>, 4 patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> and 1 patient of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> showed no improvement of finger blood flow in the cold exposed hand after 2 weeks of pharmacological therapy, but 1 patient of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e>, 1 patient of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> and 1 patient of SLE showed much improved finger blood flow after combined administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> and antiplatelet drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of finger blood flow with 99mTc-MDP could be considered to be one of the simple, economical and new methods that can be used in the follow-up, objective assessment of therapeutic effect, and giving an aid in the study of the pathophysiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
