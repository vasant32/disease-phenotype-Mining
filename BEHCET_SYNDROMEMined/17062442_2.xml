<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential susceptibility to the solute carrier family 11 member 1 (SLC11A1) gene polymorphisms of Korean patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with BD and 98 controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses of three polymorphisms of the SLC11A1 gene [the 5'-promoter (GT)n, D543N and A318V] were performed, either by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography for D543N and A318V or by using automatic DNA sequencing for the (GT)n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genotypes and alleles between patients with BD and the controls were compared using the chi2 test and Yate's correction test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the distribution of genotypes and alleles of the (GT)n polymorphism between BD patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, subjects with the allele 3 or the genotype allele 3/allele 3 of this polymorphism had a significantly lower risk of developing BD than those without this allele or genotype [allele: p = 0.029, pc = 0.039, odds ratio (OR) = 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.95; genotype: p = 0.036, pc = 0.048, OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.96] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the distributions of genotypes and alleles of D543N were similar between BD patients and controls (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case of A318V, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the BD patients and controls had a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The allele 3 and the genotype allele 3/allele 3 of the 5'-promoter (GT)n in the SLC11A1 gene may have a protective effect for the development of BD in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies in other populations are required to confirm our results </plain></SENT>
