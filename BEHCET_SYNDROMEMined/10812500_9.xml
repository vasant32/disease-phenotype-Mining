<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In various studies serum levels of IL-8 were reported to be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-8 mRNA was purified from both peripheral whole blood samples and separated lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes of patients with BD and compared to that from healthy (HC) and disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-8 sequences were revealed by PCR amplification using appropriate sequence-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were determined semi-quantitatively using an image analyser in comparison with beta-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the differences did not reach statistical significance, BD patients tended to have higher IL-8 mRNA levels compared to HC in whole blood samples (2.0 +/- 1.4 vs 1.5 +/- 1.2) as well as in their lymphocytes (2.7 +/- 1.6 vs 1.5 +/- 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between BD and HC in monocyte or granulocyte IL-8 mRNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the cellular source of IL-8 is diverse in BD with a possible major contribution by lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
