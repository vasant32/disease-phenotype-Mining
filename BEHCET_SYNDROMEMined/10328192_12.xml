<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study at a university referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients were given topical sucralfate or placebo 4 times a day for 3 months and examined clinically at biweekly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: For each lesion, the mean frequency, healing time, and pain were evaluated during the pretreatment, treatment, and follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients were given any concurrent disease-specific or immunosuppressive topical and systemic drugs during the 9-month study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 40 patients included in the study, the results in 30 patients (16 patients treated with sucralfate and 14 patients treated with placebo, ranging in age from 16 to 52 years [mean+/-SD age, 34.3+/-8.1 years]) were evaluable for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with sucralfate decreased significantly the mean frequency, healing time, and pain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> and healing time and pain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> compared with the pretreatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of sucralfate on the frequency and healing time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> continued during the post-treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, no significant difference was found in measured parameters of oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> except the pain of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> between the pretreatment and treatment periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed that topical sucralfate suspension is an easy, safe, inexpensive, and effective treatment for oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
