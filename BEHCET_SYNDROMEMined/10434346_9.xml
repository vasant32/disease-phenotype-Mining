<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Though thalidomide in a dosage of 100 mg/day is the standard treatment for recurrent oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (OGU), its toxicity would be less important with lower dosage, while its efficacy would be identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, duration of treatment might be a major risk factor for the development of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the dosage of thalidomide leading to the best efficacy/toxicity ratio, a pilot study was conducted from 1993 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with OGU (mean age: 43 years, sex-ratio: 12:5) were included in the study and presented either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulcerations</z:e> (8 patients), <z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> (3 patients), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (4 patients), or recurrent OGU associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial dosage of thalidomide was 50 mg/day (1 tablet) for 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the patient's condition improved, the dosage was reduced to one tablet every other day for 1 month and one tablet every 3 days thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nerve conduction studies (EMG) were performed at inclusion in the study and every 6 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 17 patients, remission was observed in ten patients within the first month of treatment and the condition of seven patients improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was observed in six patients after a 2-month treatment and in one patient after 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 200-mg/8 days dosage induced prolonged remission in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among them, ten patients received a 150-mg dosage over 8 days thereafter and disease relapsed in four of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the six patients who received a 100-mg dosage over 8 days, only one relapse was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EMG showed a decrease in sensory nerve action potentials in six patients after 8 months and a half on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only three patients had to discontinue their treatment due to the occurrence of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> (2 patients) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that initially a 50-mg/day dose is efficacious in the treatment of OGU and that administration of one tablet every 2 or 3 days is efficacious in more than 60% of the patients to maintain remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A dosage of 50 mg/day is initially efficacious in most cases, provided that the patient is carefully followed up to allow early detection of potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
