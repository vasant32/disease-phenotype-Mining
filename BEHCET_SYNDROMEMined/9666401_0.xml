<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) caused by cardiovascular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was retrospectively analyzed in five patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease complicated by moderate or severe AR (four men and one woman, with a mean age of 47 +/- 5.8 years; complete 1, incomplete 2, and suspected 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was larger than 60 mm (mean: 74 mm) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the left ventricular fractional shortening was less than 0.28 in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed in four patients, but perivalvular regurgitation developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after a mean of 5.4 +/- 1.2 months (range: 0.6-10 months) following surgery, causing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient (grade III) who did not undergo operation showed gradually increasing end-diastolic diameter, but he is still being followed up medically due to the poor outcome of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced tissue fragility, AVR was associated with postoperative perivalvular regurgitation and suture breakdown, resulting in an extremely poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, AVR was considered best avoided even if <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was complicated with moderate or severe AR </plain></SENT>
