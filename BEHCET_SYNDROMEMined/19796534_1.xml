<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective cohort study of 18 neuro-BD patients, CSF samples were studied for MMP-9, TIMP-1 and cell characteristics in neuro-BD patients compared to 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> attributed to BD (HaBD) patients, 15 multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) and 20 Non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disease</z:e> (NIND) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were measured in CSF by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was significantly increased in neuro-BD group (mean +/- SD: 0.145+/-0.045) compared to (HaBD) (0.065+/-0.029; p=0.0001) and NIND patients (0.070+/-0.031; p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between neuro-BD and MS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between CSF-PMN cells and MMP-9 in neuro-BD patients (r=0.714; p=0.0009), indicating probably that PMN cells were in part the source of MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly positive correlation was also observed between MMP-9 and CSF-mononuclear cells in neuro-BD patients (r=0.623; p=0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 in cerebrospinal fluid of neuro-BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It demonstrates increased matrix metalloproteinase-9/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that MMPs released in the CSF may be involved in the pathogenesis of neuro-BD by promoting local damage, similarly as suspected in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
