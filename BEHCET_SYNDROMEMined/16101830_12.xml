<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51 is known to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) in many ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic gene, however, may lie close to the HLA-B locus and therefore be in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the proximity of MIC genes to HLA-B, their expression pattern and their affinity for the activating NKG2D receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and gammadelta T cells, these molecules have been postulated as susceptibility factors in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from 56 western European Caucasians with BD and 90 Caucasian controls were analysed by polymerase chain reaction using allele-specific primers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> and MICB alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increased allele frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 was found in the BD patient group (25.0%) when compared with the controls (7.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a corresponding decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*008 in the BD patients (36.6%) compared with the controls (46.7%), which was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 was strongly associated with the presence of HLA-B*51 in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in frequency of MICB alleles was found between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both HLA-B*51 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 are strongly associated with BD in a pure Caucasian BD patient group, and the two alleles are in linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No MICB allele was found to associate significantly with the disease, an unexpected finding considering the close proximity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> and MICB loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that while MICB does not influence the development of BD, polymorphisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> may be pathogenic, perhaps through the interaction with NK and gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
