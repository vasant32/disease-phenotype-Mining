<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 104 BD patients fulfilling the International Study Group Criteria for the diagnosis of BD and 121 healthy individuals-controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 104 patients, 50 (48%) had vascular involvement: 34 had active-history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, 16 had arterial involvement (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>), and 11 of these patients had both venous and arterial lesions as confirmed by Doppler ultrasound and/or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotype analysis of the TYMS promoter enhancer region was determined by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the TYMS genotypes 2R/2R, 2R/3R, 3R/3R, 4R/2R, and 3R/3R were not significantly different between BD patients and control group (p&gt;0.05; 16.5% vs 8.3%, 49.0% vs 53.9%, 31.7% vs 38.0%, 1.9% vs 0%, and 1.0% vs 0%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TYMS genotypes were not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (14.87+/-8.99 micromol/L) was significantly higher than the level in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (10.78+/-3.81 micromol/L; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentrations were not different between the BD patients and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study results suggest that the distribution TYMS genotype in BD was not different from that of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between TYMS genotype and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels in BD patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
