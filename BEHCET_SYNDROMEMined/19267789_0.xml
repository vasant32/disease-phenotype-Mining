<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological involvement is observed in about 5% of the patients with BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is a frequently reported symptom with or without neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case-series, we aim to demonstrate the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> associated with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in consecutive BD patients who had been referred for neurologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The case-series included 17 patients (11 males [65%]), mean age 41 +/- 11.4, who met the criteria for BD established by the International Study Group for BD and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> during the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen BD patients were identified, the neurologic presentations included in parenchymal involvement 12 (70%), extraparenchymal involvement/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in 5 (30%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder in 2 (12%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306597" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric problems</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in 5 (30%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> according to the patients' reports included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo>, moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> with unilateral localization and throbbing quality accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and aggravation upon awakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because neurological involvement is one of the most devastating aspects of BD, the need to treat neurological involvement as early as possible, the possible role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> as an early indicator for neurological involvement in this relatively uncommon disease should be kept in mind </plain></SENT>
