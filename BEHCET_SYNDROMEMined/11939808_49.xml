<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the therapeutic efficacy of interferon alfa-2a in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A randomized placebo-controlled and double-blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifty patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patients were given interferon alfa-2a, 6 x 10(6) IU, subcutaneously 3 times per week or placebo for 3 months, and examined clinically at weekly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each mucocutaneous lesion and articular symptom, the mean frequency and duration were evaluated during the 3-month pretreatment, treatment, and follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pain for oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ocular inflammatory score, the frequency of attacks, and changes in visual acuities for patients with ocular involvement were assessed before the study, at the end of treatment, and during the follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, overall responses at the end of the treatment period were graded as follows: complete remission, disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical signs and symptoms during treatment; partial remission, greater than a 50% decrease in the frequency, duration, and severity of pain for oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and/or a decrease in the severity and frequency of ocular attacks; stable disease, less than a 50% change in the clinical signs and symptoms; and no effect or deterioration, ineffectiveness or worsening of clinical signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three interferon alfa-2a- and 21 placebo-treated patients, ranging in age from 16 to 55 years (mean +/- SD age, 32.38 +/- 7.94 years), were evaluable for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interferon alfa-2a treatment significantly decreased the duration (P=.02) and pain (P=.01) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (P=.03) and papulopustular lesions (P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions (P=.77 and.27, respectively), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (P=.29 and.61, respectively), and articular symptoms (P=.92 and.74, respectively) also decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>But there were no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An improvement in the severity and the frequency of ocular attacks occurred in 5 of 6 patients in the interferon alfa-2a-treated group and in 1 of 3 patients in the placebo-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 patients in the interferon alfa-2a-treated group, 15 responded to treatment (2 complete and 13 partial responses); and of the 21 patients in the placebo group, 3 responded to treatment (3 partial responses) (P&lt;.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interferon alfa-2a is an effective alternative treatment for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, particularly for the management of the mucocutaneous lesions of the disease </plain></SENT>
