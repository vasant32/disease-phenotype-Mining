<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 30 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the non-active phase of their illness and 30 healthy volunteers were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> levels, Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The executive functions of the patients were evaluated by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Stroop Test (ST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory scores measured in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease group, in which no clinically serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was observed, were higher than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, it was observed that the scores of neuropsychological tests of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease group were found to be significantly lower, especially in WCST, while significant relations were revealed between Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory scores and WCST, ST scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors' findings suggest that there may be factors other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> causing executive impairment in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease without explicit neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Executive dysfunctions may occur in association with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011570" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive states</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease stress or silent and/or future neurological involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, especially in the frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
