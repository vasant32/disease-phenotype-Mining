<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble (s)ICAM-1 but not sVCAM-1 is associated with relapse in idiopathic uveoretinitis and is reported to be raised in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the levels of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 in Palestinian patients with BD and related them to both ocular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> activity and to immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 51 patients (43 male, 8 female; mean ages 29.8 &amp; 31.9 yr) were examined at the St John Ophthalmic Hospital during a one year period (135 consultations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was determined from history and standard ocular examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>Anterior uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitritis</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> acted as markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral venous sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 levels were determined by standard ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 53 healthy age- and sex-matched clinic staff members acted as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were both significantly lower in patients on systemic immunosuppression than in those off treatment (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients off systemic treatment, sICAM was higher in the group with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> but quiet eyes (p = 0.003), but not in those with active ocular disease (p = 0.09), compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>sVCAM was not raised in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Systemic immunosuppression was associated with reduced sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, supporting a role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>sICAM-1 levels were raised in association with inflammatory features implicating endothelial activation in active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean sICAM-1 was higher in active ocular patients than controls </plain></SENT>
