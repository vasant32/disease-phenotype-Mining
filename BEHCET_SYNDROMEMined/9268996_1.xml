<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the existence of a connection between serum anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular complications in BD is investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum aCL antibody levels were quantified in 31 patients with BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom fulfilled the major criteria of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated in terms of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum aCL antibody levels were determined through the ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with the chi-squared test and the Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 12 patients with high aCL antibody levels, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was detected in 5 and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was present in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistically significant relation between these complications and serum aCL antibody elevation (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on this series of 31 patients with BD, there does not seem to be a significant correlation between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular complications and serum aCL antibody levels </plain></SENT>
