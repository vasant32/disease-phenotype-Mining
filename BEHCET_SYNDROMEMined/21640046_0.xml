<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> is an interesting issue in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate if <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or a special type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was correlated with silent neurologic involvement in BD patients without any neurologic sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed on 120 BD patients (30 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 30 with non-structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of BD and 30 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine headache</z:hpo>, 30 with tension type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>) and 30 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some neurophysiologic tests of brain stem; temporalis muscle exteroceptive suppression periods (ESP) and brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) were performed in the patients, when they were not in an attack period of the disease, and control subjects to investigate the presence of silent neurologic involvement and the relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and silent neurologic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some electrophysiological abnormalities, as right BAEP 1-5 interpeak latency prolongation (p=0.01) and left ESP2 duration shortening (p&lt;0.005), were seen in BD patients compared to healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patients with non-structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of BD were found to have shorter ESP1 and 2 durations (p&lt;0.001) and longer ESP1 latencies (p&lt;0.05), with respect to the other patient subgroups with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and healthy control group, showing brain stem pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, they had longer right BAEP 3-5 interpeak latency as compared to the patient subgroup without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a silent neurologic involvement in BD and this involvement may be in relation with a particular type of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, named as non-structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So, in clinical evaluation of BD patients, this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> may be considered as a warning message for neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
