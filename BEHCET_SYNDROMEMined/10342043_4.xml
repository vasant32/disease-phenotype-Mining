<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In a search for serum markers of disease activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, we measured the levels of the soluble form of ICAM-1 (sICAM-1), CD4 (sCD4), CD8 (sCD8) and interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) in the serum of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and Vogt-Koyanagi-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Harada's disease</z:e> (VKH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 20 patients with active BD (treated with tacrolimus), 15 patients with inactive BD, 24 patients with VKH [20 of them successfully treated with systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (cured group) and 4 of them with two or more episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> after withdrawal of systemic steroid (recurrence group)], and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum sICAM-1, sCD4, sCD8 and sIL-2R were measured by sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sera from patients with BD in the convalescent stage showed significantly higher levels of sICAM-1 than those in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with active BD in both stages or VKH in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage had significantly higher levels of serum sCD4 and sIL-2R than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of sCD8 in patients with both diseases in both stages differed significantly compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was noted in the pattern of decline of these soluble markers after treatment in the cured and recurrence groups of VKH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between the serum levels of sCD4 and sIL-2R in patients with both diseases in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that these soluble markers may represent potentially useful parameters to monitor disease activity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in certain types of autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
