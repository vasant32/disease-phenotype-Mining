<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">zinc sulfate</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were recruited in this study between November 2001 and February 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clinical manifestations index (CMI) was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum zinc was estimated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients both at the beginning and monthly throughout the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum zinc levels were estimated from 30 healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects matched for age and sex as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly allocated to receive either 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">zinc sulfate</z:chebi> or identical placebo tablet three times daily in a double-blind manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of starting treatment, patients were crossed over, that is, patients on placebo received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">zinc sulfate</z:chebi> and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean serum zinc level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients was statistically significantly lower than mean serum zinc levels in healthy the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group A (started with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">zinc sulfate</z:chebi>), the mean CMI started to decline directly after the first month of therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">zinc sulfate</z:chebi> to significantly lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After shifting to placebo treatment in the fourth month, the mean of CMI started to rise again gradually but remained significantly lower than levels before therapy for the fourth and fifth months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group B (started with placebo), the mean of CMI remained high for the first 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After crossing over to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">zinc sulfate</z:chebi> in the fourth month, the mean of CMI started to decrease after the fourth month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation between CMI and serum zinc level was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No side-effects were seen in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">zinc sulfate</z:chebi> was found to be a good option in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
