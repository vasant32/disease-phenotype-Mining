<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several hypotheses have been postulated and cytokines that control growth proliferation and hematopoiesis of progenitor cells play a role in relation to immune response and inflammatory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether cytokines play a role in pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We employed the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique, in which antibody is already coated on the microtiter plate standard and samples are pipetted into the wells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antigen present is bound by immobilized antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After incubation and washing steps, conjugate, which is enzyme linked polyclonal antibody specific for the antigen is added to the wells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following a wash to remove any unbound antibody enzyme reagent, a substrate solution is added to the wells, and color develops in proportion to the antigen bound in the initial steps, which can be read in terms of optical density present in the standards and in the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of a total of 53 samples with BD, 33 (64%) had detectable levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha and interferon-gamma were not significantly elevated in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that IL-8 levels are higher in patients with active BD, and since IL-8 has a potent effect on the neutrophil, this cytokine most likely participates in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> of this disease </plain></SENT>
