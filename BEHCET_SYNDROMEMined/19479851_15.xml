<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells and the level of differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) into NK cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with SLE (n=108), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA; n=90), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (n=39), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (n=41) and healthy control subjects (n=173) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NK cell levels, NK cell cytotoxicities, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activities against K562 cells were measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NK cells were differentiated from peripheral blood and bone marrow <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Percentages and absolute numbers of NK cells, cytotoxicities, and LAK activities were significantly lower in the peripheral blood of SLE and RA patients than in that of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, this NK cell deficiency was more prominent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, purified NK cells derived from SLE patients, but not RA patients, were found to have lower cytotoxicities and LAK activities than those from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This defect of NK cells in SLE patients was found to be related to lower numbers of NK precursors and to the down-regulation of perforin and granzyme in NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proliferative capacity of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, the percentages of NK cells differentiated from <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, and NK cell cytotoxicities were significantly lower in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In SLE patients, circulating levels of NK cells were diminished and their cytotoxicities were impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the differentiation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> into NK cells was found to be defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities possibly contribute to immune system dysregulation in SLE </plain></SENT>
