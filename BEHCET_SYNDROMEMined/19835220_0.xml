<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no reliable diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD have been developed yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, IBD Study Group of KASID was formulated to establish the guideline for the diagnosis of intestinal BD using a modified Delphi process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The novel diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD were developed based on two aspects; colonoscopic findings and extra-intestinal systemic manifestations, in which patients were categorized into 4 groups including definite, probable, suspected, and non-diagnostic for intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Disease Activity Index for intestinal BD was developed through a Korean multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These diagnostic and disease activity guidelines will contribute to understand intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
