<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluated the genital involvement in women with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) by cervical cytology and colposcopy, and compared these findings with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 152 women were referred to the Gynecology Clinic of Meram School of Medicine between March 2008 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group was composed of 78 women with BD, and the control group included 74 healthy women admitted for routine gynecologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were subjected to cervical cytology and colposcopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cervical biopsy was performed in cases with abnormal cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings and some gynecologic complaints were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The demographic features were similar between each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genital involvement (scar + <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>) was detected in 58 (74.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common sites of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (55.1%) and scars (7.6%) were the labia majora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormal cytology in study and control groups was detected in nine (11.5%) and three (4%) of the patients, respectively, and a slight statistical significance was obtained (p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acetowhite and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-negative epithelium were higher in the study group than in controls (p = 0.015 and p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013394,C1384606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">Dyspareunia</z:e> was higher in BD patients (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with BD are more prone to having an abnormal cervical cytology and acetowhite and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-negative epithelium on colposcopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, these findings are mostly benign conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The complaint of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013394,C1384606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">dyspareunia</z:e> should be considered during treatment of female patients with BD </plain></SENT>
