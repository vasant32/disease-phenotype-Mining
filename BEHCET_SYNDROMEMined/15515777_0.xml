<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports indicate the presence of primarily CD4+ T cells of the Th1 subtype in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> process of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum soluble CD30 (sCD30) is reported to be released from CD4+ Th2 type cells and has been suggested to be a marker of Th2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, serum sCD30 levels were measured in active and inactive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, healthy controls and a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, typical Th1 disorder using enzyme immunoassay kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean sCD30 value of 54 active patients were found significantly higher than in those of 17 inactive patients (p = 0.027), 20 healthy controls (p = 0.040) and 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between increased sCD30 levels and clinical activity index in active patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High serum levels of sCD30 may reflect the activation of CD4+ T cells or a subset of them in active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to serum sCD30 levels, measurements of the Th2 cytokines may be a helpful tool for the evaluation of Th2 activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
