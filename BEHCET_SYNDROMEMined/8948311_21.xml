<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mutation was present in the heterozygous state in 37.5% of the patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (12/32) and in 9.4% of the patients without any thrombotic event (3/32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven healthy individuals were also heterozygous for the mutation (10.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the mutation in BD patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was significantly different (P = 0.0079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the factor V gene mutation may play a major role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
