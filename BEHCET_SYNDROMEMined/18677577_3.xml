<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is a powerful, endogenous orexigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, ghrelin has anti-inflammatory effects, and it has been reported that ghrelin down-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Obestatin appears to decrease food intake and appetite, and its potential role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to assess total and acylated (active) ghrelin and obestatin serum levels and their relations with inflammatory status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Fasting blood samples were obtained from 37 patients with RA, 29 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and 28 healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total ghrelin and obestatin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay and acylated ghrelin was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with RA had lower total ghrelin, but higher obestatin levels than patients with BD (p&lt;0.05 for both), but when compared with HC group differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference across groups in terms of acylated ghrelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total ghrelin level was not correlated with any study parameters in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Obestatin level correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and DAS-28 in the RA group, the level of IL-6 in the BD group, and with the level of TNF-alpha in the HC group (r=0.400, p&lt;0.05; r=0.412, p&lt;0.05, r=0.543, p&lt;0.01 and r=0.528, p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not show a significant correlation between circulating ghrelin and clinical or laboratory markers of disease activity in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, obestatin correlated with some inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So, obestatin seems to be more valuable than ghrelin in the pathogenesis of RA </plain></SENT>
