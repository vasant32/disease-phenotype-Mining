<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To screen aberrant serum proteins in BD, serum samples were obtained from eight male BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and eight male healthy volunteers with informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum samples from active BD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Highly abundant serum proteins (albumin and IgG) were depleted from these two samples using an affinity capture based kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The obtained samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein spots were visualized with the "blue silver" staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differently expressed proteins were subsequently identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption /ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed using the serum samples from 18 patients with active BD, 6 patients with inactive BD, 22 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, and 20 healthy volunteers to validate the results of 2-DE and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteomic profiles of the pooled samples were compared, and approximately 800 protein spots were observed in each of the gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of four of the protein spots in active BD were significantly higher than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometric protein identification revealed that the four protein spots corresponded to two proteins: haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Western blot and ELISA showed that Hp was only overexpressed in active BD but not in inactive BD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e>, or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An obvious band of SAA was detected in 72.2% of the serum samples from BD patients, whereas a vague band of this protein was found in 10.0% of the tested <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples and 9.1% of VKH samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed a significantly increased expression of Hp and SAA in serum of active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These two proteins may be involved in the development of BD </plain></SENT>
