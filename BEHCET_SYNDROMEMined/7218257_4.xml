<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the mechanism by which neutrophils from the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were hyperchemotactic </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extracts from the disrupted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s neutrophils increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocyte response to the chemotactic stimulus more strongly than extracts from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s neutrophils have a higher concentration of the cytoplasmic activator might play an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperchemotaxis </plain></SENT>
