<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51 is considered a susceptibility marker and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> alleles have also been associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes have been suggested as responsible for BD lesions by engaging <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> through NKG2D surface molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, HLA-B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> alleles were typed by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers, in 165 healthy Spanish controls and 42 BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the healthy group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*008 (28.48%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*004 (17.58%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*002 (14.24%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 (9.39%) were the predominant alleles and the most common haplotype was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*004-B*44 (12.12%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results have been reported in North African individuals and this could support the hypothesis of a common ancestral origin of both populations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*019 had not been described in other BD cohorts, and it corroborates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> locus in BD patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results argue against the hypothesis of an autoaggressive response in BD patients through <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-NKG2D interactions </plain></SENT>
