<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used the Korean translation of the disease-specific, self-administered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> Questionnaire (IBDQ) to compare HRQOL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC; n = 98), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD; n = 49), and intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD; n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the current status, patients were asked retrospectively to recall their symptoms at the beginning and during the worst period of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was measured by St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mark's Activity Index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> Activity Index (CDAI), and the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IBD patients, including those with BD, the IBDQ total score during the worst period was significantly lower than that at present and that at the beginning of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences between groups regarding the total IBDQ score or its various dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In UC a strong correlation between IBDQ scores and St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mark's Activity Index was observed (r = -0.708, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IBDQ scores were also highly correlated with CDAI and HBI in both CD (r = -0.506, P &lt; 0.001 for CDAI; r = -0.600, P &lt; 0.001 for HBI) and BD (r = -0.687, P &lt; 0.001 for CDAI; r = -0.531, P &lt; 0.001 for HBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the current IBDQ score was not related to demographic parameters such as gender, age, educational status, economic status, and marital status as well as disease factors such as duration of disease, history of operation or hospital admission, extent of disease in UC, involved region in CD, and clinical type in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Korean IBDQ is a responsive and promising instrument for measuring HRQOL of IBD patients in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, the IBDQ can be helpful in developing a disease-specific activity index in BD </plain></SENT>
