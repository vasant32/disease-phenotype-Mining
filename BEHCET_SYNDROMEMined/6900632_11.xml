<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C9 was elevated in both groups of patients and was the sensitive index of disease activity; however, it failed to discriminate between the three types of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and four types of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of alpha 1 acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and lysozyme were significantly increased predominantly in the ocular type, whereas factor B was significantly increased especially in the neurological type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the changes in the concentrations of some plasma proteins may help our understanding of tissue involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, as well as in the selection of therapeutic agents in this disease </plain></SENT>
