<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are associated with transport of lysosomes and movement of the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Augmentations of the lysosomal enzyme activity and chemotactic activity are found in the neutrophils of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> which induces microtubule depolymerization is effective in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined microtubules in the neutrophils of 24 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, by an indirect immunofluorescence technique, to investigate the significance of the microtubules in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the microtubules was different between the patients in the exacerbation stage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and also between the exacerbation stage and the remission stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that microtubules play some significant role in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
