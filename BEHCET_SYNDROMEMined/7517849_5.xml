<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 54 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 41 males and 13 females, mean age 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients had auditory brain-stem evoked potential (BAEP) recordings, 39 had pattern reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP), 27 had median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) recordings, and 25 tibial nerve SEPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BAEPs were abnormal in 16 patients (52%) with neurological manifestations and in 4 (31%) without, because of decreased amplitude of wave V, prolonged I-III or III-V interpeak latencies, or uncertain/absent waves III and/or V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (40%) with neurological symptoms and 3 patients (25%) without, had abnormal VEPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absent potentials, decreased amplitude, with or without prolonged P100 latency, were found in 75% of the cases, the rest had prolonged P100 latency only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median SEPs were abnormal in 8 patients (38%) with neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients (21%) had abnormal tibial SEPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased amplitude with or without mild slowing in central conduction was the predominant SEP abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SEPs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In total, 84% of patients with, and 38% of patients without, neurological symptoms had abnormalities of one or more EP modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When used cautiously, EP studies in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease might be helpful to separate neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet from other disorders with similar symptomatology, to disclose subclinical <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, to evaluate and monitor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease activity, and to provide objective measures of treatment response </plain></SENT>
