<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative oral/intramuscular bioavailability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> was only 13%, and the steady-state concentrations of this drug on four consecutive days were acutely subtherapeutic (i.e., 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, and 3.7 micrograms/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi>, phenytoin, and acetaminophen in plasma were nonmeasurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examination of the gastrointestinal tract by endoscopy and by light and electronic microscopy of a biopsy section revealed inflammatory and vascular changes in the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence of clinical evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> syndrome, we believe that the decreased drug absorption observed in this patient was caused by inflammatory changes associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
