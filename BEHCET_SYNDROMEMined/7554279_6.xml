<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease has been intensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PMN elastase, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactant, was investigated to determine whether it may serve as a biochemical marker in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, protein electrophoresis, immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM), complement components (C3, C4) as well as PMN elastase were evaluated in 42 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 40 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean PMN elastase levels were found to be 244.2 micrograms/l (median 210 micrograms/l, S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>126.8) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 44.3 micrograms/l (median 45, S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>19.2) in healthy subjects (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mean PMN elastase levels were found to be 321.5 micrograms/l (median 300, S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>117.9) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and 159 micrograms/l (median 162, S.D </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that PMN elastase may be a good biochemical marker for diagnosis and therapy control in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
