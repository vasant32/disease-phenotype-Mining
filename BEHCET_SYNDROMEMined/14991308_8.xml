<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up to now ocular involvement has a poor visual prognosis irrespective of immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Now recent open studies have shown that interferon alfa-2a (IFN alfa-2a) is very effective in the treatment of ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term development of visual acuity (VA) in patients with severe ocular BD who were treated with IFN alfa-2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 15 eyes of 9 patients with an active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> and/or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> due to BD refractory to immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VA before initiation of IFN-therapy was compared to VA at the end of the follow-up time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 68.8+/-10.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of IFN-treatment was 40.6+/-17.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one patient IFN alfa-2a could be discontinued in complete remission of ocular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up time 10 eyes showed an increase of VA of two lines or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 5 eyes VA remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no decrease of VA in any eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If a macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was present, a quick response to IFN alfa-2a was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No eye developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000543'>pale optic disk</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, interferon alfa-2a seems to be much more effective to prevent a loss or decrease of VA over a long period of time in patients with severe ocular BD </plain></SENT>
