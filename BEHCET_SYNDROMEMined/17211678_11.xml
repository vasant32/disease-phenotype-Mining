<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is not fully understood and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> and genetic factors have been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because serum concentrations of mainly T helper 1 (Th1) type cells have been reported to be increased in BD, we aimed to investigate whether certain cytokine polymorphisms might represent a risk factor for developing BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 80 patients with BD and 105 healthy controls for interleukin (IL)-1 alpha (T/C -889), IL-1 beta (C/T -511, T/C +3962), IL-1R (C/T pst11970), IL-1RA (T/C mspa111100), IL-2 (T/G -330), IL-12 (C/A -1188), interferon (IFN)-gamma (A/T UTR 5644), and TNF-alpha (G/A -238) polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses of cytokine polymorphisms were performed with PCR-SSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotype and allele frequencies of the patients and controls were compared and the association between the polymorphisms of the cytokines with the clinical findings was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotype distribution showed significant differences between the patients and the controls for the IL-1 alpha -889, IL-1 beta -511, IL-1 beta +3962, IL-1R, IL-12, IFN- gamma, and TNF-alpha cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We didn't observe significant difference in genotypic frequencies of IL-1RA and IL-2 in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the IL-1 alpha -889, IL 1 beta -511, and IL 1 beta +3962 genotype frequencies showed significant increase in CC genotype between the patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The individuals with IL-1R TT polymorphism had a higher risk for BD compared to patients with CT/CC polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of IL-12, IFN- gamma, and TNF-alpha, genotype frequencies showed significant increase in CA, AA, and AA genotypes between the patients and controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of genotypes according to the clinical features of the patients with BD did not show a significant difference (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that development of BD might be determined by various cytokine gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further studies on larger numbers of cases are needed before definite conclusions can be drawn </plain></SENT>
