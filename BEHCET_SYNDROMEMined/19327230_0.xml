<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to verify that cytokine augmentation is induced by irradiation in vivo, and to assess the effectiveness of radiation in treating <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Whole-body and half-body irradiation with single doses of 10cGy, 2Gy and 10Gy were delivered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice, and cytokine and chemokine levels were analyzed in PBMC and sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BD-like mice were treated with low-dose, half-body 10cGy irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice, PBMC cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels peaked four days after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the cytokines and chemokines examined, the levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-12p40, TNF-alpha, TGF-b, MIP-1alpha and IL-18 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> influenced by radiation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, IL-4, an ameliorating factor for BD, was the most elevated following low-dose irradiation (10cGy group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FACS analysis showed intracellular IL-4-staining of 7.24+/-0.92% of PBMC from irradiated mice compared to 1.3+/-0.1% from non-irradiated, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-4 levels were also significantly increased (6.08+/-1.7 pg/ml) relative to control (1.83+/-0.8; p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Augmentation of cytokine production may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of low dose irradiation and amelioration of BD symptoms in this mouse model </plain></SENT>
