<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examined the hypothesis that the polymorphism of Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) predisposes to and/or influences the clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1, two DARC-binding chemokines, were investigated and related to this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 30 healthy blood donors were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No null phenotypes were found among the patients studied, and the frequencies of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005395'>other phenotypes</z:mp> (Fy((a+b-)), Fy((a+b+)), and Fy((a-b+))) did not significantly differ from those found in the blood donor group or reported in the general Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between the single phenotypes in terms of IL-8 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 serum levels, and no relevant association between the clinical characteristics, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51, and single phenotypes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This investigation indicates that DARC is not a genetic trait significantly associated with or predisposing to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, at least in Caucasian Italians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the role of this polymorphism in the development and in the clinical course of the disease awaits further investigation </plain></SENT>
