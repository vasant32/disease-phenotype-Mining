<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The initiating cause of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is unknown, but an aberrant response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and associated molecules that have a sentinel function at mucosal surfaces were analysed in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TLR expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in buccal mucosal tissue from patients with BD, in tissue from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lichen planus</z:e> (LP) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_628'>pyogenic granuloma</z:mpath> (PG) as disease controls, or from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using SSP-PCR we analysed SNP in CD14, TLR2, TLR4 and TIRAP (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein) in patients with BD from different geographical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TLR expression was increased in buccal lesions from patients with BD compared with healthy controls; however, a similar increase was seen in lesion tissue from patients with LP or PG, suggesting that this was a generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> as opposed to a BD-specific response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP analysis showed no association between CD14, TLR2 or TLR4 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, TIRAP 180Leu was significantly associated with BD in UK, but not Middle Eastern, patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TLR expression showed no difference in tissue from patients with BD compared with either disease or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, SNPs in TLR genes were no different from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association with the increased function variant of TIRAP suggests that encounter with a pathogen at mucosal sites will lead to increased cytokine production and tissue damage with persistence of mucosal lesions </plain></SENT>
