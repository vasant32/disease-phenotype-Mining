<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) is a multisystemic disorder that is classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and can affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types and sizes of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> are not regarded as essential for a diagnosis of BD, vascular complications can be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics of 14 patients with BD accompanied by an obstruction of the superior vena cava (VC), the inferior VC, or both, and then determine the dermatological features that indirectly suggest VC obstructions in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among the 3500 patients registered at the BD Specialty Clinic of Severance Hospital from 1997 to 2006, 14 patients were diagnosed with BD-associated VC obstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their medical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of the 14 patients with BD were male, and the age range for disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 11-46 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography revealed superior VC <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in seven patients, inferior VC <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in four patients, and the involvement of both in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most prominent features in superior VC obstruction were facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (n = 7, 50%) and neck vein distension (n = 6, 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other features included dilated veins in the chest wall, upper body <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, and upper extremity swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with an inferior VC obstruction commonly had dilated veins on the abdominal walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo> and lower extremity swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> with or without heparinization were the most common treatment regimens giving good response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Attempts to treat patients with a high dose of steroid pulse therapy were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ballooning venoplasty was a useful therapeutic modality for VC <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during the early stage, although this procedure could not be performed in patients with BD with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several cutaneous features of VC obstruction should be recognized in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early detection might permit an early diagnosis and treatment of occlusion of the VC </plain></SENT>
