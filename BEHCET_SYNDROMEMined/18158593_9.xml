<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is known to be associated with HLA-B*51 in many different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>), located near the HLA-B gene, has been proposed as a candidate gene for BD susceptibility in several ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To compare the relative contribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> polymorphisms and HLA-B*51 to BD in different ethnic groups, we studied <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> polymorphisms in Turkish BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three Turkish BD patients and 65 healthy controls were enrolled for analysis of polymorphisms in the extracellular domains of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The phenotype frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 were significantly higher in BD patients (75.8%) than in controls (29.2%) (P = 0.000015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51 was also significantly more frequent in BD patients (81.8%) than in controls (29.2%) (P = 0.0000007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong association existed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 and HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the confounding effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 on HLA-B*51, we performed a stratification analysis that showed that BD was distinctly associated only with HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the major susceptibility gene for BD is HLA-B*51 and that the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 and BD arises from a strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*009 likely elicits an immune effect secondary to BD </plain></SENT>
