<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> is also a well-defined component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet syndrome</z:e> (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of JAK2 ( V617F ) mutation in BS-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 152 patients with BS (62 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 90 without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional 186 patients with MPNs and 107 healthy blood donors were included to serve as diseased and healthy controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with BS and healthy controls carried the JAK2 (V617F) mutation, whereas 67% of patients with MPNs were positive for JAK2 ( V617F ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with MPNs was not statistically different between carriers and non-carriers of JAK2 ( V617F ) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that JAK2 (V617F) is not directly related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in MPNs and in other thrombotic entities, such as BS </plain></SENT>
