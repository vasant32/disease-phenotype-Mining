<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of MIP-1alpha in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and evaluated the association of the MIP-1alpha levels with disease activity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 67 BD patients and 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, whole blood cells were isolated from BD patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 11) and cultured in the absence or presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) plus ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of MIP-1alpha, interleukin-8 (IL-8), regulated on activation, normally T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) were measured in the sera and culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum levels of MIP-1alpha were higher in BD patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When whole blood cells were stimulated with LPS or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> plus ionomycin, but not PHA, BD patients had higher levels of MIP-1alpha in the culture supernatants compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In sera and culture supernatants of whole blood cells, MIP-1alpha levels correlated well with those of RANTES, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, and IL-8 in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with active disease had significantly higher levels of serum MIP-1alpha levels compared with those with inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MIP-1alpha levels were elevated in patients with BD, and correlated well with IL-8, RANTES, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the increased MIP-1alpha levels in serum of BD patients may lead to activation and migration of leukocytes, playing a role, like other chemokines, in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
