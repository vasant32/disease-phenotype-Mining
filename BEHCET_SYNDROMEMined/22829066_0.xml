<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of variations in heart rate has also been used to determine the balance between sympathetic and vagal nerve activities in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine HRR, the SBP response to exercise and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with BD in the absence of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 32 patients with BD and 30 healthy controls who were matched with respect to age, sex, and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate recovery was calculated as the difference between heart rate at peak exercise and heart rate at 1, 2, and 3 min of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure recovery indexes were determined by dividing the systolic blood pressure at 2 and 3 min in recovery to the systolic blood pressure at peak exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with BD, mean HRR at 1 min (HRR1) were not significantly different than that of controls (21 ± 7 vs 20 ± 7 bpm, p = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although, resting mean SBP of patients with BD was higher than controls (121 ± 13 vs 115 �� 12 mmHg, p = 0.039), the SBP recovery indices of the patients with BD at 2 and 3 min were similar to those of controls (0.84 ± 0.07 vs 0.84 ± 0.09, p = 0.89 and 0.78 ± 0.09 vs 0.78 ± 0.08, p = 0.93, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both time domain and frequency domain parameters of patients with BD were similar to that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the patients with BD have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HRR1 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SBP response to exercise and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings might suggest unaltered autonomic neural control of the cardiovascular system in this disorder in the absence of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
