<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities consisted of 3 cases of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 1 case of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease, 5 cases of infarction and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NMR transverse imaging using inversion recovery sequence was able to locate many of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intra-axial brainstem nuclei, such as the periaqueductal gray matter, the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, the pontine nuclei, the pontine reticular nuclei, the facial nerve nucleus and so on in an about half of 12 asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remarkable gray-white matter differentiation was obtained on NMR imaging using inversion recovery sequence and enabled the internal structures to be visualized within the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the midsagittal imaging provided an excellent demonstration of anatomical relationships of the brainstem and surrounding structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the diencephalic region, the mamillary body, the anterior commissure and the optic chiasma were also demonstrated on the midsagittal imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesions within the brainstem were vaguely shown on X-ray computed tomography in 6 of 12 patients but NMR imaging using inversion recovery or spin echo sequence provided more detailed data and revealed clear small lesions, such as the demyelinated plaques of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 9 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Especially, in 2 of 3 multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> patients, the plaques of the brainstem were definitely identified on NMR imaging only and the accurate localized lesion which was responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000317'>facial myokymia</z:hpo> or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455716" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Foville syndrome</z:e> was identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
