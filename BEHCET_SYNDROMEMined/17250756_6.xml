<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the presence of B19 DNA in <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of patients with BD, compare with the skin of healthy controls and evaluate its role in the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 40 patients diagnosed with BD according to the criteria proposed by the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease and routinely followed up at our centre were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients selected were in the active phase of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin and blood samples of patients with BD and of the healthy volunteers were examined for B19 serology, histopathology and genome expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The quantity of B19 DNA in nonulcerative BD lesions of was significantly different from ulcerative lesions in the study group and from the skin of the healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the nonulcerative lesions, real-time PCR analysis for B19 DNA was found to be 64% sensitive (95% CI 42.5-82.0) and 85% specific (95% CI 62.1-96.6) with a cut-off value of &gt; 154 IU/mL (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence for a possible causal link between BD and parvovirus B19, and our data suggest the presence of the virus, particularly in intact, nonulcerative <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Limitations to this study include the limited number of participants, and the fact that the exact source of B19 DNA was undetected </plain></SENT>
