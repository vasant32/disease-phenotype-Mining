<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the presence/absence of 14 killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their ligands in 134 Turkish individuals with BD and compared the results with those of 154 ethnically matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although KIR3DL1 with its ligand (HLA-Bw4) was significantly increased in the patients with BD (P = 0.0003), this no longer applied when the patients and controls were categorised by HLA-Bw51 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, no association was identified between presence or absence of any of the 14 KIR genes studied and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we did not find any associations of KIR with various manifestations of the disease nor with gender or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
