<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To compare the expression of chemokines in the aqueous humor and chemokine receptors in intraocular lymphocytes from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet and non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 95 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 39 Behçet and 56 non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis was performed using lymphocytes from the aqueous humor and the peripheral blood during the active phase of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the expression of CXCR1, CXCR3, and CCR5 in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and the concentration of intraocular CXCL8, CXCL10 and CCL5 in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet and non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CD4+ cell population was higher in the aqueous humor of non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients, whereas the CD8+ cell population was higher in the aqueous humor of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expressions of CXCR1 and CCR5 were not significantly different between the two groups, whereas the intraocular expression of CXCR3 was higher in the CD4+ cells of non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet and in the CD8+ cells of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraocular CXCL8 and CXCL10 levels were higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet than they were in non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CCL5 levels were not different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors in intraocular lymphocytes is different in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet compared to non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients, which might be related to the differential phenotypes of intraocular lymphocytes among different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> etiologies </plain></SENT>
