<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) activity, accepted as a nonspecific marker of T lymphocyte activation, may have a potential role in BD, and also may be related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activities and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>; endproduct of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation induced by ROS) levels in both plasma and erythrocytes were spectrophotometrically measured in 25 patients with BD and also in 25 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity was found to be higher in plasma, but lower in erythrocytes; plasma and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were higher in BD patients than those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity was positively related to <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels in both plasma (p &lt; 0.05) and erythrocytes (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also positive correlation between <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels (p &lt; 0.05), but negative correlations between <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activities (p &lt; 0.01) and also between <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> values in erythrocytes (p &lt; 0.01) of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings may provide some evidence for a potential role of T lymphocyte activation in BD as reflected by increased plasma <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity, and for the presence of possible interrelationship between activated T cells and neutrophil hyperfunctions, such as ROS generation, as reflected by increased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
