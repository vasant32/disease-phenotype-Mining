<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the CECs in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to demonstrate a possible association between CECs and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty individuals (45 Behçet's disease patients and 15 healthy controls) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function are included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood samples are first incubated with antiCD146 antibody and subsequently conjugated to immunomagnetic beads to isolate CECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells are stained with UEA-1 before counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients [7-135 cells/mL, mean 50 cells/mL, median 43 cells/mL (SD 35), P&lt;0.001] have elevated numbers of CECs compared to controls [3-14 cells/mL, mean 9 cells/mL, median 8 cells/mL (SD 4)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of CECs is higher in the active period of the disease compared to the inactive period </plain></SENT>
