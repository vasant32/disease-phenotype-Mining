<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used flow cytometry to investigate the expression of CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on PBN and SFN of fifty-five (22 RA, 22 BD and 11 OA) age and sex-matched patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In respect to chemokine receptor expression on neutrophils isolated from patients with RA, mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> intensity (MFI) of CXCR-1 chemokine receptors on PBN from active and inactive RA patients, and SFN from patients with RA were 151 (90-395), 129 (81-539) and 136 (64-220), respectively, and there were not statistically significant difference each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But MFI of CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on SFN of patients with RA was 18 (10-32), and significantly higher than PBN of active and inactive RA patients (MFI: 10 (6-15) and 12 (7-16), P=0.002 and 0.037, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In respect to chemokine receptor expression on neutrophils isolated from patients with BD, MFI of CXCR-1 chemokine receptors on PBN of active BD patients was 245 (97-844), and higher than PBN of active RA patients and SFN of BD patients (MFI: 151 (90-395) and 134 (61-231), P=0.047 and 0.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MFI of CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on PBN of active and inactive BD patients, and SFN of patients BD were 10 (6-14), 10 (2-16), and 12 (8-24), respectively, there were not statistically significant difference each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MFI of CXCR-1 chemokine receptors on SFN from patients with RA, BD, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> were 136 (64-220), 134 (61-231), and 114 (60-180), respectively, and there was no difference between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MFI of CXCR-2 chemokine receptors on SFN of patients with RA was 18 (10-32), and higher than patients with BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (MFI: 12 (8-24) and 11 (9-18), P=0.037 and 0.005, respectively), though there was no difference between last two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study points that CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 chemokine receptors of SFN may have diverse functions in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory arthritides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that CXCR-2 chemokine receptor might play more critical role in long lasting accumulation of neutrophils within the synovial fluid of patients with RA </plain></SENT>
