<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our routine preview of each case included examination with the Goldman three-mirror contact lens, ophthalmoscopy, referral for laboratory tests, color fundus photography and, most importantly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmological findings led to the proper diagnosis in 254 (85%) of our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography revealed incipient fundus changes in 38 eyes of 19 medically diagnosed patients with no visual complaints and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fundi on ophthalmoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of our cases had or developed diverse fundus changes bilaterally </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis is necessary for proper treatment patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
