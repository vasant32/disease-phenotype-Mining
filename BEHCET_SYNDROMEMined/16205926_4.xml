<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> by increasing the secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and also stimulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the synovial IL-18, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), and compare them with the levels of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>30 patients with BD, 20 with RA, and 20 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The synovial levels of IL-18, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and MMP-3 were detected using the two-step sandwich ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synovial IL-18, TNF-alpha and MMP-3 levels were significantly higher in RA patients than patients with BD (P=0.004, 0.019, 0.025, respectively) and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (P=0.004, 0.045, 0.032, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences, with respect to the cytokine levels, when patients with BD were compared with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with RA and BD had higher IL-1beta levels than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (P=0.017, 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no such difference was found for IL-1beta between BD and RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with RA, positive correlations were found between TNF-alpha and MMP-3 (r=0.683, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that MMP-3 and proinflammatory cytokines, except IL-1beta, were expressed in relatively small quantities in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detection of the lower levels of these cytokines and metalloproteinases might explain the non-erosive character of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that IL-1beta may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
