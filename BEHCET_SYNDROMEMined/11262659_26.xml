<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of interferon alfa-2a (IFN alfa) in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, that is refractory to steroids and conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (according to the International Study Group criteria), who relapsed despite steroids and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmological examination, laser flare photometry, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography associated with laboratory tests were performed at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN alfa (3 millions units thrice a week) was injected subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (sex ratio: 1) were included between May 1995 and January 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 29.1 years (14-54 years) and the disease was present between 11 and 167 months before the administration of IFN alfa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IFN alfa was efficient in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with a mean follow-up of 22 months (10-55 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Steroids were tapered from a mean dosage of 47 mg/d to a mean dosage of 8.5 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>Ocular inflammation</z:hpo> was controlled and visual acuity improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally well tolerated despite a constant but transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1558931" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">flu-like syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IFN alfa was tapered in three patients and stopped in one case without any relapse after five months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this retrospective study, low-dose IFN alfa seems to be well tolerated, promising in the management of refractory forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and effective in allowing a reduction of steroid dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A prospective controlled study is necessary to confirm these preliminary results </plain></SENT>
