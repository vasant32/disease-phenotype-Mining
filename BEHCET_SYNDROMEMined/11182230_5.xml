<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been revealed whether the HLA-B51 gene itself or another gene located near the HLA-B gene is directly involved in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, using Japanese BD patients, our group has narrowed down a BD-causative gene to 46 kb between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> and HLA-B genes by means of fine mapping analysis with eight microsatellite markers distributed within a 1100 kb segment around the HLA-B gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To know whether this mapping result is generally observed in BD of another population we have investigated repeat polymorphisms of the same microsatellite markers in Jordanian BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have evaluated these data by Mantel-Haenzel stratified analysis to find out a primarily associated locus for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, HLA-B51 was found to be the most strongly and primarily associated marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that the pathogenic gene of BD is HLA-B51 itself, but unlikely to be other genes located in the vicinity of HLA-B </plain></SENT>
