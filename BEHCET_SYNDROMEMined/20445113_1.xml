<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Inducible costimulator (ICOS) is an important costimulatory molecule involved in T-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the role of ICOS in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in the active or remission phase and in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was isolated from PMBCs, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was analyzed on an oligonucleotide microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICOS expression on CD4(+) T cells was determined by flow cytometry, and the functional costimulatory effect of ICOS/B7RP-1 interaction was assessed on stimulation with concanavalin A (conA) or IRBP in the presence or absence of anti-ICOS mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As the result of microarray analysis, ICOS in PBMCs showed the greatest difference in expression in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> compared with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICOS expression on CD4(+) T cells in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals, both before and after conA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the BD patients, ICOS expression on CD4(+) T cells was significantly higher in those with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> than in those with remitted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blockade of ICOS/B7-related protein-1 (B7RP-1) interaction by anti-ICOS mAb significantly decreased IFN-γ, IL-17, and TNF-α production by PBMCs when stimulated with conA or IRBP in BD with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High ICOS expression in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> contributed to the upregulation of IFN-γ, IL-17, and TNF-α production, suggesting that abnormal ICOS costimulation may play an immunopathologic role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
