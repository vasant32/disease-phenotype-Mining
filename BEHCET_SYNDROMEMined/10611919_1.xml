<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 50-year-old man with a right ventricular structure causing an intraventricular pressure gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had been diagnosed as vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet with a history of aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had also been suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and mild right-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed that there was an abnormal structure attached to the right ventricular free wall and protruding into the cavity, and that it caused the pressure gradient estimated to be approximately 19 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chest X-ray computed tomography demonstrated that the structure was partially calcified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging depicted the structure separating the right ventricle into two chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic study revealed a markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0008727'>enlarged right atrium</z:mp> and a filling defect at the mid-portion of the right ventricle, which divided the right ventricular cavity into two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic study showed a slightly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005168'>elevated right atrial pressure</z:hpo> (mean 7 mmHg) and a peak-to-peak intraventricular pressure difference of 18 mmHg in the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diastolic pressure tracing of the right ventricular low pressure chamber showed a 'dip and plateau' pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the pathological features of the abnormal right ventricular structure in this case were not fully clarified, abnormal muscle bundle and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006685'>endocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, which were reported to be associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, may have contributed to its generation </plain></SENT>
