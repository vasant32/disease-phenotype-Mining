<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e> of unknown etiology, immune complexes have been shown to be deposited in affected tissue during disease activity, suggesting an immune mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the relationship between Fn and circulating immune complexes (CIC) and evaluates the changes in the levels of Fn and CIC along with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 63 patients (31 active, 32 inactive) with BD, plasma Fn and serum CIC, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the third and fourth components of the complement system (C3, C4) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean ESR, CRP, C3 and C4 levels of active BD patients were found to be significantly higher than those of the inactive BD patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the mean Fn and CIC levels of BD patients were not significantly different from those of the healthy control group, Fn and CIC values of active BD patients were significantly lower than in the inactive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no significant correlation was observed among Fn levels and ESR, CRP, C3, C4 and CIC levels in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result of this study suggest that the variation in Fn concentration is independent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of relationship between the CIC and Fn concentrations indicates that IC deposition in the vessel wall is independent of the CIC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the exact roles of Fn and IC, further studies in tissue specimens are required </plain></SENT>
