<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEX), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (Col), and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>-alpha-dextrin (ILalphaD), during BD, on the respiratory burst of whole blood neutrophils and monocytes, CD11a/CD18 surface expression, monocyte endotoxin tolerance and cytokine synthesis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In BD patients we observed an increase of the spontaneous, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe</z:chebi>- and LPS-induced respiratory burst of monocytes and neutrophils as well as up-regulation of neutrophil CD11a/CD18 surface expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DEX, Col and ILalphaD in vitro differentially affected the stimulus-dependent oxidative burst of BD and caused the down-regulation of CD11a/CD18 surface expression in neutrophils but not monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LPS homologous tolerance induction is not altered in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, DEX and Col increased tolerance to LPS-induced TNF-alpha synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ILalphaD down-regulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe</z:chebi>- and LPS-induced oxidative burst and CD14 receptor expression and increased monocyte cross-tolerance to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DEX induced LPS-tolerance by restoring the ratio of INF-gamma and IL-4 production, while Col caused a dramatic increase in IL-4 synthesis by monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DEX, Col and ILalphaD may limit the overwhelming <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by differentially affecting the monocyte activation program, shifting them from ''classically" into "alternatively'' activated monocytes and may have important implications for the treatment of BD </plain></SENT>
