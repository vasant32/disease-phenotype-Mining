<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because there is an <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp> to trauma, particularly of the skin, in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS), an alteration in wound healing in BS is expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the healing features of punch biopsy wounds in BS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> vulgaris (AV) patients used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Full-thickness skin punch biopsies (4 mm) were taken from the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>hairless</z:mp> sites of the non-dominant forearms in 20 BS and 20 AV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient was examined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10, and the biopsy wound area and induration were marked on <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> glass slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other inflammatory changes, such as suppuration and pain, were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No antiseptic solutions or ointment, except saline, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The wound area healed similarly in both groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (65%) BS patients had erythematous haloes around the wound on the first day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of patients presenting inflammatory changes reached 18 (90%) on the second day in the BS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> around the wound in BS patients was significantly greater than that in AV patients (5; 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It gradually decreased day by day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Purulent changes were observed in four BS patients on day 1, and induration around the biopsy wound in six patients on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with AV had suppuration, which appeared on the second day, while no AV patient displayed induration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Biopsy-induced trauma may cause increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BS, but wound healing is not altered </plain></SENT>
