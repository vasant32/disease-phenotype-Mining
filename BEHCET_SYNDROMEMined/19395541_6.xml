<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: HLA-B51 is strongly associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in any ethnic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that another gene, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) is also implicated in BD in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To confirm these results, we investigated polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene in Korean patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, 119 patients with BD and 141 healthy controls were enrolled; every participant was a Korean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms previously detected in TLR4 by direct sequencing were analysed for an association with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most frequent haplotype, TAGCGGTAA, was significantly increased in HLA-B*51-positive BD patients (49.5%), compared with healthy control participants [32.3%; P = 0.029; odds ratio (OR) = 2.01; 95% CI 1.25-3.23] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This haplotype was also significantly increased in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (48.2%; P = 0.003; OR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.26-3.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of patients and controls for each single nucleotide polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The haplotype of TLR4 may increase the risk for developing BD and the complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
