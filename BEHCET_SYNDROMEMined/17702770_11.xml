<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report both the efficacy and safety of interferon-alpha-2a (IFN-alpha) therapy in corticodependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> of paediatric <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from seven children affected with corticodependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> of BD and treated with IFN-alpha were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha was injected sub-cutaneously thrice a week at dosages of 1.5-3 M(ons) IU according to the children's weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was judged on the ability of IFN-alpha to induce a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> (CS)-sparing effect while maintaining remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adverse events (AE) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The children included four boys and three girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was 8.6 yrs and mean follow-up duration was 7.14 yrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had a high level of corticodependence and five of them received additional DMARDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A remarkable CS-sparing effect with remission maintenance was achieved in 5 out of 7 patients after a mean period of 14.6 months of IFN-alpha administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remission was sustained in four of the five patients (mean = 4.8 yrs), even after IFN-alpha was discontinued in three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other patient relapsed 1.5 yrs after IFN-alpha discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The last two patients faced early severe adverse events attributed to IFN-alpha: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IFN-alpha has a potent CS-sparing effect in paediatric BD patients suffering from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility of major side-effects with this treatment calls for careful monitoring </plain></SENT>
