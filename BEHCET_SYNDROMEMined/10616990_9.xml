<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the surgical results in 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1981 and 1997, 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> secondary to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 8 men and 2 women, and their ages ranged from 33 to 60 years (mean, 46+/-8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> were aortic valve replacement in 6 patients and Bentall type operation in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient died during the hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up periods ranged from 11 to 185 months (mean, 87 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The acturial survival rate was 89% at 5 years and 67% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prosthetic valve detachment or suture detachment requiring redo operation occurred in 4 patients, 3 of whom had redo operations twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a composite graft replacement, and 1 patient died after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No prosthetic valve detachment was noted in 64% of the patients at 5 years and in 43% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of prosthetic valve detachment was 40% (4 of 10 patients), with a higher incidence in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in those treated during the same period at the same hospital for <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> caused by other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surgical techniques for treatment of this condition should be modified to improve the surgical outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
