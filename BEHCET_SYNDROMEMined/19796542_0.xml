<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:Vascular involvement (vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease) is relatively common in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>) is rare, it is the most serious and sometimes fatal complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of the development of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we carried out immunohistological examination of the ruptured pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in a patient with vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çets disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:Light microscopic examination was carried out on paraffin-embedded sections of autopsied pulmonary arteries of a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patient who died of the rupture of the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:Histopathology of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> revealed the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was proliferation of small vessels in the vascular wall, as if the recanalization was extended to the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of note, marked perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, consisting of CD45RO+ T cells and CD68+ monocytes, were observed around the recanalizing capillaries as well as around the proliferating small vessels in the wall of the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, pericapillary infiltration of CD20+ B cells was noted exclusively in the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ruptured portion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> lacks the lamina elastica, indicating that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was so called pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:It is likely that the first event might be the formation of inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the process of recanalization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, the basic inflammatory process of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease caused marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> as well as perivascular cuffing of inflammatory cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and the wall, leading to fragility of the wall </plain></SENT>
