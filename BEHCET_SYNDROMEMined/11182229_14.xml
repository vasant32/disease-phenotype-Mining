<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, HLA-B* phenotype frequencies were analyzed in 86 unrelated Moroccan patients (45 males, 41 females) and 111 ethnically matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predisposing effect of the B*51 was confirmed (30.2% in patients and 15.3% in controls, OR = 2.39, 95% CI [1.2-4.8], p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was mostly observed in males with young age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (OR= 5.5 [1.9-15.9], p = 0.002 compared to controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Moroccan BD group also presented a previously unknown association with HLA-B*15 (25.6% of patients versus 11.7% of controls, OR = 2.59 [1.2-5.5], p = 0.014), both in females and in males with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the B*15 and/or B*51 alleles were expressed in 55.8% of patients compared to 27% of controls (OR = 3.4 [1.9-6.2], p &lt; 10-4, Pc = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate HLA-B effects on BD pathogenesis should be considered separately for men and women </plain></SENT>
