<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between the types of attacks and the activities of acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the neutrophils, however, was significantly lower in the posterior type than in the anterior type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In selected cases, the time-course of the MPO activity was studied: the activity decreased at attacks and showed a recovery as the symptoms subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recovery after the attacks was faster in the anterior type than in the posterior type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference between the MPO activities in the two types of attacks was thought to be due to the fact that the posterior type attack shows more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> than the anterior type attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the MPO is released from the neutrophils just before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the ocular attacks </plain></SENT>
