<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings were studied in relation to disease activity and features of systemic vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e>, mean age of 33.56 Â± 9.7 years, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were subjected to magnetic resonance imaging with conjugate survey of cerebral blood vessels' flow pattern abnormalities by transcranial Doppler study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 66.6% with clinical features of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> had statistically significant radiographic evidences of cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> had significantly higher disease activity index score (r = 0.69, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
