<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> of which histology was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 56-year-old male came to our hospital with a complaint of right cervical pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was made by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the cardiac lesion worsened, the operation of the aortic valve replacement was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On pathological examination, there was marked fibrous thickening on the aortic valve and the rupture of elastic tissue in the media of aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no history of rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, and dilation of orifice of the aorta was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus these changes were probably due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease itself </plain></SENT>
