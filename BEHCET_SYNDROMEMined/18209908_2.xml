<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have detected the presence of anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no real evidence exists whether these antibodies exert any influence on clinical presentation and/or activity of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of AECA in patients with BD and analyze possible clinical associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 50 patients with BD who fulfilled diagnostic criteria were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients were females, and 13 were males; the mean age was 44 +/- 9 years with a mean follow-up time of 10 +/- 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AECA were assayed by ELISA using ECV-304 cells as the antigenic substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AECA was determined, and their possible relationships with present and past clinical features were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AECA were detected in the sera of 38% of the patients (IgG in 13, IgM in four, and IgG plus IgM in two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association was observed between AECA and a previous history of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement (OR= 5.4, p= 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was more evident for IgG-AECA (OR= 6.0, p= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A trend of an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was also observed in patients with IgG-AECA (OR= 2.58, p= 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the other clinical characteristics showed a relevant association with these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IgG-AECA may be a marker of more severe lesions in patients with BD based on the higher frequency of previous central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system manifestations in patients who presently display circulating AECA </plain></SENT>
