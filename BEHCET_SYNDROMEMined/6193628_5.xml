<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both groups have been compared with material from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sero-positive group comprised 13 cases of 'definite' or 'classical' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sero-negative group consisted of 9 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (3); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035012" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Reiter's syndrome</z:e> (2); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023788" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Whipple's disease</z:e> (1); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (1); Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control tissue was obtained from 6 non-arthritic subjects undergoing surgery for non-inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Confirmation was obtained of changes previously reported in subcellular organelles, especially in synovial B cells, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Attention is now drawn to other intracellular changes in B cells and intermediate cells which included: a marked increase of intermediate filaments and microfilaments: and proliferation of pinocytotic vesicles and rough endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were often accompanied by the presence, in the immediate environment of these cells, of extracellular microfibrillary masses but little or no accumulation of intermediate filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that synovial A cells were reduced in number but showed changes suggestive of increased phagocytic activity and also exhibited proliferation of cytoskeletal elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in these structural changes between sero-positive and sero-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> were of degree rather than of kind and no 'specific' or diagnostic differences were observed between the various forms of seronegative athropathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possible significance of the structural changes observed is discussed </plain></SENT>
