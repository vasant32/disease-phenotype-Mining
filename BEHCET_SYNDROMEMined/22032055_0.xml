<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The impact of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) on the vascular bed is highly important, as this condition may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> from asymptomatic systolic and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate diastolic functions using new echocardiographic parameters and the correlation of these parameters with atrial electrocardiographic (ECG) indices in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 31 patients with BD and 31 healthy control subjects were enrolled to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) diastolic functions were examined with conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P-wave dispersion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) was calculated by measuring minimum and maximum P-wave duration values on the 12-lead surface ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and echocardiographic parameters of diastolic dysfunction were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mitral inflow E/A ratio and diastolic myocardial velocity ratio (Em/Am) were lower in the BD group (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The E/Em ratio and left atrial volume index (LAVi) were higher in the BD group (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.014, respectively) compared to healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P max and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> were significantly higher in the BD group (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> correlated positively with the duration of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> correlated positively with LAVi and E/Em ratio, but negatively with E/A and Em/Am ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated that LV diastolic functions are impaired in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, P-wave abnormalities were demonstrated in BD patients and there was a significant correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
