<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study from January 1 through June 30, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were comparison of the NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-36 subscale item scores among subgroups and multivariate analysis of the NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-36 subscale item scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients rated the general health subscale score of the NEI-VFQ-25 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscale item scores of the SF-36 lower than the NEI-VFQ-25 subscales related to vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NEI-VFQ-25 subscale item scores showed significant differences with respect to age, educational level, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> activity and severity, and visual acuity in the better and worse eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SF-36 subscale item scores revealed significant differences according to sex, educational level, and the systemic treatment used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the best model of linear regression, independent variables accounted for 57.0% of the variance in the NEI-VFQ-25 subscale item (color vision subscale; adjusted R² = 0.57, P &lt; .001) and for only 23.0% of the variance in the SF-36 subscale item score (role limitation owing to emotional problems subscale; adjusted R² = 0.23, P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: General health is more affected than visual functioning in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic and clinical variables had a significant effect on vision- and health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of the NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-36 subscales revealed that each subscale item score is affected by additional factor(s) other than those analyzed here </plain></SENT>
