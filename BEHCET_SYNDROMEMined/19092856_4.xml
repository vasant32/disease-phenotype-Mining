<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV) type 1 inoculation of the earlobes of ICR mice resulted in the development of BD-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To find out whether downregulation of IL-6 would affect the symptoms of BD, IL-6 small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) was administered to a BD mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-6 siRNA was intraperitoneally injected into BD mice to downregulate IL-6 (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-6 siRNA injection downregulated serum IL-6 level (118.9+/-114.4 pg ml(-1)) compared with scramble injection (439.4+/-378.0 pg ml(-1)) in BD mice (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven out of nine IL-6 siRNA-injected BD mice, 77.8% improved and the severity score was decreased from 3.1+/-1.05 to 1.7+/-0.87 (P=0.005), whereas two out of six (33.3%) scramble-injected BD mice improved and the severity score changed from 2.5+/-0.84 to 2.0+/-1.41 (P=0.203) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Foxp3, ROR gamma t, IL-17A, IL-17F and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha were also influenced in IL-6 siRNA-injected BD mice compared with scramble-injected BD mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ cells to BD mice affected the decrease of IL-6 serum levels and were dependent on CD4+CD25+ cell numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results showed that downregulation of IL-6 improved the inflammatory symptoms in BD mice through upregulation of regulatory T cells and inhibition of Th17 cells </plain></SENT>
