<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (mean age 41.2 [30-56] years, 5 males and 12 females), as well as age- and sex-matched healthy controls, were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects satisfied the diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on the subjects was obtained through questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tests, including those for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, ear fullness, and dizziness, pure-tone audiometry, and vestibular function, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Auditory symptoms were reported by 7 (41.2%) and dizziness by 14 (82.4%) of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was present in four (23.5%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One was treated with a cochlear implantation because of bilateral sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> was detected in two (11.8%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal findings were noted in 1 (5.9%) in saccadic movement, 5 (29.4%) in the bithermal caloric tests, and 10 (58.9%) in the rotation chair tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In total, audiologic or vestibular disturbance were noted in 16 (94.1%) of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, audio-vestibular abnormalities were not noted in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Audio-vestibular disturbance is not rare in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We believe that audio-vestibular assessment and management may be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
