<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The male BD predominance is obvious in many retrospective studies and a few studies only have focused on BD in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, outcome and therapeutic data of a series of 71 female BD compared to a series of 111 male BD </plain></SENT>
