<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the determination of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity as an index of T-lymphocyte function in BD, which is known to have an T-cell-mediated immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase activities in both serum and erythrocytes were measured in 23 untreated patients with BD and in 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with BD were divided into two groups: active (n = 10) and inactive (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared with the control group, serum <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity was high (P &lt; 0.01) and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity was significantly low (P &lt; 0.01) in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity of active BD was higher than that of inactive BD (P &lt; 0.01), but erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity was found to be lower in active BD than inactive BD (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>COMMENT: These findings may provide an additional benefit for the diagnosis of BD and sub-typing of active and inactive BD </plain></SENT>
