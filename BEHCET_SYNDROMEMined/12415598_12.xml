<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied target organ associations in 272 consecutive patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of any of the clinical manifestations related to BD within the previous 3 months was sought by history questionnaire completed by a rheumatologist and by physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis was used to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four factors were identified by factor analysis of variables oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, papulopustular <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, superficial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, joint, arterial, neurological, and gastrointestinal involvement; the 4 identified factors explained 69% of the original information of the matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (Factor 1); and between superficial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (Factor 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was identified as a distinct feature, and was negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (Factor 3) only among the females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also an association between papulopustular <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and joint involvement (Factor 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors 2 and 3 had higher scores in males (p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively) versus females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We studied clinical features of BD in Turkish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4 factors we identified by factor analysis differ from a previous study from Israel, probably due to different methodologies used in the 2 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One factor described in our study, the association between papulopustular lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, supports findings of our recent study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A recognized association between superficial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was also confirmed </plain></SENT>
