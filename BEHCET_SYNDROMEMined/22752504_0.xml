<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BS patients seen at the NYU Hospital for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Joint Diseases</z:e> in the US and the Kameda Medical Center and St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Luke's International Hospital in Japan between 2003 and 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of BS was made on the basis of clinical manifestations and the clinical decisions of experienced specialists familiar with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We classified the patients into complete and incomplete types based on their symptoms; both complete or incomplete types were assumed to fulfil the Japanese criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 769 patients (US n = 634, Japan n = 135) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>61.5 % in the US and 63.7 % in Japan fulfilled the ISG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no difference in the proportions of US and Japanese patients who fulfilled the Japanese criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Japanese patients were less likely to be female and to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, but were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000031'>epididymitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> in Japan, while significantly more patients in the US received first-line <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The concordance rates for ISG and Japanese criteria fulfillment in the US and Japan were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings could help to clarify regional differences in the diagnostic and clinical features of BS </plain></SENT>
