<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined the end product of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>)) in BD patients as an index for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 37 patients (19 men, 18 women) with BD (active, n = 17; inactive, n = 20) and 20 age-matched and sex-matched healthy control subjects (11 men, nine women) included in this cross-sectional, blinded study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, sIL-2R, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were determined by a spectrophotometer technique using the immulite chemiluminescent immunometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was evaluated by Wasowicz et aL The levels of cytokines and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in the active period were compared with the inactive period of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results are expressed as mean +/- standard error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-1beta levels were below the detection limits of the assay (&lt; 5 pg/ml) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> (8.1+/-0.7 micromol/l), sIL-2R (800+/-38 U/ml), IL-6 (12.6+/-1.1 pg/ml), IL-8 (7.2+/-0.4 pg/ml), and TNF-alpha (7.9+/-0.5 pg/ml) in active BD patients were significantly higher than those in inactive patients (4.3+/-0.5 micromol/l, p &lt; 0.01; 447+/-16 U/ml, p &lt; 0.001; 8.3+/-0.6 pg/ml, p = 0.006; 5.3+/-0.1 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001; and 5.1 0.2 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001; respectively) or control subjects (2.1+/-0.2 micromol/l, p &lt; 0.001; 446+/-20 U/ml, p &lt; 0.001; 6.4+/-0.2 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001; 5.4+/-0.1 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001; and 4.7+/-0.1 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, only the mean IL-6 level was significantly different between inactive BD and control subjects (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants were significantly higher in active BD than in inactive period (for each, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: High levels of sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha indicate the activation of immune system in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serum sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha seem to be related to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation suggests <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in BD and therefore tissue damage in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Amelioration of clinical manifestations would be envisaged by targeting these cytokines, chemokines and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation with pharmacological agents </plain></SENT>
