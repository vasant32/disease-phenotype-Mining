<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, association of Th17 cells with certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> was reported, and we thus investigated circulating Th17 cells in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) CD45RO(-) (naive) T cells were cultured with Th0-, Th1-, Th2- and Th17-related cytokines and antibodies, and their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When naive CD4(+) T cells were cultured with Th1- and Th17-related cytokines, interferon (IFN)-γ <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and interleukin (IL)-17 mRNA were up-regulated, respectively, in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Naive CD4(+) T cells cultured in a Th17 cell-inducing condition expressed IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> excessively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-17 mRNA expression was induced only when naive CD4(+) T cells were cultured in the presence of IL-23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) T cells cultured with Th17 cytokines expressed excessive RAR-related orphan receptor C (RORC) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using intracellular cytokine staining, we found that CD45RO(+) (memory) CD4(+) T cells producing IL-17 and IFN-γ simultaneously were increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Memory CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-γ but not IL-17 decreased profoundly in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) T cells producing IL-17 and IFN-γ simultaneously were found in BD <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, we found excessive CD4(+) T cells producing IL-17 and IFN-γ (Th1/Th17) cells in patients with BD, and possible involvement of IL-23/IL-23R pathway for the appearance of excessive Th1/Th17 cells </plain></SENT>
