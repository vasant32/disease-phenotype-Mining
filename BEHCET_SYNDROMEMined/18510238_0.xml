<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case series of sixteen eyes of 16 patients in vitreo-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> disease associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> in a 3-year period from Mar 2002 to Jun 2005 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated with vitrectomy and the mean follow-up was (14.25 +/- 7.90) months (range: 5-32 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity in final follow-up, post-operative complications and the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 cases had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277553" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-operatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were treated with steroids for a long time and the mean treatment time was (9.94 +/- 2.67) months (range: 6-16 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative vitreo-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> complications included severe vitreous organization (5 eyes), <z:hpo ids='HP_0007917'>tractional retinal detachment</z:hpo> (6 eyes), rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (1 eye), <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhages</z:hpo> (2 eyes), epimacular membrane (2 eyes) accompanied with vitreous tissue, and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008852'>retinal neovascularization</z:mp> (16 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the post-operative period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007917'>tractional retinal detachment</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> and complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> in 3 eyes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, only 4 cases need long-term immunosuppression therapy (more than 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 16 eyes achieved a final visual acuity equal to or better than baseline (X2 = 4.923, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> was not found in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that pars plana vitrectomy may have a beneficial effect on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> which was severe or uncontrolled by immunosuppressive drugs and accompanied with vitreo-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects include improving visual acuity, reducing need for long-term immunosuppression treatment </plain></SENT>
