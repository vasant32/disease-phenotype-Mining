<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy, dose, and safety profile, including neurophysiological testing of thalidomide used in 59 patients (including 23 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease) to treat severe oral or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> (OGU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified prospectively subjects (including women of childbearing potential) who had persistent OGU over periods lasting one to 40 years and whose active ulceration was not controlled by other therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated with thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively, we identified the number of subjects with complete resolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> at one and two months of thalidomide therapy, and the dose required to maintain that improvement in those individuals who relapsed after stopping thalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease from the baseline sensory nerve action potential (baseline SNAP) amplitude value (derived from median, radial and sural nerve SNAPs) at which the development of paraesthesiae was likely to occur was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete resolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> occurred in 81% of patients within one month of thalidomide therapy at doses of 200 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No further thalidomide was required by 20% of patients responding and in the remainder improvement was maintained with smaller doses (7-200 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using an approximate 50% decrease from baseline SNAP as an indication to discontinue thalidomide, the incidence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was 13.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patients with a decrease of less than 42% developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and a further 13.5% were asymptomatic with a decrease in SNAP between 42 and 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other side effects were seen in 44% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no pregnancies and no requirement for urgent pregnancy testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide provided a useful therapeutic option in severe oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> which had not responded to other therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The physician must remain vigilant to the continuing danger of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> and teratogenesis at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times during thalidomide therapy </plain></SENT>
