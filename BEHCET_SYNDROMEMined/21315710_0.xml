<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">Lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced TNF alpha production was analyzed in the endothelial cells, Raw 264.7 cells, and serum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice after treatment with SK compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds were also orally administered to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> mouse model to investigate their anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNF alpha production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in the SK94 treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 mRNA levels were also down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 30mg/kg SK94 inhibited 55% of the TNF alpha production in LPS challenged Balb/c mice (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SK94 and SK126 were administered to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>-like mice for five consecutive days and SK94 improved in five out of six mice (83%), while it only improved in one out of nine mice (11%) in the pH 1.2 saline (artificial gastric juice) group (P&lt;0.005), four out of ten mice (40%) in the thalidomide group (P&lt;0.05), and six out of seven (86%) in the SK126 group (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Soluble ICAM-1 was inhibited by 23.8% in the sera of SK94 treated mice and by 34.6% in SK126 treated mice when compared to artificial gastric juice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, SK compounds could be candidates for clinical trials </plain></SENT>
