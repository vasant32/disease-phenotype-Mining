<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of infliximab in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and refractory bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, and to assess the proportion of relapse-free subjects through months 12 and 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Open-label, multicentre, 24-month, prospective, follow up study on 12 consecutive patients with BD and refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> who had failed at least one immunosuppressive drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline patients received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 1 mg/Kg/day with rapid tapering and nine infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) over a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-responders after the third infusion withdrew from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> degree, visual acuity (VA), number of ocular attacks and incidence of adverse events (AEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 12-month visit, 9/12 (75%) patients achieved a complete remission with no relapse during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a dramatic improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> after the first infusion, six were in complete remission after three infusions, and three after four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients suspended <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> at week 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 24-month visit, seven out of nine (78%) were still in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean VA improved from 0.2 +/- 0.6 to 0.5 +/- 0.2 (P &lt; 0.001), and ocular attacks dropped from 40 in the year before therapy to 5 after infliximab cessation (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had a partial remission with two relapses during treatment, and 2/12 (17%) patients showed no improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was well tolerated with no serious AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is rapidly effective and safe in a high proportion BD patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, and may be helpful to prevent recurrences </plain></SENT>
