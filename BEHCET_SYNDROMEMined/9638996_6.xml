<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is important in that it causes peripheral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this report, 4 patients with vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's peripheral arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were distributed in the carotid artery (n=1), popliteal artery (n=1) and femoral arteries (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative procedures included patch closure of a perforated wall for the carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, arterial reconstruction with the autogenous saphenous vein for the femoral and popliteal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients tolerated the operation well, however, two of four patients required re-operation due to anastomotic insufficiency later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease have a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in many cases and often result in rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Appropriate operative procedures, including an adequate choice of anastomotic sites and reinforcement of the suture, may reduce the incidence of complications in patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
