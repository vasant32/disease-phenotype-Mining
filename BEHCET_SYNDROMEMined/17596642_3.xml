<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed this study to evaluate the vascular changes by assessment of the arterial stiffness and intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of carotid artery in Korean patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients with BD and age-, and sex-matched 53 healthy subjects were recruited in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid arterial stiffness and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were assessed by using high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness parameters such as carotid arterial distensibility coefficient, stiffness index, and incremental elastic modulus (E(inc)) were significantly increased in BD patients compared with those in healthy subjects, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive relationship was noted between age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was significantly associated with arterial stiffness in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests impaired endothelial function before visible structural changes of arterial wall in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> may be an independent risk factor for carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and arterial stiffness, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies in more large populations are required to confirm our results </plain></SENT>
