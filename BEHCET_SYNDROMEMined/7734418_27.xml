<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motifs were obtained by pool sequencing of natural ligands eluted from the respective molecules expressed in C1R cells upon transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of individual ligands that could be sequenced confirmed the motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five HLA-B molecules belong to the HLA-B5, B35-cross-reactive group and are closely related as indicated by similar sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B51 and B52 are associated with Bw4, whereas B78 is associated with Bw6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the HLA-B molecules investigated here, HLA-B*5101, is associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, a multisystemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> affecting various organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This disease is especially frequent among the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subtle differences between the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> motifs of B*5101 as compared with the motifs of the four other closely related but not disease-associated molecules could shed light on the nature of the HLA-association of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
