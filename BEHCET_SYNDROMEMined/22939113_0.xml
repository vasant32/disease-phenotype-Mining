<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 600 patients with BD and 600 age-, sex-, and ethnically matched healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs755622 and rs2096525, were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using the chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of MIF was examined by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of SNPs in MIF with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly decreased frequencies of the rs755622 genotype GG and G allele were found in patients with BD compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the genotype TT and T allele of the SNP rs2096525 were significantly lower in patients with BD compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis showed that the frequencies of rs755622 genotype GG in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020641" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypopyon</z:e> subgroups were significantly decreased compared with controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P(c) &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower frequency of the G allele of rs755622 was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020641" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypopyon</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> subgroups compared with controls (P(c) &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the rs2096525 genotype TT and T alleles were also decreased in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020641" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypopyon</z:e>, and skin lesion subgroups compared with the controls (P(c) &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results also showed that the expression of MIF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in individuals carrying the CC genotype of rs755622 was 1.78- and 1.92-fold higher than in those carrying the GC or GG genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a strong association of the 2 SNPs, rs755622 and rs2096525, in the MIF gene with BD and suggests that the involvement of MIF in BD may be through regulation of its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
