<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether BD is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the serological markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc and anti-HCV) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> nucleic acid (HGV-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) were studied in the sera of 35 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for BD, and the results were compared with those of 36 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc in BD patients were 2.9%, 45.7%, and 31.4%, respectively, which were not significantly different from those in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the subjects in either group were found to be positive for anti-HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HGV-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was detected in two patients with BD and in none of the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, BD does not seem to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B, C, or G </plain></SENT>
