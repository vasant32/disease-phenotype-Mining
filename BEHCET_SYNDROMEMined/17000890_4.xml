<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Venous as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is a common complication of BD but exact pathogenetic mechanism of the thrombotic tendency is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate circulating activated platelets and platelet reactivity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients (4 female, 18 male; mean age 38.6 +/- 10.9 years) and 20 control subjects (8 female, 12 male; mean age 38.8 +/- 9.4 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, peripheral or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, hepatic or renal function abnormality, and who were using aspirin and other platelet-active drugs were excluded </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed markers of platelet degranulation (P-selectin; CD62P) and the activated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor (PAC1 binding to fibrinogen binding site) before and after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline (p=0.001) and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-stimulated (p=0.003) PAC1 binding was significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical activity has no effect on P-selectin expression and PAC1 binding </plain></SENT>
