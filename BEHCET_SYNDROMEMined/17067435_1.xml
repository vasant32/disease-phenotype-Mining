<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CCR5 is a Th1-dominant chemokine receptor whose levels are increased in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is believed that a 32 bp deletion in the CCR5 gene reduces the expression of this receptor on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of CCR5 delta32 allele with BD in Iranian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 100 patients with BD and 380 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used for analysis of CCR5 delta32 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of CCR5 delta32 allele was not statistically different between 100 patients with BD and 380 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, categorizing patients according to gender revealed a significant difference in distribution of the CCR5 delta32 allele in female patients compared with female control individuals (p = 0.047, fisher's exact test, OR = 2.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the CCR5 delta32 allele may be a genetic risk factor for BD in Iranian women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results warrant further investigation to clarify the underlying mechanism of CCR5 deficiency in the initiation of BD </plain></SENT>
