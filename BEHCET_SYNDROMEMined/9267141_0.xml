<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, nine patients (7 men and 2 women) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven were in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, one was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and the other was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of perfusion study were compared with the MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were as follows: 99mTc-HMPAO showed hypoperfusion of the cerebellum in 3, brain stem in 5, and cerebral cortex in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, asymmetry of the basal ganglia and thalamus was seen in 4 cases with 99mTc-HMPAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the cerebellum in 4, brain stem in 5 and cerebral cortex in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patient showed a perfusion defect with 99mTc-HMPAO that was consistent with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> shown with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> patient, perfusion defect was demonstrated with 99mTc-HMPAO, consistent with the infarction shown with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that brain perfusion scintigraphy is useful to evaluate the brain blood flow of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
