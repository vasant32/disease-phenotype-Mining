<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, little information is available on the surgical approach for arterial involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: between February 1989 and August 1997, among 178 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease referred to our clinic, vascular involvement was established in total of 67 patients (38%) which consisted of 59 venous (33%) and 12 (7%) arterial involvements requiring urgent surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary arterial lesions were occlusive in one patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation in nine or both in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: twelve primary operations and 12 reoperations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reasons for reoperations were anastomotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, graft occlusion, occlusion of native vessel, graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from anastomosis and aortoenteric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First reoperation was performed after a mean period of 6.4 months (1-15 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative follow-up was 12-60 months (mean 36 months) and three patients died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: the surgical results were not satisfactory because of progressive graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and formation of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aggressive medical treatment should be combined when major vessel involvement occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> types of arterial punctures for angiography or blood gases should be minimised because of the risk of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention is indicated only in patients with a growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rupture or severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
