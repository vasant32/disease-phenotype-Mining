<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arterial involvement is a rare but serious condition in the course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the results of therapeutic approaches in our patients with arterial lesions caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 534 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease between 1987 and 2002 were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up regularly at 3 to 6 months intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial lesions were diagnosed in 21 (3.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>), and the other 13 patients had non-pulmonary arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urgent surgical intervention was performed in three patients with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, three other patients died due to massive haemoptysis at home despite to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two out of eight patients with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> are still alive who were treated with cyclophophamide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen operations were performed in 7 out of 13 patients having non-pulmonary arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although ten of the operations were primary operations, three reoperations had to be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A stent-graft was applied for the management of an iliac artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only one patient died 8 years after the first non-pulmonary arterial involvement following a type IV thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five patients with arterial occlusive lesions were successfully treated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>Pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients have a poor prognosis despite any form of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>High dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> alone can be successfully used for isolated non-pulmonary arterial occlusive lesions, unless disabling symptoms occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgery or stent-graft insertion is indicated for non-pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> because these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> entail high risk of complications </plain></SENT>
