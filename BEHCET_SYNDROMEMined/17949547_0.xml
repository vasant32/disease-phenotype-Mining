<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further measured the SF TGF-Beta and INF-Beta levels which are known to contribute lymphoid neogenesis via leading persistent expression of CXCR4 on T cells and inhibiting T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one [15 BD, 17 RA, and 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>)] patients with at least one- sided knee <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD constituted the study group, and RA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> patients were used as positive and negative control groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SF levels of CXCL 12, CXCL 13, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi> 21, TGF-Beta and INF-Beta were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Synovial fluid <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi> 21 levels were found to be increased in RA patients as compared to BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> patients (p = 0.003, and p = 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both CXCL 12 and CXCL 13 SF levels were found to be higher in RA and BD patients as compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> patients (CXCL-12; p = 0.012, and p = 0.024), (CXCL 13; p &lt; 0.001, and p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Percentages of both CD3+CXCR4+ lymphocytes and CD3+CCR7+ lymphocytes in the SF of RA patients were detected to be increased as compared to those of BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> patients (CD3+CXCR4+; p = 0.019, p = 0.048, respectively), (CD3+CCR7+; p = 0.023, p = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, no differences with respect to the percentages of SF lymphocytes expressing CD3+CXCR4+ or CD3+CCR7+ were found between BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both TGF-Beta and INF-Beta SF levels were found to be higher in RA patients as compared to BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> patients (TGF-Beta; p = 0.041, and p = 0.003), (INF-Beta; p = 0.012, and p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
