<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">Mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">Mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs) are an essential aspect of innate immune responses that probably play an important but understudied role in cutaneous function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MBL-MASP pathway appears to exert its primary role by assisting in the clearance of apoptotic skin cells (thus preventing accumulation and a subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp>) and promoting opsonophagocytosis of invading pathogens, limiting their dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deficiencies of the pathway have been described and are associated with infectious, autoimmune and vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the role of this pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatological disease</z:e> is essentially unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe 6 patients presenting with recurrent inflammatory and/or infectious skin conditions who also demonstrated severely low MBL levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient also had a defect in the MASP2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotype analysis revealed specific point mutations in the MBL2 promoter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 patients and a variant MASP-2 gene in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients presented recurrent pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001581'>skin infections</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>cutaneous abscess</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Grover's disease</z:e> and one forme fruste of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> (orogenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients responded to antimicrobial therapy, although in some, recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It appears that MBL deficiency may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001581'>recurrent skin infections</z:hpo> and to certain forms of inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms may relate to the role of this pathway in innate immunity, removal of apoptotic cells and in immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study of MBL pathway defects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatological disease</z:e> is required </plain></SENT>
