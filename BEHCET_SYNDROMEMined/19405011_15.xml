<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although well-documented in Eastern populations, epidemiologic data is scarce in North American countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the incidence and prevalence of BD in Olmsted County, Minnesota over 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified an incidence cohort of subjects age &gt;/=18 years who had a clinical diagnosis of and/or fulfilled the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for BD from January 1, 1960 to January 1, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-specific incidence and prevalence were estimated and age- and sex-adjusted to the 2000 US total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population was comprised of 13 subjects with BD; 11 fulfilled ISG criteria between 1960 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD age was 31 +/- 9 years, and 69% were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Point prevalence in 2000 was 5.2 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.64-9.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence of BD was 0.38 per 100,000 population (95% CI 0.17-0.59), with a higher incidence in women (0.51 per 100,000; 95% CI 0.17-0.84) than in men (0.26 per 100,000; 95% CI 0.004-0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dermatologic lesions included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (100%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (62%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (46%), and papulopustular lesions (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ocular lesions, vascular complications, and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement were present in 8, 3, and 3 subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study shows an overall incidence of 0.38 per 100,000 population, which is comparable with other Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of 5.2 per 100,000 population is similar to estimates reported in Western countries, but lower than that in countries along the Silk Road </plain></SENT>
