<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Changes in concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins in the serum of patients might be significant in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report investigates the association between ocular disease activity and serum haptoglobin levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, and summarizes the current understanding of the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease based on both personal studies and data from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease with ocular involvement and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 30 patients, 14 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and 16 had inactive ocular involvement at the time of enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference in haptoglobin levels between the patients with active ocular disease and controls (p=0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant difference in haptoglobin levels between the patients with inactive ocular disease and control subjects (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed among patients with active versus inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> with regard to serum haptoglobin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum haptoglobin levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease compared to control subjects were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, elevated serum haptoglobin levels do not seem to be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is generally diagnosed by physical examinations and no laboratory marker has been widely accepted for follow-up of disease activity </plain></SENT>
