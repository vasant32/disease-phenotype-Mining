<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective clinical chart review of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who were treated with CsA or infliximab, we collected information on the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks, visual acuity and adverse side effects that occurred during the 6 months prior to and after the initiation of CsA (n=20) or infliximab (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> during the 6 months before and after initiation of CsA were 3.3+/-2.4 and 1.2+/-1.2, and those of infliximab were 3.1+/-2.7 and 0.4+/-1.0, respectively (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of episodes after infliximab administration was significantly lower than that seen for CsA (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 6-month treatment period, there were no significant differences noted in the improvement of the visual acuity between the two therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After CsA administration, neurological symptoms and renal toxicity were seen in one patient each, while after the infliximab administration, an infusion reaction and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> were seen in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During the initial 6 months of treatment, infliximab proved to be more effective in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
