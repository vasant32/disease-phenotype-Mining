<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several cases have been reported that infliximab is effective for induction of remission, the efficacy of infliximab for maintaining remission is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six cases with fulminant intestinal BD were treated with infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were steroid-dependent and refractory to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>; 3 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi>, 1 patient with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, 1 patient with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, and 1 patient with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients achieved remission by infliximab and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients maintained remission with scheduled treatments of infliximab, with the longest duration of remission being about 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another 2 patients with ileal ulceration required surgery; however, 1 patient has maintained remission by scheduled treatment of infliximab for 2 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab appears to offer an option for fulminant intestinal BD to induce and maintain remission, although a randomized control trial is needed </plain></SENT>
