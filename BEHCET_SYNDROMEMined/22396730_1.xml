<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) is a key negative regulator of T lymphocytes and polymorphisms of the PTPN22 gene have been shown to be associated with various immune-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to assess the association between PTPN22 polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in two Chinese Han populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 516 patients with ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 690 healthy controls from two Chinese Han populations were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the Ï‡(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotype frequencies were estimated through direct counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that there was no association between the tested three PTPN22 SNPs (rs2488457, rs1310182 and rs3789604) and ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Categorization analysis according to the clinical features did not show any association of these three polymorphisms with these parameters (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The investigated PTPN22 gene polymorphisms (rs2488457, rs1310182 and rs3789604) were not associated with ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in two Chinese Han populations, and showed that it may be different from other classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed to confirm these findings for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in other ethnic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
