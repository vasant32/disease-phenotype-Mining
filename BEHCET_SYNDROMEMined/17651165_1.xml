<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemostatic studies in BD support an imbalance towards a prothrombotic state at different levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) (Lp(a)) has atherogenic and thrombogenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is mostly under genetic regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible relationship between Lp(a) and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients diagnosed with BD and 40 healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very-low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, and Lp(a) levels of the two groups were assessed and compared statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (100%) had oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty (75%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, 37 (92.5%) had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum or papulopustular lesions, and 10 (25%) had eye involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve (30%) had a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four (10%) had vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Lp(a) level of the patient population was 19.6+/-18.8 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This level was higher than that of the controls, but not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Lp(a) levels of the four patients with vascular complications were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lp(a) is of interest, as it is a genetically determined parameter that was found to be high in BD patients in our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The levels were independent of thrombotic complications, perhaps suggesting a different role for this <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> in the etiopathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further studies with a larger number of patients are essential to discover the exact role of Lp(a) in BD </plain></SENT>
