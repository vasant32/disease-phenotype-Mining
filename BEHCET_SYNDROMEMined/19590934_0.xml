<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, 117 consecutive patients with BD were evaluated in their two consecutive follow-up visits by IBDDAM and BDCAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The change in disease activity was determined (increased, unchanged or decreased) according to the <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine an appropriate cutoff point for disease activity change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made by Stata and kappa analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing the area under the ROC curve showed a significant difference between IBDDAM and BDCAF (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference was more significant between nonocular IBDDAM and BDCAF (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Better concordance was also observed for IBDDAM (nonocular and total) with <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> than BDCAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference was not significant for ocular IBDDAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best cutoff point for nonocular IBDDAM was 0.45, for ocular IBDDAM was 3.5, and for BDCAF was 1 point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IBDDAM was the preferred method for the evaluation of disease activity change in patients with BD (without ocular involvement) considering a change of at least 0.45 </plain></SENT>
