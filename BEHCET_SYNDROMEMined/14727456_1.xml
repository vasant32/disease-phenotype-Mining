<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of atopy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), a Th-1 cell-mediated disease, and to investigate the clinical association between the atopy and the development of severe manifestations in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 70 consecutive BD patients and 113 controls without BD or other inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative history of severe manifestations in BD patients was investigated during the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A skin prick test was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects, and atopy was defined as present when the size of one or more allergen-induced wheals was equal to or larger than that caused by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Atopic diseases</z:e> were defined as present when there were relevant responses for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> on the questionnaires in the subjects with atopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum IgE levels and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of atopy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> was significantly lower in BD patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other atopy parameters, such as serum IgE levels and peripheral blood eosinophil counts, were also significantly lower in BD patients when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, atopy, serum IgE levels, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts did not differ significantly between BD patients with and without severe manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Th-2 cell-mediated conditions, such as atopy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e>, appeared to be lower in BD, a Th-1 cell-mediated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, a Th-1 and Th-2 balance may not influence the development of severe manifestations in BD </plain></SENT>
