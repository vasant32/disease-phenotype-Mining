<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels in active BD have not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the reliability of serum IL-6 and PCT levels as well as CRP as biological markers for activity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum PCT, IL-6 and CRP protein levels were measured in patients with active BD (n = 15) and in healthy control subjects (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-6 and PCT levels were measured in serum by chemiluminescent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a nephelometric method was used to analyse CRP concentrations in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum CRP and IL-6 values were significantly higher in the subjects with active disease than in the healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the levels of PCT in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that serum CRP and IL-6 levels are elevated in patients with active BD, but that serum PCT values are not elevated in these patients </plain></SENT>
