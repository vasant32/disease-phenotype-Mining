<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral p336-351 induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in rats which was prevented by oral tolerization with the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> linked to recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholera</z:e> toxin B subunit (CTB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This strategy was adopted in a phase I/II clinical trial by oral administration of p336-351-CTB, 3 times weekly, followed by gradual withdrawal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immunosuppressive drugs used to control the disease in 8 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were monitored by clinical and ophthalmological examination, as well as extensive immunological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of p336-351-CTB had no adverse effect and withdrawal of the immunosuppressive drugs showed no relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in 5 of 8 patients or 5 of 6 selected patients who were free of disease activity prior to initiating the tolerization regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After tolerization was discontinued, 3 of 5 patients remained free of relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> for 10-18 months after cessation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and extra-ocular manifestations of BD was associated with a lack of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation, a decrease in expression of TH1 type cells (CCR5, CXCR3), IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production, CCR7+ T cells and costimulatory molecules (CD40 and CD28), as compared with an increase in these parameters in patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> had relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of oral <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-CTB tolerization will need to be confirmed in a phase III trial, but this novel strategy in humans might be applicable generally to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> in which specific antigens have been identified </plain></SENT>
