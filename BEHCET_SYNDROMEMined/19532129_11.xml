<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: It is difficult to diagnose intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) due to various extraintestinal manifestations emerging at different time points in the disease course and a lack of reliable diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to develop and validate novel diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experts from three universities generated the preliminary diagnostic criteria for intestinal BD, and a consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method with 13 gastroenterologists participating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To validate the criteria, we recruited 12,850 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopic examinations between January 2000 and December 2006 at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The novel diagnostic criteria were developed on the basis of two aspects: colonoscopic findings and extraintestinal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 12,850 patients, 280 with ileocolonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were enrolled for validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of initial colonoscopic examinations, patients were categorized for BD status into 4 groups: definite (84 patients), probable (67), suspected (15), and nondiagnostic (114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period (mean, 50.9+/-25.7 months), intestinal BD was confirmed in 145 patients (51.8%)-84 (100%) from the definite group, 49 (73.1%) from the probable group, 10 (66.7%) from the suspected group, and 2 (1.8%) from the nondiagnostic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the diagnosis probability of these criteria were 98.6, 83.0, 86.1, 98.2, and 91.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These newly proposed, simple criteria might be useful in diagnosing intestinal BD, especially in patients with ileocolonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> who do not fully satisfy the diagnostic criteria of systemic BD </plain></SENT>
