<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surgical methods were intracapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction (ICCE), extracapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction (ECCE), ECCE + intraocular lens (ECCE + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>), and ECCE + trabeculectomy (ECCE + T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The postoperative visual prognosis was found to be significantly worse in eyes with ocular BD, than in those with IU because of the severe posterior segment complications of ocular BD, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the outcome was evaluated with regard to the individual surgical techniques, the prognosis was found to be significantly better in eyes with IU undergoing ECCE than in those with BD undergoing the same operation (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between the groups with regard to the other surgical treatment modalities (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
