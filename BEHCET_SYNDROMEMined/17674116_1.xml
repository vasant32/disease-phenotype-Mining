<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are controversial findings regarding cardiac involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although early reports demonstrated that there is diastolic dysfunction in BD, conflicting results were found in the following trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, a new method for more objectively estimating the cardiac functions is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this aim, we used high-usefulness tissue Doppler echocardiography for detailed analysis of cardiac changes in BD patients because this method was superior to other conventional echocardiographic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study population included 42 patients with BD (19 men, 23 women; mean age, 35 +/- 10 years, mean disease duration, 2.7 +/- 1.6 years) and 30 healthy subjects (14 men, 16 women; mean age, 38 +/- 7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac functions were determined using echocardiography, comprising standard two-dimensional and conventional Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic myocardial velocity at mitral annulus, early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Em), late diastolic mitral annular velocity (Am), Em/Am, and myocardial performance index (MPI) were calculated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conventional echocardiographic parameters and tissue Doppler measurements were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tissue Doppler derived mitral relaxation time was longer (75 +/- 13 vs 63 +/- 16 msn, p = 0.021) in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding left ventricular MPI (0.458 +/- 0.072 vs 0.416 +/- 0.068%, p = 0.016), which were calculated from tissue Doppler systolic time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was also significant correlation between the disease duration and MPI (r = 0.38, p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that tissue Doppler-derived myocardial left ventricular relaxation time and MPI were impaired in BD patients, although systolic and diastolic function parameters were comparable in the patients and controls </plain></SENT>
