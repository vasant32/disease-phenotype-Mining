<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The choice of the stimulus and test assay is of utmost importance in discriminating patients at risk for persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and in identifying acquired or genetic abnormalities of t-PA synthesis or release from endothelial cells in pathologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to compare the efficacy and reproducibility of the fibrinolytic response to desmopressin <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (deamino-8-D-argininevasopressin) (DDAVP) by use of various routes of administration with the response to the venous occlusion test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine healthy male volunteers were randomly administered intravenous desmopressin <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, intranasal drops and intranasal spray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from tests of euglobulin lysis time, t-PA activity, t-PA antigen levels, and t-PA fast-acting inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI]) level were compared with those obtained after venous occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only test that elicited the release of free t-PA activity in the circulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volunteers was the intravenous administration of 0.4 microgram/kg desmopressin <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, and the most reliable test assay was t-PA activity measured in the euglobulin fraction of plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous desmopressin <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> induced the release of large amounts of t-PA in most cases and caused a significant fall in PAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other routes of administration of desmopressin <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, along with venous occlusion, identified many nonresponders who proved to be false negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relevance of these data was demonstrated in a study in nine patients with thromboembolic phenomenon or related disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
