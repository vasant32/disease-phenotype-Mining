<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not yet clear which factors are involved in the proposed Th1 mediated pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen presenting cells which play a crucial role in the polarization of immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No previous study has examined the possible role of DCs in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted both quantitative and functional analysis of the peripheral blood DC subsets in BD patients with different clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with BD, 12 healthy controls (HC), and 12 patients with undifferentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spondylarthritis</z:e> (uSpA) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood DC subsets were analysed by flow cytometry and were further characterized for maturation with CCR7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-b were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BD patients had a decreased percentage of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) compared to HC (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha levels were found to be increased in BD patients as compared to HC and uSPA (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BD patients had decreased levels of IFN-Beta as compared to HC and uSpA (p = 0.013, p = 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between HC and patients with uSpA regarding IFN-Beta levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis of BD patients disclosed normalization of percentage of pDCs and the level of IFN-Beta in patients receiving IFN-alpha-2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest abnormalities in pDCs and type I IFNs appear to be a master switch leading to the pathogenicity in BD by directing immune response towards Th1 </plain></SENT>
