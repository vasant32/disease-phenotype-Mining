<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the distribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related gene A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>) transmembrane alleles among 58 Spanish patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and in 194 ethnically matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included the characterization of A4, A5, A5.1, A6 "new" and "old" and A9 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM alleles using polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, the serological B51 specificity was increased among this BD patient group (36.25% vs. 19.6% in controls; P=0.009; OR=2.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM alleles A6 ("new" and "old"), in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51 and HLA-B14 respectively, were only slightly increased among patients (70.7% vs. 61.3% in controls; P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in contrast to previous finding reporting a strong association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM genes and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease in Japanese patients, in our population HLA-B51 is more closely associated to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet susceptibility than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, our data show that in Spain, as occurs in other populations, some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM alleles exhibit strong linkage disequilibrium with certain alleles of the HLA-B locus </plain></SENT>
