<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reported 157 consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>) fulfilling the international criteria for BD and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (0.5-1 mg/kg/day) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (2.5 mg/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome and factors associated with complete remission were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean±SD age at diagnosis was 29.9±10.1 years, with 71.3% men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 59 patients (37.6%) had loss of useful vision, 54 (34.4%) had <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, 66 (42.0%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>, and 132 (84.1%) had bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> therapy, 81 patients (51.6%) were complete responders, 65 (41.4%) were partial responders, and 11 (7%) were nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity significantly improved (P&lt;0.001), and a significant decrease in the mean oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dosage (55.3 to 10.5 mg/day; P&lt;0.001) was observed after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 0.45 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.2-0.9], P=0.02) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> (OR 0.28 [95% CI 0.2-0.7], P&lt;0.0001) at diagnosis were less likely to be complete responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi> was well tolerated, with only 3 withdrawals due to hepatotoxic effects (n=2) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi> represents an effective and safe therapy in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> of BD </plain></SENT>
