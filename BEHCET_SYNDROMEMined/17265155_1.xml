<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a continuation of our previous studies, we investigated synovial levels of angiostatic non-ELR CXC chemokines (CXCL4, CXCL9 and CXCL10) in patients with RA, BD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spondyloarthritis</z:e> (SpA), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy (17 RA, 15 BD, 19 SpA, and 19 OA) patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of CXCL4, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SF levels of CXCL4 in patients with RA were higher than those of the patients with BD, SpA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (P = 0.007, P = 0.022, and P = 0.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was found with respect to CXCL4 levels among the BD, SpA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The synovial CXCL9 levels of patients with RA and SpA were found to be higher than those of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (P = 0.002 and P = 0.005, respectively), while no statistically significant difference was detected among the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to SF CXCL10 levels, patients with RA had higher levels as compared to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (P = 0.002), but no significant difference was found among the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CXCL9 correlated with CXCL4 and CXCL10 (P &lt; 0.05 for both) in patients with RA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We proposed that angiostatic non-ELR CXC chemokines may increase to balance angiogenic ELR (+) CXC chemokines in which increased levels were shown in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory arthritides</z:e> and CXCL4 may contribute to designate the chronicity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> in patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, as CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 play crucial role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> characterized by Th1 polarization, we suggested that they may contribute to the commencement and the perpetuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> seen in these groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arthritides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
