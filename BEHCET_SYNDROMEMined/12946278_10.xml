<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha is believed to play a pivotal role in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic blockade of the activity of TNF has been successfully given in a short course of therapy with favorable effects in patients with BD refractory to conventional immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to find out whether a 12-month treatment with infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, had any beneficial effect in reducing relapses of a patient with long-standing BD refractory to conventional immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 54 year-old-woman with a 35-year history of BD with orogenital ulcerations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> in the right knee and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> received infliximab, 5 mg/kg by a two-hour intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms improved within 24 hours and eight days later the genital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> healed as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> in the right knee subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infiltrates completely resolved within 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infusions were repeated at weeks 2, 6, 14, 22 and then every 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was able to return to her domestic daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No exacerbation of the mucocutaneous ocular or arthritic symptoms occurred during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have suggested that infliximab given in a short course of treatment is effective in inducing remission of severe mucocutaneous, gastrointestinal and ocular manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our patient received a 12-month infliximab treatment showing a favorable effect on remission of BD manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The long-term infliximab treatment appears as a new therapeutic option for patients with active BD who failed to respond to conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
