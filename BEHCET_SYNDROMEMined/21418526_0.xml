<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of the IL-1 cluster gene polymorphisms with the development of BD was investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were obtained from a Turkish population of 97 patients with BD, and 77 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genotyping (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1R and IL-1Ra) experiments were performed using sequence specific primers PCR (PCR-SSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared to the healthy controls, the frequencies of IL-1Ra IL-1α and IL-1R gene polymorphisms were not significantly different in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IL-1β-511 TT genotype was higher in the BD group in comparison to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we demonstrated that IL-1 β +3962 gene polymorphism seems to be associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>Erythema</z:hpo> nodosum in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that polymorphisms in IL-1β gene may affect host susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to confirm the biological significance of our results, further studies should be performed in a large-scale study and/or in different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
