<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cultivable <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> compositions from periodontal sites and saliva were examined by anaerobic culture using blood agar plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> anaerobic rods such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Capnocytophaga species were predominant in the isolates from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0399451" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subgingival plaque</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Streptococcus mitis group was the most common type isolated from the saliva samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To detect the production of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>, Western blot analyses were performed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody to Escherichia coli DnaK and a monoclonal antibody to Helicobacter pylori <z:chebi fb="94" ids="17754">Gro</z:chebi>-EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sonic extracts of 27 of the strains (79.4%) reacted with the antibody against E. coli DnaK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of these 34 strains (26.5%) were found to produce <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> that reacted with antibody to H. pylori <z:chebi fb="94" ids="17754">Gro</z:chebi>-EL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 54 isolates were examined for superantigen activity against human peripheral leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>gram-negative</z:mp> clinical strains isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> lesions and 20 ATCC strains of microorganisms were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We could not detect any superantigen activity in 500x diluted supernatant of the strains isolated from the eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that the anaerobic strains isolated from the oral cavity of these patients produce <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>, the production being related to Bechet's disease </plain></SENT>
