<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (MD) on the QoL of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: BD outpatients (n=25) and psychiatric outpatients (n=25) with only MD among the Axis I <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo>, and BD outpatients (n=25) and healthy controls (n=25) without any Axis I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric disorder</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Structured Clinical Interview for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>-I) was used to determine Axis I <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and QoL levels were assessed with the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI) and the World Health Organization QoL Assessment-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference with regard to demographic characteristics between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Psychiatric and BD patients with MD had significantly lower overall WHOQOL-BREF subscale scores than BD patients without MD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in terms of QoL between the groups of psychiatric and BD patients with MD, nor between the groups of BD patients without MD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a significantly negative correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> WHOQOL-BREF subscale and BDI scores in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study suggests that concurrent MD has a negative impact on QoL of BD patients and that QoL is negatively correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
