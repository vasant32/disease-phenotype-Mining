<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin class of circulating immune complexes (IC) was examined in 35 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) according to the HLA phenotype of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cold precipitable complexes were separated and assayed by laser nephelometry and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> precipitable complexes were assayed by rocker immuno-electrophoresis for IgG, IgA and C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in patients with BS, HLA-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> is associated with an increased proportion of IgG and a decreased proportion of IgA and C3 in their immune complexes, whilst the converse was found with HLA-B5 or DRw2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of IgA:IgG in immune complexes was therefore low in patients with HLA-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> but high in those with HLA-B5 or DRw2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a linkage may exist between HLA and gene(s) determining the immunoglobulin class, in response to antigenic stimulation or the site of antigen localization </plain></SENT>
