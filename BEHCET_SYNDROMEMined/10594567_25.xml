<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to characterize the activation stage and cytokine profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), with particular emphasis on gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venous blood was collected from 20 patients with BD, and for comparison, from 11 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and from 15 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the expression of activation markers (CD25, CD29, CD40 ligand, CD69 and HLA-DR) on freshly isolated PBL and T cell subsets, and the expression of intracellular cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated PBL and T cell subsets were analysed by double immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly decreased proportion of alphabeta T cells and increased proportion of gammadelta T cells, CD56+ cells and CD8+ gammadelta T cells were found in BD patients compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was also seen to a lesser extent in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in BD a significantly increased proportion of the gammadelta T cell population expressed CD69 and high levels of CD29 and were induced to produce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an increased percentage of gammadelta T cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients was induced to produce IFN-gamma, but not TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in BD, activated gammadelta T cells, capable of producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, are present in peripheral blood, suggesting that gammadelta T cells are dynamic and may be regulating immunopathogenic events </plain></SENT>
