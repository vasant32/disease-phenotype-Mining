<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 18 families with 40 affected members in two successive generations were evaluated by interviewing them for their ages at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the first symptom of BS and for their ages at the time they fulfilled the diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was noted that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of the first symptom was lower in the second generation in 14 families (p = 0.01) with a mean (SD) age of 20.57 (7.47) years in the children compared with 33.29 (9.92) years in the parents (t = 7.79, p &lt; 0.0001), whereas the diagnostic criteria were fulfilled at an earlier age in the children in 15 families (p = 0.01) with a mean age of 21.2 (6.74) years in the children compared with 36.4 (9.55) years in the parents (t = 7.41, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003743'>Genetic anticipation</z:hpo> was present in 15 of 18 (84%) of the families with BS in the form of earlier disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the children compared with their parents </plain></SENT>
