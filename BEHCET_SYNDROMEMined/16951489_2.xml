<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MEFV gene, which is the main factor in familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>), is also reported to be a susceptibility gene for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pyrin domain of MEFV gene is a member of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-domain superfamily and has been proposed to regulate inflammatory signaling in myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine if mutations in pyrin domain of MEFV gene are involved in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the pyrin domain of MEFV gene in 54 Turkish patients with BD by PCR-analysis and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither deletion or insertion mutations nor point mutations in pyrin domain were found in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although pyrin gene mutations have been reported in patients with BD, pyrin domain is not mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, alterations in other regions of MEFV gene and interaction between pyrin domains are needed to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
