<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, prevalence, role of surgical intervention and the visual prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011508'>macular holes</z:hpo> (MH) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with BD and MH from January 1998 to November 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 159 patients, 21 eyes of 17 patients were identified with MH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 38.59 (range 23-61) years and the mean follow-up period was 5.1 years (range 13-164 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MH was 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity (VA) at the time of presentation ranged from 20/70 to hand-motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings revealed intraretinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> at the edge of the MH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean size of MH was 983.6 um; 52% had elevated edges, 43% had flat edges and only <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> (5%) was closed postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography (FA) was consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macular ischemia</z:e> in 76% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B51 association was found in 14 of the 15 patients investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients (out of 17) underwent pars plana vitrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The final VA on their last follow-up ranged from 20/70 to 2/200 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention for MH did not result in any visual improvement as compared to non-operated eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient lost vision completely due to elevated intraocular pressure post vitrectomy and silicon oil tamponade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MH in patients with BD may lead to significant visual disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention does not seem to have any potential beneficial effect on the VA, probably due to significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macular ischemia</z:e> and sequelae from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
