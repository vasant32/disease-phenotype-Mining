<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells have been shown to express chemokines that are involved in inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated serum IL-8 levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured serum IL-8 levels in 21 patients with BD and 16 with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from 30 age-matched healthy blood donors were used as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-8 levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean serum IL-8 level of the active BD (1522.31 pg/ml) and that of the active <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> (654.8 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (40.39 pg/ml, P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in mean serum IL-8 levels between patients with inactive disease and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found higher serum levels of IL-8 in those patients with more severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IL-8 may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> and/or BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study also suggests a possible relation between serum IL-8 levels and the severity of these diseases </plain></SENT>
