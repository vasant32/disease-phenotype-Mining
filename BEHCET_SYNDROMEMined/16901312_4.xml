<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 83 patients with BD, 95 ethnically matched healthy controls, 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) and 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) by restriction fragment length polymorphism after PCR amplification of the genomic region encompassing the polymorphic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the TLR2 Arg753Gln A allele and A/G genotype frequencies did not show a significant difference between patients with BD and healthy controls (1.2% vs. 0.6%, and 2.1% vs. 1.1%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients from the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and RA groups had the A allele or A/G genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the TLR2 Arg753Gln polymorphism does not play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
