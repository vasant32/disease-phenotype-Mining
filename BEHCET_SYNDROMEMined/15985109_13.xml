<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with BS may present with different neurological problems, related either directly or indirectly to the disease, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> being the most common neurological symptom seen in this syndrome, as well as independent from neurologic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This study was carried out at the multidisciplinary <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet outpatient clinic of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Syndrome Research Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Every fifth admitted patient who had fulfilled the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease classification criteria was recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient was interviewed by one of the examining neurologists through a semistructured questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case of the presence of more than one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> type, the best defined one was diagnosed and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a complete neurological and physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A chi(2) test was used to evaluate the differences between frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One sample t-test was used to compare means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were compared with results of the Turkish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Epidemiology study by using goodness-of-fit test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was reported in 66.2% (151/228) of the study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were seen in 38.6% of the patient population, which corresponds to 58% of BS patients with any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (TTHA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> were seen in 23.6% and 14.9% of the whole study cohort, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 5.2% of the study cohort, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was associated with neurological involvement and in 3.9% to uveal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A predominantly frontal, bilateral paroxysmal throbbing pain of moderate severity was reported in 18.4% of the study cohort who did not fulfill the criteria of the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Society (IHS) for any of the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It was commonly associated with exacerbations of the mucocutaneous symptoms of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The neurological examination was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was categorized as the nonstructural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> is the most common neurological symptom seen in BS, both in patients with and without neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The results of our study reveal that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is seen in a majority of patients with neurological involvement due to BS and in a minority with uveal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and TTHA are close to the population in general, but a nonstructural migrainous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, which is commonly associated with exacerbations with some of the systemic symptoms of the syndrome, is noteworthy in patients with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is not specific for this disorder, but may be explained by a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> triggered by the immunomediated disease activity in susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
