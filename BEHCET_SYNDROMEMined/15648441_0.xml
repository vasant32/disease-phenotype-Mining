<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunologic basis for the therapeutic action of CsA depends on the suppression of lymphokine production by T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to its immunologic effects, this drug is also commonly preferred in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, especially with neurologic and ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the course of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease presents remissions and exacerbations, drug therapy should be long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies on the safety of long-term use of CsA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatologic diseases</z:e> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the long-term use of CsA in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>,et's disease without renal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 19 patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>,et's disease receiving CsA therapy for at least 1 year were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in the parameters of renal function (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level in serum), other adverse effects and their relation with cumulative CsA dosage were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of CsA therapy and total dosage were not found to have a significant effect on the parameters of renal function, but, depending on clinical observations, the adverse effects seem to increase in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that our results on renal function should be supported by renal biopsies </plain></SENT>
