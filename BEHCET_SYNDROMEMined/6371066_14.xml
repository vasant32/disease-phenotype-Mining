<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients meeting rigorous clinical criteria were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one patient showed evidence of immune regulatory dysfunction (increased T4/T8 ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although C1q binding and Raji cell assays for CIC yielded positive results in only one of five patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients had in vivo "<z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> trap test" evidence of CIC (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome patients increased migration of neutrophils to zymosan-activated serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> therapy abolished the enhancing effect of the patient's sera on movement of PMN cells from patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An immune complex-mediated injury that is followed by an excessive accumulation of PMN cells may lead to the cutaneous lesions and other lesions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> therapy is warranted on the basis of these studies </plain></SENT>
