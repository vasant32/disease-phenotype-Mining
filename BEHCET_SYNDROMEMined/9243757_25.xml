<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a Greek population, an increased incidence of HLA-B5 in the patient group has also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the B51 antigen has been recently identified to comprise seven alleles, B*5101-B*5107, we performed HLA-B51 allele genotyping by the PCR-SSP method as well as serological HLA-A and -B typing among 31 Greek patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease to investigate whether there is any correlation between one particular B51-associated allele and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of B51 was remarkably high (80.6%) in the patient group as compared to the ethnically matched control group (26.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA-A26 was also increased in the patients (29.0%) as compared with the healthy controls (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B51 allele genotyping revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these B51-positive patients carried B*5101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study revealed a strong association of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Greeks with one of the B51 subantigens, providing insight into the molecular mechanism underlying an HLA association with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
