<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), is a multisystem pathology, and survival is related to pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it appears that different treatments correlate with different prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and tomographic evolution, as well as the survival, of patients with BD-related pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of our experience with pulmonary manifestations in patients with BD treated at our institution between January 1, 1988 and April 30, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical, radiological, treatment and survival data were obtained from medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 9 patients with BD-related pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 34 +/- 11.5 years, and 7 of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The radiological findings were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>) in 8 patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in 3 (translating to an incidence of 5.11 cases/100 patient-years); <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> in one; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment consisted of immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> (or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with partial or complete resolution of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> also received sildenafil and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, with good clinical and tomographic response (the first report in the English literature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our sample, the mean duration of the follow-up period was 6.52 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The three-year survival rate was 88.8%, as was the five-year survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BD-related pulmonary involvement can present good survival with immunosuppressive therapy, and BD should be borne in mind as a possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
