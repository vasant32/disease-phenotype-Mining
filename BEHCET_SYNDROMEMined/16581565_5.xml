<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is disagreement as to whether they should be used as a diagnostic criterion in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the histopathologic evaluation of the papulopustular lesions may assist in the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with BD and 16 control patients consisting of eleven patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> and five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> vulgaris were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the detailed histopathologic evaluation by two pathologists who were blinded to the clinical diagnoses, the histopathologic findings were classified into three patterns as follows; pattern I: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (lymphocytic or leucocytoclastic); pattern II: <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263006" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">perifolliculitis</z:e>; pattern III: superficial and/or deep perivascular, and/or interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, direct immunofluorescence studies were performed in order to evaluate the deposition of IgM, IgG, IgA, C3, or fibrinogen in dermal blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>27.8% of the patients with BD (5 patients) revealed lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, while none of the control group did; and the difference was found statistically significant (P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of pattern II which included <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263006" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">perifolliculitis</z:e> was 50.0% in control patients and 16.7% in the patients with BD; and the difference was found statistically significant (P=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between the two groups with regard to pattern III or direct immunofluorescence findings (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that only vasculitic changes can be useful when histopathological features of papulopustular lesions are to be employed as a diagnostic criterion in patients with suspected BD </plain></SENT>
