<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the distribution of TNF-alpha promoter -1031T/C and -308G/A polymorphisms in 53 BD patients of Iranian Azeri Turks and 79 matched healthy controls, via the PCR-RFLP technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the TNF-alpha -1031C allele was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients than in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.0001, OR = 3.08; 95% CI = 1.73-5.47), whereas the frequency of the TNF-alpha -308A allele was similar in the two compared groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of CG haplotype was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.0001, OR = 3.42; 95% CI = 1.89-6.18), and that of the TA haplotype was significantly lower in BD patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TNF-alpha is a susceptibility gene for BD in patients from Iranian Azeri Turk ethnic group </plain></SENT>
