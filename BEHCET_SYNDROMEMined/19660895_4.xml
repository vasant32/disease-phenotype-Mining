<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and outcome of endovascular therapy combined with immunosuppressive therapy for aortic pseudoaneurysms in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2002 and April 2008, 12 pseudoaneurysms (9 involving the intrarenal abdominal aorta, 1 at the suprarenal level, and 2 in the supraceliac aorta) in nine men and one woman with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were evaluated at Peking Union Medical Center (PUMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three bifurcated stent grafts and seven tubular stent grafts, including two fenestrated stent grafts, were deployed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients received immunosuppressive therapy after the implant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent successful endovascular therapy without major complications during the 30 days immediately after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had treatment of only the larger infrarenal symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, but the smaller suprarenal pseudoaneurysm was not addressed because of its proximity to mesenteric branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 25.8 months (range, 6-50 months), nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> resolved completely in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, which coexisted with a treated lesion, remained stable under imaging observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> recurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, one patient presented with a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the femoral artery access site for stent graft introduction and another formed at the proximal margin of the stent graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite medical advice, he had stopped immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>He died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture 8 months after stent deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Another patient with recurrent aneurysmal disease at the distal margin of the primary stent was successfully treated with an additional stent graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These two were the only patients who did not adhere to taking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> medicine after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular stent graft placement combined with immunosuppressive treatment for aortic pseudoaneurysms in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is a feasible and effective management option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Long-term immunosuppressive therapy after endovascular repair is important to limit pseudoaneurysm recurrence </plain></SENT>
