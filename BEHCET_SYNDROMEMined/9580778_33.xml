<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical picture of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire was completed by five BD specialists from Turkey, France, Iran, or Saudi Arabia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We first reviewed 86 cases retrospectively with a specially designed computerized database and then selected 65 who met the criteria of the International Study Group for BD, which include buccal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> plus at least two among recurrent genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e>, eye lesions, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, and positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 21 patients, who had features suggestive of BD but did not fulfill the international criteria, were analyzed separately and then compared with the other 65 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BD affected boys and girls equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture frequently included mucocutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was less frequent than in adults but carried a poor prognosis, especially in male patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate (3%) was related to large vessel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Familial cases were particularly frequent (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>Erythema</z:hpo> nodosum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585186" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin hypersensitivity</z:e> were common in Turkish patients, whereas neuro-BD was more frequent in French and Saudi Arabian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who did not fulfill the international criteria had significantly less genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01), less <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> or hypersensitivity (p &lt; 0.01), and less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BD in children is similar to BD in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of familial cases calls for further investigation of the immunogenetic factors that may favor early expression of the disease </plain></SENT>
