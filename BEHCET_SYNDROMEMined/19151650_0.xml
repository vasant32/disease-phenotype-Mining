<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To characterize the disease course and visual outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in juvenile <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) compared with adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 13 children (mean age 14+/-2.4 years; 22 eyes) and 16 adults (mean age 30+/-8.8 years; 27 eyes) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD diagnosed between 1997 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.6:1 in the paediatric group and 3:1 in the adult group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five children (38%) and four adults (25%) had complete BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of follow-up for both groups was 4.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The children had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations (4.1+/-2.7 vs2.3+/-1.5, P=0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment in both groups included systemic steroids and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In children, mean initial visual acuity in the affected eyes (n=22) was 0.6+/-0.7 logMAR (range, 0-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It decreased during exacerbations in 15 eyes (68%; mean, 1.6+/-0.8 logMAR), severely reduced (worse than 1 logMAR) in 11 eyes (50%; mean, 2.0+/-0.45 logMAR), and improved significantly in 12 of 13 promptly treated eyes (92%; 6/12 or better in 11; mean 0.2+/-0.4 logMAR, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The visual outcome pattern was similar in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> in juvenile BD is characterized by frequent exacerbations of explosive nature with profoundly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar disease pattern was observed in children and adults, as well as in patients with complete or incomplete disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis, even before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> systemic criteria are fulfilled, is important because early aggressive therapy can achieve long-term useful visual acuity </plain></SENT>
