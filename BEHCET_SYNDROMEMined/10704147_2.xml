<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eyes, skin, joints, the oral cavity, genital system, blood vessels, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and lung are usually involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Defective regulation of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) may play a role in the development of (BD), and the proto-oncogene Bcl-2 is involved in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in immunocompetent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore wished to investigate the expression of Bcl-2 in the peripheral lymphocytes and in two inflammatory sites of patients with active BD: bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of Bcl-2 expression in the lymphocytes of patients with BD and, for comparison, in the lymphocytes of healthy controls and non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (NIND), were studied by two-colour cytofluorography and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BD patients, a significant proportion of T cells expressed increased amounts of Bcl-2 protein, both in peripheral blood and in inflammatory sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells of patients with BD showed increased amount of Bcl-2 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro incubation of T lymphocytes with IL-10, significantly increased the Bcl-2 expression, specifically in T lymphocytes from inflammatory sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In active BD, stimulation of HSV-1 T lymphocytes slightly increased Bcl-2 expression, not significantly different from unstimulated HSV-1 T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of circulating T lymphocytes with abnormally high Bcl-2 expression in peripheral circulation and in inflammatory sites may be explained in part by the increased in vivo activation levels, and by aetiopathological agent(s): our findings seem to indicate an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
