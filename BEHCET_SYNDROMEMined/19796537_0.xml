<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiopathogenesis of BD has not yet been identified; but it has generally been accepted that several environmental factors may induce an inflammatory attack in genetically susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to identify antigens that could elicit high-titer IgG responses by the serological analysis of recombinant expression of cDNA libraries method (SEREX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened a human testis cDNA library with pooled sera obtained from 4 BD patients by SEREX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antigens that were identified with the initial analysis were selected for seroreactivity analysis of a larger group of BD patients (n=78) and controls (n=66) by serological immunoscreening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed seroreactivity against 6 antigens using the pooled sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included rabaptin 5 (RABPT5), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), switch associated protein 70 (SWAP70), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), ankyrin repeat domain 20 family, member A1 (ANKRD20A1), and an unknown antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of 82 (13.4%) BD patients were found to have antibodies elicited against PINK1 antigen, when none of the control sera showed reactivity (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the frequency of other defined antigens between the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, among BD clinical sub-groups, anti-SWAP70 antibodies were found to associate with vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In this study, antibodies against PINK1 were found to specifically associate with BD while SWAP70 antibody was associated with clinical sub-groups of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although variations in both genetic background and environmental factors may affect the outcome of serological responses, our results suggest that serological screening can be used to identify antigens that elicit antibody responses associated with BD </plain></SENT>
