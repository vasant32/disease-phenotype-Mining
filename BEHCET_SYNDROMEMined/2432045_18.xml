<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of HLA-B51 (p less than 0.00001) and DRw52 (p = 0.045) with no significant difference between complete and incomplete syndrome was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The involvement of B51 antigen as the main immunogenetic factor in the disease is suggested by the high value of relative risk (RR = 16.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the association with the II class antigen DRw52 (RR = 2.77) cannot be easily explained as a secondary association due to linkage disequilibria with B51 </plain></SENT>
