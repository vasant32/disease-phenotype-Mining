<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is not associated with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>laboratory abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, the activity of BD is generally assessed by clinical findings and--to some extent--by nonspecific markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to investigate the relative efficiency of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serumamyloid A protein (SAA), and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) levels as markers of disease activity in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 20 patients with active BD, 23 patients with inactive BD, and 27 healthy adults serving as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum beta 2-m, SAA, ESR, and CRP levels of patients with BD were found to be significantly higher than those in the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were also higher in patients with active disease than in those in remission and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ESR, and CRP in inactive patients were also significantly higher than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was noted between beta 2-m levels of patients with inactive BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum beta 2-m levels can beregarded as a more discriminative marker of activation in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high diagnostic value of SAA levels indicate that it can also be accepted as a marker of disease activity in BD </plain></SENT>
