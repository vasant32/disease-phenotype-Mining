<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients referred for neurological evaluation fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed disability and survival by the Kaplan-Meier method, using Kurtzke's Extended Disability Status Scale (modified for BD) and the prognostic effect of demographic and clinical factors by Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 164 patients; of the 107 diagnostic neuroimaging studies: 72.1% showed parenchymal involvement, 11.7% venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (VST) and the others were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF studies were performed in 47 patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with inflammatory CSF findings (n = 18) had parenchymal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An isolated increase in pressure was compatible with either VST or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final diagnoses were VST (12.2%), neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>) (75.6%), isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> (0.6%), psycho-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome (0.6%), and indefinite (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VST and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> were never diagnosed together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten years from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BD 45.1% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>) reached a disability level of EDSS 6 or higher, and 95.7 +/- 2.1% of the patients were still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Having accompanying cerebellar symptoms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or a progressive course is unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or a diagnosis of VST is favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two major neurological diagnoses in BD are <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> and VST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These are distinct in clinical, radiological, and prognostic aspects, hence suggesting a difference in pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
