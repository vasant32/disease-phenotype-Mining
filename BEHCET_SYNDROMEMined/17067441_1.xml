<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: [corrected] To determine the clinical characteristics of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)-associated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 54 Japanese cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated BD obtained from the literature and from our own clinical experience were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated BD were compared with those of the 1991 nationwide BD survey in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated BD, the average age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 42.6 years, which was 6.9 years later than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BD patients; females developed disease more frequently than males (male: female ratio = 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated BD cases, the occurrence of eye lesions was significantly lower, the frequency of intestinal lesions was markedly higher, and the rate of HLA-B51 positivity was lower than that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> developed nearly simultaneously in 49.0% of cases; BD preceded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in 31.4% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the age at BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed two peaks, one in the 3rd decade and the other in the 6th decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Females were more likely to develop younger-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> disease, while men were more likely to develop older-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the older-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group, BD was diagnosed together with or after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, while half of the younger-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group developed BD earlier than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated BD patients form a distinct subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There may, in fact, be two major groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-associated BD patients based on age, gender, and temporal relationship of the two diseases </plain></SENT>
