<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fibrinolytic activity was studied in seven patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and 12 patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had significantly reduced resting tissue plasminogen activator(t-PA) both by euglobulin fibrin plate lysis and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but the tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor(t-PAI) was not significantly different from the control value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After stimulation by venous occlusion the euglobulin fibrin plate lysis results showed three good responders and four poor responders, but neither t-PA antigen nor t-PAI concentrations showed any clear difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, three out of the four patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were good responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> showed no significant difference from the controls for any of these measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the reduced resting fibrinolytic activity is usually due to decreased production of t-PA, but that the defective response to stimulation may be multifactorial in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fibrinolytic abnormalities appear unrelated to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
