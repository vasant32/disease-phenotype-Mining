<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally explained by an increase in the inhibitory potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to prove this theory, the fibrinolytic system was investigated in 5 male patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By the venous occlusion test, a marked suppression of the activatability of the system could be demonstrated (euglobulin lysis time, various fibrin plate assays) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of analysis of the known inhibitors could not explain the phenomenon: antithrombin III, alpha2-macroglobulin, fast-reacting alpha2-antiplasmin, C1 inactivator, and the plasmin-antiplasmin complex were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only change was an elevation of alpha1-antitrypsin and fibrinogen in 4 patients possibly due to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the possibility of a hitherto unidentified inhibitor, therefore, a decrease in production or in release of vessel wall activators must also be considered in the pathogenesis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
