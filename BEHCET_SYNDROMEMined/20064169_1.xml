<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are few published clinical trials concerning upper gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), and most have been performed on patients with upper GI tract symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We sought to determine whether routine endoscopy is indicated in asymptomatic patients with BD and whether Helicobacter pylori plays a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with BD and 40 age- and gender-matched controls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040259" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tinea pedis</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent fiberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">Urea</z:chebi> breath test was used to identify H. pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormalities were noted in 37 patients (93%): <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> (53%), antral <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (33%), pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (23%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038358" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric ulceration</z:e> (8%), and duodenal ulceration (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Helicobacter pylori was found in 26 patients (65%) with BD and in 28 controls (70%) (no significant difference by chi-squared test, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a high incidence of upper GI abnormalities in BD, but the abnormalities were not specific for the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Routine endoscopy and screening for H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may not be necessary in asymptomatic patients with BD </plain></SENT>
