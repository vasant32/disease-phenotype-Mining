<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive imaging methods may reveal a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorder</z:e> which has not manifested itself clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, radionuclide ventriculography and Doppler echocardiography were performed in 24 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease to assess the left ventricular systolic and diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had neither known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> nor cardiac symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radionuclide ventriculography was performed using 99mTc-labeled red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction (EF), EF fraction in the first 100 ms (EFV), peak ejection rate, time to peak ejection, 1/3 EF, time to end systole, peak filling rate (PFR), time to peak filling and 1/3 filling fraction (1/3 FF) values were computed using Fourier analysis of the time activity curve of the left ventricle with 3 harmonics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Doppler echocardiography (DE) has described impairment of diastolic compliance using analysis of mitral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean EF (54.7 +/- 9%), EFV (11.6 +/- 3.6%), PFR (2.49 +/- 0.58 EDC/s) and 1/3 FF (33.64 +/- 14%) values were significantly lower in patients than those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine (37.5%) patients demonstrated an impairment of diastolic function and 3 (12.5%) had abnormal systolic function observed by the radionuclide method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DE showed abnormal ventricular compliance in 13.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a conclusion, noninvasive imaging methods such as radionuclide ventriculography and DE may be valuable to detect diastolic impairment as an early sign of cardiac involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
