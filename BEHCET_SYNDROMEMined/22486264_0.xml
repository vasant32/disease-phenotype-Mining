<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical records of 14 Behçet's disease patients who were administered infliximab with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who were given other immunosuppresants after initiation of infliximab therapy were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ocular attacks and best-corrected visual acuity were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients received monotherapy and 7 received combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of ocular attacks significantly decreased from 2.14 to 0.22 per 6 months in monotherapy group and from 2.57 to 0.18 per 6 months in combination therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between both groups in the frequency of ocular attacks and in changes in best-corrected visual acuity during 0 to 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is as efficacious as infliximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicines</z:chebi> together in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> administration is not necessary in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients receiving infliximab </plain></SENT>
