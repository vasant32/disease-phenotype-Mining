<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHOD: Vitreoretinal surgery was applied to 26 eyes of 21 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative visual acuities, number and duration of attacks, anterior and posterior segment pathologies were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 33 years and female/male ratio was 6/15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity increased in 15 eyes (58%), did not change in 11 eyes (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative period, there was a significant decrease in mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks compared to the preoperative period (p=0.001), as well as a significant decrease in the mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative follow-up, intravitreal haemorrhage in 2 eyes (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0007787'>posterior subcapsular cataract</z:hpo> in 5 eyes (19%) and corticonuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> in 2 eyes (8%) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Posterior capsular opacification</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCO</z:e>) developed in 5 of 16 eyes (31%) having ECLE-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CME continued in 3 eyes (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vitreoretinal surgery has favourable effect on the visual and anatomic prognosis in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with severe ocular complications </plain></SENT>
