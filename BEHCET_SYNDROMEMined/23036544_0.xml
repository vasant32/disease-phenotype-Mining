<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 89 eyes of 89 subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These consisted of 56 patients with inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (group 1) and a control group of 33 age- and sex-matched subjects (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Schirmer-I and break-up time (BUT) tests were used to evaluate the tear film of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impression cytology was used to evaluate morphological changes of the conjunctival surface epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the 2 groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean Schirmer-I test result was 8.59 ± 4.83 in group 1 and 14.52 ± 6.38 in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for this test (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean BUT test value was 10.05 ± 3.26 in group 1 and 13.64 ± 4.28 in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for this test (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean impression cytology score was 1.65 ± 0.90 in group 1 and 1.39 ± 0.96 in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups when the cytology grade score was compared (p = 0.227) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no statistically significant difference for age, gender, disease duration, systemic drug use, Schirmer-I, BUT, and impression cytology degrees between the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with and without ocular involvement (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that there was a statistically significant difference between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects regarding the ocular film layer, but no difference regarding conjunctival surface epithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
