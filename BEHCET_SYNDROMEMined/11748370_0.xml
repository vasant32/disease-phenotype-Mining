<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is often difficult to recognize and diagnose the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 24-yr-old female patient showed massive central <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> which caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038833" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superior vena cava syndrome</z:e> after subclavian vein catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty days after catheterization, the patient exhibited swelling of the face, neck, and both upper extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite thrombectomy and continuous anticoagulation therapy, her facial and upper extremity swelling reappeared and follow-up chest computed tomography (CT) showed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in the same central veins previously affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of BD was then made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following steroid therapy, neither clinical symptoms nor CT findings suggestive of central <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were observed during the subsequent 6-months of follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case emphasizes that central venous catheterization in a patient with BD should be performed with great caution </plain></SENT>
