<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to examine the association of CCR6 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) in two Chinese Han populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 473 patients with BD and 725 healthy controls from two Chinese Han populations were genotyped by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the χ(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype frequencies were estimated by direct counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using the χ(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequencies of rs3093024, rs6902119, rs3093023 and rs2301436 were not different between patients with BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis according to gender and clinical findings including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo>, genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> did not show any association of the four tested polymorphisms with these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The tested CCR6 gene polymorphisms are not associated with the susceptibility to BD in the tested Chinese Han populations </plain></SENT>
