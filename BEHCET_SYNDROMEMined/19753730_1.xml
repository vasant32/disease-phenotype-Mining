<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Eye diseases</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> are also more common among males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease rarely developes before puberty or after the age of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of BD, with the exception of eye symptoms, tend to get better with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and histological pattern of the papulopustular lesions (PPL), the most common type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in BD and the difference from ordinary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> is contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, BD may be <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> driven to some degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, using <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> vulgaris (AV) as a prototype of an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> driven disease, we investigated such a possibility between PPL and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (AR) levels in the sebaceous glands (SG) of PPL from patients with BD and AV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with BD (10 women, 8 men; mean +/- SD age, 34 +/- 11 years), 16 patients with AV (10 women, 6 men; mean +/- SD age, 25 +/- 6.2 years), and 10 healthy volunteers (5 women, 5 men; mean +/- SD age, 36 +/- 12 years), were included in this controlled study with blind histological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of the PPL and adjacent (approximately 2 cm distant) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing skin in patients with BD and AV, and of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing skin from healthy volunteers were performed from the interscapular region, thus minimizing differences in androgenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follicle-based acneiform lesions were excluded for biopsies from patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nuclear AR levels of SG were studied by an immunohistochemical technique, using monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positively staining cells were recorded as the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor index (ARI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: The lesional skin of the patients with BD showed a higher ARI than non-lesional skin of those patients (34.3% and 23.82%), or the healthy controls (21.37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AR levels in the lesional skin of active patients was also higher than inactive patients (39.82 and 27.12%), but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ARI values in the lesional skin (78.58%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> patients were found to be significantly higher as compared with non-lesional skin (38.88%) and other groups (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> may play a role at least in the formation of PPL and disease activity in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">Androgen</z:chebi> metabolism takes place peripherally in the SG, being indipendent of the central <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Target organ sensitivity and excess number of nuclear AR seem to be responsible for the development of AV </plain></SENT>
