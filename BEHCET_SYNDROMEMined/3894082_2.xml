<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Comparative in vivo examinations of skin (cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test, skin window technique over 24 h according to Rebuck) were carried out in 12 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and in 13 healthy volunteers serving as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>10 out of 12 patients at active phases of BD showed a positive papular (-pustular) skin reactivity to needle prick or venepuncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These 10 patients simultaneously revealed an increased chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the controls <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> tests were negative and chemotaxis of PMNL was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of PMNL initially coming up to 100% in the skin window preparations, very rapidly decreased in patients with BD as compared to a distinctly slower drop in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely to the number of PMNL, the skin window cellular pattern was built up by monophagocytic cells replacing the PMNL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon of 'rapid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of PMNL', from skin window can be considered an additional hint on the functional disturbance of the PMNL involved in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
