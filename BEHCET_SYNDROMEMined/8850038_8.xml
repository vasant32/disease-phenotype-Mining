<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>��et's disease who had their first lesion at or before the age of 16 were evaluated in terms of: age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, mucocutaneous signs, and findings related to systemic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five patients, evaluated as having juvenile <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (JBD), were detected among 1784 Turkish <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of these 95 patients (51 boys or men, 44 girls or women) who had JBD was 26.8 +/- 7.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The difference between sexes in terms of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, development period of second lesions, and systemic involvement was not found to be significant in JBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups, one showing severe disease (N = 27) and the other mild disease (N = 68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to age, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interval between the development of the first and second lesions was shorter in the patient group with severe disease (P &lt; 0.001) and the development of second lesion was most frequently seen in the first 5 years (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systemic involvement developed also in a shorter time in the group with the severe disease (P &lt; 0.01) and was most frequently encountered during the first 5 years (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, patients with the mild disease developed systemic involvement more frequently after 6 years or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severe <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in children and juveniles shows no age or sex predilection, but leads to an earlier recurrence and more severe systemic signs than the mild form </plain></SENT>
