<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aorta was cross clamped below the renal arteries to insert a tube graft between the infra-renal aorta and the external iliac arteries with implantation of the internal iliac arteries on the prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to leakage from the posterior area of the proximal anastomosis, the proximal suture was redone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total cross clamping lasted 65 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No blood pressure drop was noted during or after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the neurological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> with mild sensorial deficit and fecal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fecal and urinary deficit resolved three months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly complete motor recovery was noted at the 18(th) postoperative month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient then presented oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> at 22 months postop leading to the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several risk factors have been suggested to explain spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after abnormal aortic surgery: anatomic variablility of spinal perfusion, duration of aortic cross clamping, and intra- or postoperative episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic damage to the arterial system due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease could also perturb spinal blood supply and reproduce one of the mechanisms incriminated in ischemic spinal lesions occurring during aortic surgery for atheromatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
