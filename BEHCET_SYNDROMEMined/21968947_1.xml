<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">Estrogens</z:chebi> influence many physiologic processes and are also implicated in the development or progression of numerous diseases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrations of lymphocyte homeostasis that lead to the production of multiple pathogenic autoantibodies, including autoantibodies specific to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER), have been detected in the peripheral blood of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the presence of both anti-ERα and anti-ERβ antibodies in sera from patients with SLE, to analyze the effect of these antibodies on peripheral blood T lymphocyte homeostasis, and to evaluate their role as determinants of disease pathogenesis and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-ER antibody serum immunoreactivity was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 86 patients with SLE and 95 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic and functional analyses were performed by flow cytometry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-ERα antibodies were present in 45% of the patients with SLE, whereas anti-ERβ antibodies were undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In healthy donors, anti-ERα antibodies induced cell activation and consequent apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in resting lymphocytes as well as proliferation of anti-CD3-stimulated T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant association between anti-ERα antibody values and clinical parameters, i.e., the SLE Disease Activity Index and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that anti-ERα autoantibodies interfere with T lymphocyte homeostasis and are significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus disease</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
