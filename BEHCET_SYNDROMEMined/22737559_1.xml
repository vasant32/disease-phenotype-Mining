<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesion is usually self limited but its painful presentation results in some difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an efficient therapeutic strategy is required and currently existing therapies seem to be inadequate because of its unclear etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here the therapeutic effect of triamcinolone acetonide ointment as a relatively expensive medication has been compared with phenytoin syrup on aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty out of 60 our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> were randomly treated by phenytoin syrup and the remaining were advised to use 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide ointment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a week, they were visited again to determine the status of aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Positive response in the triamcinolone acetonide group and phenytoin group was 86.7% and 53.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of triamcinolone acetonide ointment was more than phenytoin on aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
