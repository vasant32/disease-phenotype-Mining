<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the occurrence and clinical expression of BD in the northern region of Israel: in the whole population and by ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sample included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients with BD (International Study Group criteria) treated at three medical centers in northern Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient data were collected by file review and physician survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relevant demographic data for the population served by the medical centers were obtained from the official Israeli authorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 112 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of BD was 15.2/100,000 and was similar in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates among the Jewish, Arab, and Druze populations were 8.6, 26.2, and 146.4 per 100,000, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ethnic groups and significantly lower in males (28.6+/-9.7 vs 32.9+/-11.3, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in disease manifestations by sex or ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Druze patients were HLA-B5 positive, compared to 80.8% of the Arab patients and 72.0% of the Jewish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in family members were more common in Arab patients (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The BD severity index was significantly lower in Druze patients (p=0.05), mainly in males (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the high prevalence of BD in Israel and the variability in disease rates and expression by ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings, particularly regarding the Druze population, call for further field surveys and genetic studies </plain></SENT>
