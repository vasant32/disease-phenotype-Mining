<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CDAI score decreased from 270 points (preinfusion) to 13 points by week 2, and remission was sustained despite complete withdrawal of steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy performed 10 weeks after the first infusion showed marked endoscopic and histologic improvement </plain></SENT>
