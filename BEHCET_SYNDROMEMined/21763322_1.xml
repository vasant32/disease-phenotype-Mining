<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have reported that TREM-1 expression is up-regulated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the associations between TREM-1 genetic polymorphisms and IBD development and its phenotypes in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Three TREM-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs2234237, rs3789205, and rs9471535) were genotyped by Taqman technology on 202 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 265 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), 138 with intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), and 234 healthy controls and the relationships between these SNPs and IBD development and phenotypes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: We found that TREM-1 SNPs are significantly associated with the development of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (rs9471535: odds ratio [OR]=1.637, P=0.025; rs3789205: OR=1.668, P=0.019; rs2234237: OR=1.691, P=0.016), and in particular with skin involvement (rs9471535: OR=2.723, P=0.009; rs3789205: OR=2.477, P=0.017; rs2234237: OR=2.278, P=0.030) and the risk of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> use (rs9471535: OR=2.722, P=0.021; rs3789205: OR=2.493, P=0.032; rs2234237: OR=2.638, P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, TREM-1 SNPs were not significantly associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The results of our study suggest that TREM-1 SNPs may play a significant role in the development of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and may have modest effects on disease severity </plain></SENT>
