<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous free leucocyte migration was found to be significantly reduced, yet after stimulation the leucocyte's chemotactic activity was considerably increase (p less than 0-05) when compared to control leucocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control leucocytes migrated more rapidly when incubated in serum taken from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (p less than 0-005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enhanced chemotactic activity in Bechçet's disease appears to be due to both serum and intrinsic leucocyte factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> reduction was found to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, although after stimulation leucocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> reduction was lower than in the control group (P less than 0-025), as was leucocyte oxygen utilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the hyperreactive cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that characterises <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be due to increased chemotactic activity and minor alterations in functional metabolic activity of leucocytes </plain></SENT>
