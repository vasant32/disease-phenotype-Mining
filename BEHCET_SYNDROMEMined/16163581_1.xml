<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent years, endovascular treatment has been proposed as an effective and less invasive procedure compared with classical surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 29-year-old man with BD who had two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncopes</z:hpo> precipitated by pressure on a left cervical mass and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction of left basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other examinations demonstrated carotid and pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were treated by endovascular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient received treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by means of coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was initiated, a covered stent was placed to exclude the carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the level of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), with no immediate complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After twenty-seven months of follow-up the patient remains asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment may be a definite therapeutic option for extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in BD, although longer term follow-up studies are needed </plain></SENT>
