<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lately it has been used successfully in other diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007417'>discoid lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, actinic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prurigo</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its mechanism of action remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients for whom thalidomide provided relief in their disorder, the proportions of T lymphocytes and their subsets in peripheral blood were assessed by means of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lepromatous leprosy</z:e> patients with ENL had their T helper populations significantly increased after thalidomide therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same findings were observed in two patients with the actinic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prurigo</z:e> type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031736" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymorphous light eruption</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results, we conclude that thalidomide may act as an immunomodulating agent on T cell subsets </plain></SENT>
