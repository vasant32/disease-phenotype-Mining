<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the frequency and characteristics of posterior segment involvement and the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> in patients with ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 257 eyes of the 131 patients who were followed from 1993 to 2001 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> and BD division of SSK Ankara Eye Hospital, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 49.2 +/- 27.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one of the palents were female (23.6%) and 100 male (76.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 25.1 +/- 7.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fundus changes were observed in 213 (82.9%) eyes and were bilateral in 87%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitritis</z:e> was present in 239 (93%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent fundus changes were vascular sheathing in 61 eyes (23.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> in 46 (17.9%), macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in 29 (11.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 23 (9%), macular scar in 21 (8.2%), optic disc paleness in 19 (7.4%), <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in 17 (6.6%), branch <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion in 15 (5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography findings were diffuse vascular leakage in 98 (38%), hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in 38 (14.8%) and hyperfluorescence of the macula in 29 eyes (11.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was &lt;1/10 in 85 (33%) of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>Optic atrophy</z:hpo> was the main cause (54.1%) of permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Posterior segment involvement is the most serious ocular complication of BD, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> with recurrent attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Following patients closely, performing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed as BD even they have no clinical ocular involvement, and early treatment are very important in the prognosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
