<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to clarify the relation of active ocular lesions to inflammatory reactions covering entire body, we have detected LECAM-1, Mac-1 and CD44 expressed on the peripheral leukocytes in 24 Behçet patients and 15 healthy adults by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LECAM-1 and CD44 expression was dramatically decreased from the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) upon ocular attacks, whereas the changes in Mac-1 appeared not so striking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This tendency had continued into the recovery stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes showed, on the other hand, no considerable variability in regard to the expression of cell surface LECAM-1, CD44 and also of Mac-1 even at the peak of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that interaction between PMN and primed vascular endothelial cells might be apt to precede functional modifications of T lymphocytes, and it is also supposed that facilitation of activated PMN recruitment plays an essential role on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
