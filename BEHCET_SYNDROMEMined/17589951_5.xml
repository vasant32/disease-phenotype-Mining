<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients with BD diagnosed according to the International Study Group and followed up in the Department of Dermatology and other related departments and who had any upper gastrointestinal complaints, were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients with BD and 40 patients in the control group were evaluated by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and two biopsied specimens were taken during endoscopy for H pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A two-week triple therapy for H pylori eradication was administered to H pylori positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two months after the treatment, the patients were evaluated by <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>-breath test for eradication control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with BD had a mean age of 36.2 +/- 11.4 years (18-67 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 35 +/- 14 mo (16-84 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aphthous or deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in esophagus, stomach and duodenum had never been confirmed by endoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric lesions</z:e> were gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> (40%) and the most <z:mp ids='MP_0002580'>duodenal lesions</z:mp> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenitis</z:e> (17.5%) in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>H pylori was positive in 33 patients (73.3%) with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two-week triple eradication therapy was successful in 75% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the groups in respect to prevalence of H pylori (73.3% vs 75%, P &gt; 0.05), and eradication rate (75% vs 70%, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endoscopic findings, eradication rate and prevalence of H pylori were similar in patients with BD and control group </plain></SENT>
