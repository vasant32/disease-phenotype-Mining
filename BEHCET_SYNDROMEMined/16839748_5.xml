<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, BD is not a simple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disease</z:e> and it is exaggerated by exogenous stimuli such as microorganisms' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ficolin 2 is a lectin that binds to the surface of microbial cells and kills microbial cells through the activation of complement system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of human Ficolin 2 gene (FCN2 gene) have been recently identified in Caucasian people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to elucidate the contribution of FCN2 gene in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequencies of genotypes and alleles of FCN2 gene SNPs in the promoter regions (-987, -602, -557, -64, -4) and exon 8 (+6359, +6424) were examined in 83 patients with BD and 64 healthy controls by genotyping with a DNA sequencing method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of FCN2 gene SNPs between BD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of FCN2 gene SNPs were detected among different clinical subgroups in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in allele frequencies of FCN gene SNPs at both -557 and -64 sites in the promoter regions were found between HLA-B51 positive groups and HLA-B51 negative groups of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significant differences in allele frequencies of FCN2 gene SNPs in the promoter lesions (-557 and -64 sites) among HLA-B51 positive BD patients may reveal the possibility that ficolin may contribute to the innate immunity of BD among HLA-B51 haplotypes in BD patients </plain></SENT>
