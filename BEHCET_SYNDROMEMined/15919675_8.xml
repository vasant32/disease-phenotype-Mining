<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Two patients with BD with pulmonary involvement refractory to conventional immunosuppressive treatment underwent HSCT 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stem cells were mobilised with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (2 and 4 g/m(2)) and subsequently enriched ex vivo for CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen used was melphalan (200 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was measured by improvement of clinical features, function of affected organs, serological markers, need for immunosuppressive chemotherapy after transplant, and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases HSCT was successful, with good response and without serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 5 years of follow up one patient is in complete remission without immunosuppressive drugs and one has partial remission, needing low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (8 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In these two patients myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by HSCT could be performed safely with marked improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison with other observational studies the duration of more than 5 years of remission is remarkable, and its full duration is still unknown </plain></SENT>
