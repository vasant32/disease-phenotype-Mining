<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> is one of the major findings of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein Z (PZ) is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that acts as a cofactor of PZ-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> and suppresses trombus formation by inhibiting activated factor Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism of the PZ gene was mentioned as a genetic risk factor for various thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the intron F G79A polymorphism of the PZ gene in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with and without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six patients and 70 controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intron F G79A polymorphism of PZ gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction based DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of A allele and the distribution of genotypes were assessed by χ(2) test and the genotype distribution and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were tested with the χ(2) test for quality of fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the A allele was significantly higher in overall <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients than in controls (odds ratio [OR] = 6.8; 95% CI, 2.6 to 17.9; p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was also significantly higher in patients with (OR = 5.3; 95% CI, 1.83 to 15.6; p = 0.0024) or without (OR = 8.2; 95% CI, 2.95 to 22.5; p = 0.0001) ocular involvement compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, A allele frequency was not significantly different between patients with eye involvement versus patients without eye involvement (OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.4; p = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD is multifactorial, intron F G79A polymorphism of PZ gene in BD may be one of the factors that contribute to this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
