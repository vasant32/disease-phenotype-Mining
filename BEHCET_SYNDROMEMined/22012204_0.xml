<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven eyes of seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had unilaterally active <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> that failed to respond to conventional treatment, together with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007906'>increased intraocular pressure</z:hpo> or intolerance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravitreal injection of 400 μg MTX was given monthly until visual acuity and intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aqueous humor samples were obtained from the patients before MTX injection and from nine eyes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in visual acuity with the Early Treatment Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study Chart, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographic leakage, and ocular complications associated with intravitreal injection were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aqueous humor cytokine levels were measured by proteomic analysis using a multianalyte biochip array system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual acuity improved significantly during a mean follow-up of 24.9 ± 8.2 weeks with a mean improvement from baseline visual acuity of 3.3 ± 2.6 lines after a mean of 4.3 ± 1.0 injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (85.7%) showed an increase in visual acuity by 3 or more lines, and 4 patients exhibited a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Change in intraocular pressure after intravitreal MTX was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aqueous humor levels of interleukin (IL) -6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly reduced at 4 weeks after intravitreal MTX, whereas those of vascular endothelial growth factor and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 were not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased intraocular levels of IL-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 may be responsible for refractory <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intravitreal MTX was associated with a significant reduction of IL-6 and IL-8 levels and was effective and well tolerated even in steroid responders with refractory <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
