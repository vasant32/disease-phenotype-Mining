<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BD patients with and without vascular involvement were similar regarding carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (0.52+/-0.14; 0.51+/-0.09; 0.46+/-0.09; P=0.051), and brachial FMD (16.3+/-6.8; 16.5+/-9.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CFR values were significantly impaired in BD patients compared to the controls; however the BD patients with and without vascular involvement were similar regarding CFR (2.66+/-0.45; 2.62+/-0.48; 2.91+/-0.53, P=0.007 with and without vascular involvement and the controls, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelial and coronary microvascular functions are compromised in BD patients without vascular involvement as remarkably as that in patients with vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
