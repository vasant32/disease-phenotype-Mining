<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Digital <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) videoangiography were performed in 53 eyes and color Doppler ultrasonography in 61 eyes of 31 Behçet patients, between December 1993-January 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography revealed no vascular leakage in 7, and diffuse <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and/or disc leakage due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in 46 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 14 eyes while it revealed hypo or hyperfluorescence in the remaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the CRA, peak systolic and end diastolic velocities were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients than in control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group, Doppler indices did not differ significantly in eyes which had choroidal abnormalities and those that did not, according to ICG angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, some abnormalities in the choroid may be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disease appears to be associated with decreased mean flow velocities in CRA </plain></SENT>
