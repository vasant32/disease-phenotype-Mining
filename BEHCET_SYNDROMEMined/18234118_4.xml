<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate signaling that triggers activation of the innate immune system, whereas <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO)-1 (an inducible <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-degrading enzyme that is induced by various stresses) suppresses <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the interaction between TLR and HO-1 in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e>, namely <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 30 healthy control individuals were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of HO-1, TLR2 and TLR4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were semiquantitatively analyzed using a real-time PCR technique, and HO-1 protein level was determined by immunoblotting in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some experiments, cells were stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> or heat shock protein-60; these proteins are known to be ligands for TLR2 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of expression of HO-1 mRNA were significantly reduced in PBMCs from patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, whereas those of TLR4, but not TLR2, were increased in PBMCs, regardless of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HO-1 expression in PBMCs from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was repressed in the presence of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> or heat shock protein-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that upregulated TLR4 is associated with HO-1 reduction in PBMCs from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, leading to augmented <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
