<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients (41 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's and 12 with allied conditions) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A daily oral dose of FK506 was initially 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 or 0.2 mg/kg, but adjusted in more than half patients during the study based on clinical conditions of patients and/or adverse effects of FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The improvement rate of initial daily dose as well as final improvement rate were evaluated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The improvement rate of initial daily dose was increased dose-dependently; 37.5% with 0.05 mg/kg initial daily dose group, 60.0% with 0.1 mg/kg, 91.7% with 0.15 mg/kg and 78.6% with 0.2 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The final improvement rate was 76.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, ocular symptoms improved in 30 (75.0%) of 40 patients evaluable for efficacy and the frequency of ocular attacks was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight (66.7%) of 12 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in whom cyclosporin treatment had been failed, their ocular symptoms improved by FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Main adverse reactions of FK506 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (28.3%), neurologic symptoms (22.6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (20.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> (28.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> (13.2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (13.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the adverse effects disappeared or ameliorated after FK506 dose reduction or withdrawal from FK506 therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It seems that the incidence of the adverse effects depends on the dosage of FK506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lower dosage (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) caused a relatively small number of adverse effects, and the higher dosage (0.15 and 0.2 mg/kg) caused them more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Through level is recommended to maintain between 15-25 ng/ml during early days of treatment based on the safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is also recommended that a initial daily dose is 0.15 mg/kg on the basis of the efficacy and safety results, and then adjusted based on symptoms of patients and whole blood through level of FK506 </plain></SENT>
