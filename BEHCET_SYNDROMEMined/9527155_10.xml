<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients showed evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, and 10 of these had radiologically confirmed dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients presented with a meningoencephalitic or meningomyelitic picture, three with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like picture, and three with primarily brain stem signs </plain></SENT>
