<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical outcomes and related risk factors of postoperative complications in BD patients undergoing cardiovascular surgeries, as well as the long-term efficiency of postoperative immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one patients with BD who had undergone cardiovascular surgery between 1990 and 2009 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the patients' clinical data, postoperative complications, and survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors related to the occurrence of postoperative complications were identified by univariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine operations were performed in 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the mean follow-up period of 65.3±48.1 months, complications such as paravalvular leakage, dehiscence, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, graft occlusion, or pseudoaneurysm occurred in 29 operations (49.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative occurrence rate of postoperative complication was 10.2% at three months, 32.8% at 12 months, and 43.8% at 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon univariate analysis, young age, high Creactive protein levels, lack of postoperative immunosuppression, and short disease duration were identified as significant factors responsible for the occurrence of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, postoperative immunosuppression was found to independently lower the risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with postoperative immunosup immunosuppression than in those without (84.5% vs. 45.0%, p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that postoperative immunosuppressive therapy after cardiovascular surgeries in BD patients is important for reducing the development of serious postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
