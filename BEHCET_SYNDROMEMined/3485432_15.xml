<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with active disease, but not those with inactive disease, were found to have elevated numbers of cells spontaneously secreting immunoglobulin and a decreased B cell response to the T cell-independent B cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, B cells from almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were unresponsive to the T cell-dependent polyclonal activator, pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that B cell abnormalities, including some which are associated with disease activity, could be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
