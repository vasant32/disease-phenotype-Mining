<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both uncommon and common serotypes induced platelet aggregation in rabbit platelet-rich plasma, but <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> release was higher with the uncommon serotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aggregation at ATP release varied between uncommon and common serotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With human platelet-rich plasma, only uncommon serotypes showed aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in serotype selectivity and the rate of aggregation were noted among platelet donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About half of the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 30% of health controls showed platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma from non-responder patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease inhibited aggregation of healthy responder platelets within 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus selective binding of uncommon serotypes of Strep. sanguis to platelets might cause the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
