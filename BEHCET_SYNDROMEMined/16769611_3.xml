<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate blood flow velocity changes and resistivity index values of orbital vessels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease with or without ocular involvement, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients with different etiologies, and in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were divided into four groups: those with ocular involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (group I), those without ocular involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (group II), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients with different etiologies (group III), and a control group (group IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven eyes in group I, 14 eyes in group II, 25 eyes in group III, and 27 eyes in group IV were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood flow in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (CRA), ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>), nasal posterior ciliary artery (NPCA), and the temporal posterior ciliary artery (TPCA) was measured using color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) to determine the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistivity index (RI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PSV and EDV value of CRA in groups I, II, and III were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group (p &lt; 0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PSV and EDV values of TPCA and NPCA in groups I, II, and III were significantly lower than those in the control group (p &lt; 0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resistivity indexes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arteries were higher in groups I, II, and III than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PSV and EDV in CRA, TPCA, and NPCA in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease patients with ocular involvement were significantly lower than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant reductions in the blood flow values of the orbital arteries in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients with different etiologies when compared with healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease in blood flow values in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is more evident in patients with ocular involvement than the patients without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This might be the result of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, which is frequently seen in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
