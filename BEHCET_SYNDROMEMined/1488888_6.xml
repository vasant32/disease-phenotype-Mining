<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HLA B5 differs between racial groups and geographical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ocular involvement, which could lead to serious complications, is a very important feature of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various racial groups having different genetic properties live in the Cukurova region, located in southern Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of HLA B5 in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Cukurova region, HLA B5 antigens were investigated by lymphocytotoxicity assay in 65 patients and 200 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher frequency was found in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither ocular involvement, nor the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> showed any correlation with HLA B5, but it was found that patients presenting with frequent ocular attacks had significantly higher HLA B5 positivity than the patients with rare attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that HLA B5 would be a negative factor in visual prognosis in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
