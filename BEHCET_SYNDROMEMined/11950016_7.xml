<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between clinical features and the interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease in pairs of related Japanese patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to hospitals in which patients with familial occurrence of BD had been treated according to previous nationwide hospital surveys, and to an additional 341 hospitals selected at random </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 35 patients (19 male, 16 female) in 17 families (19 related pairs) were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of HLA-B51 was 60.9% (14/23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The familial pairs were divided into 2 groups, with the mean interval between disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between each pair being either &lt; or = 9 years or &gt; or = 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the short interval group, the total number of clinical findings and difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was significantly larger than the long interval group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> had a high positive correlation with concordance of clinical findings and a high negative correlation with the difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age had a higher negative correlation with same sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, age difference had a high negative correlation with HLA-B5 (B51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of data showed that the related pairs with the short interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> had larger difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age and greater concordance of symptoms than the long interval patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although our findings did not show any direct evidence of an environmental cause in the etiology of BD, we speculate that there may be a multifactorial etiology including genetic factors such as HLA-B51 positivity </plain></SENT>
