<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, such a mechanism alone fails to explain various aspects of hyperreactivity response which is a unique feature manifested with lesions similar to those occurring spontaneously in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>19 patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease have been investigated for possible mechanisms other than cell mediated which may be involved in the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beside cell-mediated mechanisms there were indications that polymorphonuclear leucocytes and mast cells may play part in the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further study of these two aspects may open a new approach in the understanding and possibly in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
