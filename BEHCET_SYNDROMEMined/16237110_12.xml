<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraocular infiltration of TCRalphabeta+CD8brightCD56+ cells was a distinct feature in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, phenotypic natures and effector functions of the cells have remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine phenotypic and functional characteristics and cytotoxic mechanisms of CD8brightCD56+ T cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD11b+CD27-CD62L- phenotypes of CD8brightCD56+ T cells were increased in patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> compared with inactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CD45RAdimCD45RO- phenotypes were expanded, and CD94 expression was markedly up-regulated in contrast to the down-regulation of NKG2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these subsets were polarized to produce IFN-gamma and contained high amounts of preformed intracellular perforin while exclusively expressing surface FasL upon PI stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cytolytic functions of freshly isolated CD8brightCD56+ T cells were up-regulated against both K562 (NK-sensitive) and Raji (NK-resistant) cells, which were effectively inhibited by perforin inhibitor (concanamycin A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their cytolytic activity against HUVECs was also increased and was effectively suppressed by Fas ligand inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi>) and partly by perforin inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytolytic functions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and ionomycin-stimulated CD8brightCD56+ T cells against HUVECs were greatly enhanced, by pretreatment of recombinant human IFN-gamma on HUVECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CD8brightCD56+ T cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> are characterized by cytotoxic effector phenotypes with functional NK receptors and function as strong cytotoxic effectors through both Fas ligand-dependent and perforin-dependent pathways </plain></SENT>
