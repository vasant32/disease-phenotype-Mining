<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the regulatory role of natural killer (NK) cells in Th1-biased immune responses in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 47 patients with BD, including 10 with active disease (aBD) and 37 with inactive disease (iBD), and 29 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activation status and cytotoxic activity of NK cells were examined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for immune modulatory and cytotoxic molecules in NK cells were determined by quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IL-12 signal strength in NK cells was determined by assessing the phosphorylation state of its downstream component, signal transducer and activator of transduction 4, by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, NK cells' ability to modulate the Th1 response was evaluated by co-culturing NK cells and T cells without cell contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD69+-activated NK cells were significantly increased in aBD compared with iBD or control samples, although their cytotoxic activities were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The iBD NK cells showed downregulated IL-12 receptor beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels compared with aBD or control NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased IL-13 expression was detected in a subset of BD patients: most of them had iBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The IL-13 expression level in iBD patients was significantly higher than the level in controls, but was not statistically different compared with the level in aBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profile in iBD patients was consistent with the NK type 2 phenotype, and the shift to NK type 2 was associated with disease remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NK cells from iBD patients showed impaired IL-12-induced signal transducer and activator of transduction 4 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, iBD, but not control, NK cells suppressed IFNgamma expression by aBD-derived CD4+ T cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NK cells may control disease flare/remission in BD patients via NK type 2-mediated modulation of the Th1 response </plain></SENT>
