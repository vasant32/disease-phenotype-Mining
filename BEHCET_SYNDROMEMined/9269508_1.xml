<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary manifestations are rare, and there is no specific test to establish the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> for the precise differentiation between the active and inactive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085129" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bronchial hyperreactivity</z:e> (BHR) measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6804">methacholine</z:chebi> challenge test and serum total IgE concentrations were investigated in 31 patients who were followed at <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Center in hospital clinic and ten healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients studied had no evidence of neither any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>-both allergic and nonallergic-nor family history of atopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients (45.16%) with active lesions mean IgE levels were higher than inactive group, 156.43 +/- 381.14 kU/L and 94.42 +/- 147.55 kU/L respectively (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found high total IgE levels in eight patients (25.81%) with BD, though they were unrelated to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our study, BHR related with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's chronicity were also found to be positive in eight patients (25.81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time elapsed since the first diagnosis of the disease in patients with positive BHR was (11.13 +/- 3.72 years) significantly longer than inactive group (7.10 +/- 4.49 years) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between BHR and serum IgE levels in patients with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that BHR may probably reflects nonspecific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> which is seen in BD, but cannot be regarded as a specific marker </plain></SENT>
