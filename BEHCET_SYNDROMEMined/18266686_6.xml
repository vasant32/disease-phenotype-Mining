<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The young adults are most often affected, usually during the third decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Late occurrence of the disease is considered uncommon and less frequently investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the clinical features of BD patients with disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at a later age and compare them with the usual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical charts of BD patients was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> at or after 40 years of age were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical profiles and medications required to control the disease activity were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of clinical features and the medications used were made between patients with disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before and after 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> BD patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them, five patients required the use of systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> for adequate disease control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no significant difference in clinical profiles between patients with disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before and after 40 years of age, but the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, an indicator of unfavourable prognosis, was surprisingly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More specifically, it was noted in four of seven patients identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the clinical course of BD is not indolent in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More importantly, physicians should be aware that BD can occur in older patients, and close attention regarding their disease activities is warranted as their clinical courses may not be as benign as previously believed </plain></SENT>
