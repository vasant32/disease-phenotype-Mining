<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a criterion in many classification/diagnosis criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PT is mainly seen in BD but can be seen in other conditions too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PT has been reported with high frequency from most countries along the Silk Road </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> phenomenon (PP) is declining over the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to look for the diagnostic value of PT in the past and at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BD registry (Rheumatology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences) has the data of 6,607 BD and 4,292 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls were divided in four groups of 1,650 BD and 1,073 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>-NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratio (PLR-NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and Youden's index (YI) were calculated for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first and the fourth quartiles were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of PT decreased from 64.2% (first quartile) to 35.8% (fourth quartile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specificity improved from 86.6% to 98.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> improved from 82.7% to 95.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NPV decreased from 82.7% to 60.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PLR improved from 4.8 to 22.4, while NLR deteriorated from 0.41 to 0.65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DOR improved from 11.6 to 34.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Yuden's index worsened from 0.5 to 0.34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although sensitivity of PP decreased, the increase of specificity is a plus value for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As a result, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, PLR, and DOR improved, while NPR, NLR, and YI deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test lost its sensitivity during the past 35Â years, it has not lost its value as a diagnostic test, improving many of its characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In a practical view, the chances of getting a positive test have decreased over the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, a positive test is rather the synonym of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, with a probability of 98.4% </plain></SENT>
