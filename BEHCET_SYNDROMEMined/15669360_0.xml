<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But despite their scarcity, they represent a life-threatening complication and are usually regarded as of a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aims to describe the epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 180 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> according to the criteria of the international study group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, four were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> (2.22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were male, the mean age at the time of the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> was 29.8 years and the mean disease duration was 6.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>Hemoptysis</z:hpo> was the presenting symptom in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcome was good with disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and disappearance of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> 40 months after the first episode and died 18 months later </plain></SENT>
