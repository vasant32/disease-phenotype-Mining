<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of 93 patients who were diagnosed and medically treated with intestinal BD at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea from 1992 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A therapeutic response was evaluated 8 weeks after the initiation of medical treatment, and cumulative recurrence and surgery rates were also assessed during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial remission rate at 8 weeks after treatment was 66.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, cumulative recurrence rates for intestinal BD were 24.9% at 2 years and 43.0% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with apparent gastrointestinal symptoms at their initial presentation, volcano-type and deep <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp>, and those who failed to achieve complete remission during the initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative rates for surgery were 6.7% at 2 years and 15.1% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The typical type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> was the only predictive factor for the likelihood of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that a considerable number of patients experience disease relapse during follow-up despite a high-remission rate after medical treatment for intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Careful observation and intensive treatment should be carried out, especially in patients without complete remission after initial treatment, with deep and volcano-shaped <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, or with apparent gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
