<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on two brothers with ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> who had advanced unilateral ophthalmic symptoms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two brothers had recurrent oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and white patches on their skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most probable hypothesis for the aetiology of BD is that of an autoimmune reaction in genetically predisposed individuals, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> as the main pathological hallmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite many years of research, the specific causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> remain obscure, and the most advanced aetiological hypothesis remains that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first reported case within the literature of BD associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The existence of the two different disorders is noteworthy as they were observed in two brothers during the same period in their lives, with very similar clinical observations </plain></SENT>
