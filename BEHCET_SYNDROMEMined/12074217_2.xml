<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ferritin as a serum predictor of iron storage is an important <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed serum ferritin levels in patients with active BD and compared them with those of patients with inactive BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to show the relationship between ferritin and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with BD were subdivided into two groups according to disease activity: active (24 patients; 18 men and 6 women, average age 36.5 +/- 4.9 [28-45] years), and inactive (20 patients; 16 men and 4 women, average age 37.2 +/- 5.2 [30-49] years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy volunteers (15 men and 5 women; average age 38.2 +/- 4.6 [30-47] years) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with active BD had significantly higher serum ferritin levels (p=0.0001) than the inactive and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ferritin levels in patients with inactive BD did not differ significantly from healthy control subjects (p=0.687) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that in patients with active BD, serum ferritin levels are increased and do not reflect serum iron levels </plain></SENT>
