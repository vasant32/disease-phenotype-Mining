<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial activation or injury is a characteristic feature of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is widely regarded as being the initial lesion in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The carotid artery intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) is a widely accepted marker of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, We aimed to determine the carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in BD patients with using high-resolution B-mode Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 40 patients (24 males, mean age: 39.1+/-8.5 years) who were diagnosed by the international diagnostic criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 20 healthy controls (13 males, mean age: 40.2+/-5.1 years), and the two groups were matched by age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No subject in either group had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or its complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical data, including the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, the duration of disease, a history of medication, the activity score and the laboratory data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in the BD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.71+/-0.22 mm vs. 0.59+/-0.09 mm, respectively, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac and major vessel involvements were not identified in the BD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, minor vascular involvements were documented in 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, in 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and in 2 patients with pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was higher than that of the patients without these findings (0.85+/-0.21 mm vs. 0.64+/-0.10 mm, respectively, p=0.007), but there was no difference of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> according to minor vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite that there was no significant cardiovascular involvement in the BD patients, the carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly higher in the BD patients as compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
