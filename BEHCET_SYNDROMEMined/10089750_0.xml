<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results of 27 eyes of 19 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease that had undergone <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery with or without intraocular lens implantation from October 1993 to December 1996 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 13 to 50 months (average, 28 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Visual acuity improved postoperatively in 25 eyes, to 20/40 or better in 9 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 19 eyes, ocular attacks were seen within the preoperative 6 months in 2 eyes, and within the postoperative 6 months in 8 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 eyes, the first ocular attacks occurred within 2 months after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ocular attacks increased after the surgery in 7 patients who received immunosuppressive a gents, with relatively short duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the frequency of ocular attacks increases after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery in some patients who use <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> for controlling ocular attacks, even though they had no inflammatory history for a long period before the surgery </plain></SENT>
