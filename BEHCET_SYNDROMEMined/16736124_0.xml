<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperimmunoglobulinemia</z:e> has been demonstrated in BD; however, its clinical importance has not yet been discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a few reports, an association between BD and plasma immunoglobulin E (IgE) has been noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we had three objectives: (1) to investigate plasma levels of IgE and their association with levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants, (2) to determine whether treatment has any effect upon IgE levels, and (3) to assess whether higher serum levels of IgE provide a clue for the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients with BD, without any accompanying disease or condition that might lead to a rise in IgE, were compared with 51 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of IgE, IgA, IgG, and IgM were analyzed by means of nephelometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results showed that among the 52 patients, 23 (44%) had IgE levels that were higher than the upper limits of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgE was not correlated with age, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein (p=0.59, p=0.57, and p=0.757, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These relationships remained nonsignificant when multiple regression analysis was performed, with R (2) of 0.187 and p=0.057 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment of patients with elevated IgE did not produce any predictable IgE response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients commonly exhibit elevated plasma IgE levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, elevated IgE levels are not correlated with levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants or disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that IgE levels might be an independent diagnostic clue in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
