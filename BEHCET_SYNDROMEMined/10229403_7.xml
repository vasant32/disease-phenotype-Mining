<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Increased numbers of spontaneous Ig secreting B cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>elevated immunoglobulin levels</z:hpo> have been described in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), in addition to changes in numbers and activities of T cells, natural killer cells, and monocyte-macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated other characteristics of B cells in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: B lymphocyte subsets (CD19+CD5+, CD19+CD13+, CD19+CD28+, CD19+CD33+, CD19+CD80+, CD5+CD19+CD45RA+, CD5+CD19+CD45RO+) were phenotypically evaluated in 50 patients with BD, 80 healthy subjects, and 20 other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the B cell number (CD19+) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, CD13 and CD33 positive B cells were more numerous in BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> compared to healthy controls and patients with RA and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD45RO positive B cells was higher in both BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, while the percentage of CD80 positive B cells was high only in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in the CD5+CD19+ B cell subset, previously shown to be increased in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Naive (CD45RA) and memory (CD45RO) status of CD5+CD19+ and CD5-CD19+ B cells showed that CD45RA expression was higher in CD5+CD19+ B cells, whereas expression of both CD45RA and CD45RO was higher in the CD5-CD19+ B cell group compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the total B cell number was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, increased levels of activated and memory B cell subsets suggest a modified B cell function in BD, which may be related to a weak stimulus by an unknown external antigen </plain></SENT>
