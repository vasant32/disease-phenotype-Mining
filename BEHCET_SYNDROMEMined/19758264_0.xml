<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyse the spectrum of mucocutaneous manifestations in 202 patients with Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (ABD) in Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Any mucocutaneous symptom at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and during the follow-up was recorded in a particular questionnaire that included 58 items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consecutive patients (130 men and 72 women) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 42.03 +/- 12.41 and 44.96 +/- 11.99 years for male and female patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> test was positive in 38%, whereas HLA-B5 (51) positivity was evident in 76% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> signs: oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were found in 64.36%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in 6.93%, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in 8.91%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum in 7.42% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406191" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudofolliculitis</z:e> in 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were found in 100%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in 65.4% and in 51.4%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum in 42.9% and in 78.1%, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406191" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudofolliculitis</z:e> in 57.1% and in 21.9% in men and women respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant differences pointing to a different course of mucocutaneous disease were found between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The nature and frequency of mucocutaneous manifestations at presentation are important for the diagnosis of ABD, whereas significant differences were found between genders in this Greek patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were also observed when our results were compared with those of four other series, probably explained by genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
