<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty New Zealand rabbits (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> males) were selected to establish the mechanical corneal epithelial defects models (scratching out a round area with the diameter of 8 mm in the centre of cornea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty eight New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups: group A used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6472">lincomycin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> eye drops (LED) after the model had been established; group B used vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> eye gel and LED; group C used recombinant bFGF eye gel and LED; group D used vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> eye gel, bFGF eye gel and LED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Photo slit lamp examination and measurement of repaired area were performed on day 0, day 1, day 4 and day 7; transmission electron microscopy, histological microscope examination and impression cytology were performed on day 0, day 1, day 4 and day 7 to analysis the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and repairment of corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelial cells and the goblet cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variants were tested using analysis of variance and Tukey's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistic analysis showed that on day 1, the size of areas of repaired corneal epithelium was: group A(53.512 +/- 18.850) mm(2), group B (92.194 +/- 14.367) mm(2), group C (89.779 +/- 20.535) mm(2), group D (127.816 +/- 16.379) mm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in size of repaired areas between different groups was statistically significant (F = 17.663, P = 0.000), with exception of the difference between groups B and C (P = 0.995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conjunctival impression cytology showed that, the average number of conjunctival goblet cells per 740 microm x 550 microm at day 1 was decreased, group A (10.083 +/- 4.441), group B (10.667 +/- 3.551), group C (9.583 +/- 4.502), group D (9.167 +/- 5.606) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between these four groups was not significant (F = 0.239, P = 0.868) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At day 4, the size of areas of repaired corneal epithelium was: group A (120.369 +/- 11.839) mm(2), group B (156.606 +/- 8.087) mm(2), group C (154.216 +/- 9.990) mm(2), group D (175.181 +/- 5.168) mm(2), which showed a significant difference between each two groups (F = 37.665, P = 0.000), with exception between groups B and C (P = 0.968) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average number of goblet cells at day 4 was recovered, which was: group A (41.250 +/- 4.575), group B (56.083 +/- 6.374), group C (48.417 +/- 4.562), group D (61.917 +/- 5.017), with a significant difference between these four groups (F = 36.210, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At day 7, the size of areas of repaired corneal epithelium had a statistical significance (F = 32.656, P = 0.000) between these four groups, which was group A (177.472 +/- 3.585) mm(2), group B (186.715 +/- 3.022) mm(2), group C (182.293 +/- 3.158) mm(2), group D (194.106 +/- 2.176) mm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The area of repaired corneal epithelium in group D was larger than that of other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The average number of goblet cells was recovered significantly, which was: group A (63.167 +/- 11.488), group B (99.501 +/- 15.877), group C (82.015 +/- 9.175), group D (104.750 +/- 9.659) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in goblet cell number between these groups (F = 30.312, P = 0.000) with exception between groups B and D (P = 0.700) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In transmission electron microscope examination of the cornea, we found that vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and bFGF could both promote the development of intracellular conjunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> protected corneal epithelial cells, prevented cell keratinization, promoted proliferation and differentiation of corneal epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In transmission electron microscopy examination of the conjunctiva, conjunctival goblet cells in groups B and D recovered well with rich secretary granules, which were quite different from groups A and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Conjunctival epithelium of groups B, C and D were well-differentiated with tight intracellular conjunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and bFGF could promote the repair of mechanical corneal epithelial defects and the development of intracellular conjunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The effect is more significant when vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> is combined with bFGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> promotes regeneration of conjunctival goblet cells and can re-establish intracellular conjunction of conjunctival epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of vitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> on conjunctival goblet cells is better than that of bFGF </plain></SENT>
