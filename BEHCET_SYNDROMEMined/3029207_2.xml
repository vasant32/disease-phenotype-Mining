<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> production by the leukocytes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> patients was significantly higher in the attack phase than in the remission phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation was also enhanced in guinea pigs with S-antigen-induced experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If the animals were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of EAU, aqueous humor cell count was significantly lower than that of control (i.e., without SOD treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infiltration of the inflammatory cells in the anterior retina was markedly reduced in SOD-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar protective effect of SOD against tissue damage was also observed in a bovine serum albumin-induced passive Arthus type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> may play a role in causing tissue damage in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> and possibly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
