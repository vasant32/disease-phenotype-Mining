<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used patient sera to immuno-blot tissue lysates, and we found that some patients manifest antibodies to a 37-kDa band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 37-kDa band was detected in extracts of skin, tongue, vagina, muscle and heart but not in brain, kidney, lung, liver, intestine and thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-gel digestion and mass spectrometry revealed the band to be alpha-tropomyosin </plain></SENT>
