<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to clarify the probable differential cognitive/behavioral profiles of MS and NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty consecutive cases with parenchymal NBD (13 male, seven female), and 20 cases with MS (five male, 15 female) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups had a thorough neurological examination; an evaluation for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>Sclerosis</z:mp> Functional Composite (MSFC), and Beck's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale; and a detailed neuropsychological evaluation masked to the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the two groups, male/female ratio differed significantly while other demographic and clinical features were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In California Verbal Learning Test, both short- and long-term delayed recall and cued recognition were worse in neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had impaired semantic clustering and increased false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stroop Test was also more impaired in neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They needed significantly more trials to complete the first category of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and had a poorer total Frontal Behavioral Inventory Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients have a more severe "frontal"-executive dysfunction than MS patients </plain></SENT>
