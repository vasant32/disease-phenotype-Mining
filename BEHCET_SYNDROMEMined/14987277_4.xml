<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the possible association of both diseases with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (17 female, nine male) with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, 28 patients (17 female, 11 male) with BD and 31 (22 female, nine male) healthy control subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were studied for erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and plasma nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte SOD activity in BD patients was significantly higher than in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although SOD activity in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients was higher than in controls, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in CAT activities or NO levels were found between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, changes in SOD activity may be important in the inflammatory reactions observed in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, but NO does not seem to play a primary role in the aetiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
