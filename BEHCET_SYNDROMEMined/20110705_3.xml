<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our aim was to document the frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) at endoscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, we aimed to analyze whether GI lesions were correlated with other systemic components of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with BD were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom optimal colonoscopic examination of both the colon and terminal ileum could be performed were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ileum biopsy was taken from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upper GI endoscopy findings, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, dermatological lesions, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test, neurological involvement and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and laboratory findings were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty age- and sex-matched persons who had perfect bowel cleansing and had a macroscopically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and terminal ileum at colonoscopy without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> were enrolled as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients and 1 case had macroscopic ileum and colon lesions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of BD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon and terminal ileum at colonoscopy revealed 61% abnormal ileum histologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That ratio was 30% for the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had any lesions suggesting BD at upper GI endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between macro- or microscopic GI involvement and other components of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower GI tract, especially ileum involvement, is frequent in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients have <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the ileum even in the absence of macroscopic lesions </plain></SENT>
