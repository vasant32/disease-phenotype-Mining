<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to estimate its direct and indirect costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 119 (78 male/41 female) patients with BS at our multidisciplinary BS out-patient clinic in Istanbul, between March and July 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age and disease duration were 35 +/- 9 and 10 +/- 6 S.D. yrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the primary clinical problem, patients were divided into: (i) ocular; (ii) vascular; (iii) neurological and (iv) mucocutaneous-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint disease</z:e> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire addressing: (a) direct costs such as medication, diagnostic tests, hospital visits, hospitalization fees and lodging and transportation expenses and (b) indirect costs such as lost workdays and wages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The costs were assessed retrospectively by assessing the expenses within a year of the survey and were expressed as US$ mean +/- S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean annual total cost per patient was US$ 3226 +/- 3488 (S.D.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The direct cost accounted for 68% of the total cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medication expenses made up 79% of the total direct cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About 42% of the patients reported lost workdays that averaged 119 +/- 96 days S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the clinical subgroups mucocutaneous-joint involvement (US$ 1180 +/- 1053) had the lowest economic impact while the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> (US$ 5005 +/- 2707) had the highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this first cost of illness study in BS, the neurological involvement had the highest annual cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Direct costs were higher than the indirect costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Drug costs were the major cost driver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>BS causes considerable economic burden for the health care system in Turkey </plain></SENT>
