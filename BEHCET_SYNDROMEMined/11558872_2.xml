<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the surface pH in different regions of the oral cavity in healthy volunteers and in patients with diseases affecting the oral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral pH was measured with a flat glass electrode on the anterior third of the ventral surface of the tongue, middle hard palate, buccal mucosa and inner lips in 32 healthy volunteers, 12 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease, 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206139" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral lichen planus</z:e>, and 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006430" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">burning mouth syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that there was an uneven distribution of oral surface pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The palate had a higher pH than most other sites in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lichen planus</z:e>, the palate pH was higher than that in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with dentures had lower pH values in the hard palate than dentate patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relatively high pH in the palate region in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups as well as healthy volunteers needs to be further studied to clarify its mechanisms and clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
