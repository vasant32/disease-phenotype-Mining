<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five Italian patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD and 235 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors were genotyped for the -463 G/A promoter polymorphism of the MPO gene by molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of the MPO -463A/G polymorphism did not differ significantly between the BD patients and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the -463 A allele (A/A or A/G) [odds ratio (OR) 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5-1.1] and homozygosity for A allele (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.3) were less frequent among BD patients than among the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found when BD patients with and those without clinical manifestations were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the -463 G/A promoter polymorphism of the MPO gene is not associated with susceptibility to, and clinical expression of, BD in Italian patients </plain></SENT>
