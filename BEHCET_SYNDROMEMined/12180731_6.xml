<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in a southern Chinese population and compare them with those reported in other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BD from 4 large regional hospitals in Hong Kong were identified from the hospital information retrieval system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their records were retrospectively reviewed and the diagnosis was verified by at least 2 rheumatologists using the International Study Group (ISG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic data and various clinical features of our patients were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1978 and 2000, 37 adult patients with definite BD according to the ISG criteria were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were ethnic southern Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 19 women and 18 men (F:M = 1.1:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 36.2 +/- 10 (18-74) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presenting features at diagnosis, in decreasing order of frequency, were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> (100%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> (81%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (73%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> (54%), and ocular lesions (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, the commonest manifestations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (74%), <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> (44%), and acneiform nodules (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> was usually polyarticular (75%) and symmetrical, and involved the upper limb joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>Anterior uveitis</z:hpo> was the most common ocular complication (77%) and was often bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Involvement of other systems such as the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and cardiopulmonary system was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vascular complications were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only 2 (6%) patients had a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our patients were followed for a mean of 59.9 +/- 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Apart from recurrent attacks of orogenital ulceration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, new systemic features were unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One patient died of bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> as a result of active GI disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Compared with other reported series, our patients had fewer ocular and systemic manifestations, and a significantly lower incidence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BD is rare among southern Chinese in Hong Kong and tends to run a more benign course with less systemic involvement and fewer serious ocular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Whether the observed difference in clinical manifestations of the disease is related to a different HLA association or environmental factors warrants further studies </plain></SENT>
