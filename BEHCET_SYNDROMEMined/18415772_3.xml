<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We analysed the production of soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptors sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 at sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and measured their plasma concentrations to evaluate them as biological markers of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma samples of 35 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) were collected prospectively at monthly intervals and grouped for inactive disease, active BD without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and active BD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 concentrations were measured using immunoassays and compared with other biological disease activity parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma sTNFR levels were compared to synovial fluid (SF) levels in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen tissue samples of mucocutaneous lesions were stained for TNFR2 expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were found at increased plasma concentrations in active BD, with the highest concentration in active BD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of both sTNFRs were at least three times higher in SF of arthritic joints than in the corresponding plasma samples (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A change of more than 1 ng/mL of sTNFR2 plasma concentrations correlated with a concordant change in arthritic activity (96% confidence interval) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to change was superior to that of sTNFR1, and other biological disease activity parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and interleukin (IL)-10 plasma concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A strong staining for TNFR2 was found in mucocutaneous lesions, where mast cells were identified as the major source for this receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study demonstrates that sTNFR2 plasma concentrations are closely linked with active BD, and especially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the expression of TNFR molecules in mast cells of mucocutaneous lesions, our results indicate a fundamental role for the TNF/TNFR pathway in BD </plain></SENT>
