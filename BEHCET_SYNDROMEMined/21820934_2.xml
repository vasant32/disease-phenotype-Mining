<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-helper-1 (Th1) counts in peripheral blood are increased in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied VDR polymorphisms in patients with these two diseases in Tunisia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 108 patients with RA, 131 patients with BD, and 152 controls, we studied FokI and BsmI VDR polymorphisms, using the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FokI polymorphism alleles and genotype were significantly more common in the RA group than in the controls (P=0.001 and P=0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FokI F allele and F/F genotype were significantly associated with BD (P=0.0003 and P=0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the group with BD, the FokI polymorphism was significantly associated with the presence of vascular manifestations (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with RA, the FokI polymorphism was significantly associated with female gender (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between the Bsm1 polymorphism and RA or BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The VDR F allele is associated with RA and BD in Tunisians </plain></SENT>
