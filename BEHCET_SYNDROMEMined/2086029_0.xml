<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>105 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e> were taken as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of the study showed that the sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria of the Zhangs was 100%, O'Duffy's 78.1%, M + B's 71.9%, Japan committees (1987)72.9%, Dilsen's 87.5%, International study group A 81.3% and B 79.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specificity of each of the above-mentioned criteria was 85.9%, 94.3%, 96.2%, 96.2%, 93.3%, 94.3% and 98.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> could be increased to 97% only if it was found together with two other major criteria during the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ocular symptoms may be 100% specificity if found together with another major criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> test was found positive in 62.2% of the BS patients but rarely seen in control patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be considered as a specific test for BS and may well be used as one of the major diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors are of the opinion that BS could be diagnosed only when 3 of the 5 major criteria, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo>, genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> and positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test are present, or if two each of the major and minor criteria are found </plain></SENT>
