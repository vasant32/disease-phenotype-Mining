<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, parenchymal neurological involvement in BD can present as a spinal cord syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085084" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neuron disease</z:e>-like presentation is extremely uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we are reporting five patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male; median age, 38) fulfilling both International Study Group criteria for BD and El Escorial criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> (ALS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were identified by a questionnaire sent to the members of the Neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> Study Group of the International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three out of five patients had only motor presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients, sensory and urinary manifestations were present as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spinal cord MRIs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, and brain MRIs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in four patients; one patient had nonspecific white matter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients passed away 1-3 years after diagnosis of ALS, and two patients were lost to follow-up 3 and 11 years after admission; one patient is still alive 3 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients that are presented here might represent a rare form of neurological involvement in BD as well as sole coincidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective series are needed to further answer this issue </plain></SENT>
