<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The origin of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the prominent features of BD is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is synthesized by endothelium, we considered it as an interesting target of investigation in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to define the level of NO in the serum of patients with BD and its relation with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As an indicator for NO, serum total <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels (end product of NO) were measured by Griess reaction in 52 consecutive patients with BD and compared with 32 age- and sex-matched healthy staff volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum NO levels of active and inactive patients were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels in patients with BD (40.25 +/- 10.51 micromol/L) were significantly higher (P &lt;.001) than those in healthy volunteers (25.09 +/- 5.33 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference in serum total <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels among patients with active BD (46.74 +/- 10.62 micromol/L) and inactive BD (33.24 +/- 3.73 micromol/L) was significant (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were observed in serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels between patients in the inactive period of BD and the control group (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased NO production might be responsible for the overall inflammatory process of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NO seems to be related to disease activity </plain></SENT>
