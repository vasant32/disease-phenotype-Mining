<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, Nd:YAG laser iridotomy was performed on eyes with secondary angle-closure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pupillary block</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment and post-treatment intraocular pressures (IOP) and the number of antiglaucoma medications were compared by Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study consisted of 16 eyes of 11 patients (2 female, 9 male, mean age 39.2+/-8.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment follow-up ranged from 6 to 36 months (mean 13.8+/-8.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean IOP was 21.6+/-2.5 mmHg on 2.5+/-0.6 medications before iridotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IOP reduced to 17.7+/-2.5 mmHg on 1+/-0.6 medications at the first month and 17.1+/-3.2 mmHg on 1.7+/-0.9 medications at the sixth month of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences between IOP and number of antiglaucoma medications at baseline and at the sixth month of the treatment was statistically significant (p&lt;0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For four eyes trabeculectomy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> and for <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> Ahmed valve implantation were performed in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nd:YAG laser iridotomy can provide reduction of IOP and the number of antiglaucoma medications in selected cases with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
