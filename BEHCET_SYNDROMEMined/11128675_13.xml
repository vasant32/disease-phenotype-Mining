<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a multisystemic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulcerations</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, that is common in the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Venous involvement is observed in 25% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> is the most common finding, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) follows it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>Hyperactivity</z:hpo> in the coagulation pathway, <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactive</z:mp> anticoagulation mechanisms, or faulty fibrinolysis generate a tendency for thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the genes involved in these pathways may cause predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Possible roles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T, factor V (FV) gene G1691A (Leiden), and prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms in venous thrombogenesis were evaluated in patients with BD; 100 healthy people, 30 BD patients without DVT, 30 BD patients with DVT, and 30 patients with idiopathic DVT were studied with the restriction fragment length polymorphism method for these 3 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of these mutations for each group, separately and in combinations, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 3 mutations, FV Leiden mutation was found to be a risk factor for DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association between FV Leiden mutation and BD was likely, but FV Leiden mutation did not increase the risk for deep venous thrombogenesis in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MTHFR gene C677T mutation does not increase risk of DVT in BD either alone or combined with FV Leiden mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although a thrombotic tendency is one of the major characteristics of BD, we found no association between these 3 thrombogenetic mutations and BD patients with thromboses </plain></SENT>
