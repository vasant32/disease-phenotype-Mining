<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood T cells from 14 patients with BD and 15 healthy controls were repeatedly stimulated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and the specific T cell response was measured by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-induced interferon-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity was examined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">chromium-51</z:chebi> release from an HLA-B51-transfected B cell line in the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A specific T cell response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM was detected in 4 patients with BD (29%) but in none of the 15 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 responders had HLA-B51 and active disease, and the specific T cell response was lost after the BD-related symptoms disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-induced T cell response was specifically inhibited by anti-HLA class I antibody or by CD8+ cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-reactive T cells recognized an HLA-B51-transfected B cell line pulsed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM or a B cell line transfected with both HLA-B51 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> in the absence of exogenous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
