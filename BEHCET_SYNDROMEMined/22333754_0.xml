<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A case report of an 18-year-old Turkish man who presented with a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> and bladder dysfunction secondary to a longitudinally extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e> as the sole presentation of NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Examination revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002313'>spastic paraparesis</z:hpo> and a T7 sensory level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple enhancing lesions throughout the thoracic cord and cerebrospinal fluid showed intense <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>neutrophilia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On further enquiry a family history of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient subsequently reported a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulceration</z:e> and intermittent occular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of NBD was made and intravenous high-dose steroids commenced with poor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the poor prognosis for functional recovery associated with spinal NBD the patient was treated with infliximab, an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha monoclonal antibody, leading to excellent recovery of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Early treatment with infliximab may facilitate a favourable functional recovery and should be considered in cases of NBD with spinal cord involvement </plain></SENT>
