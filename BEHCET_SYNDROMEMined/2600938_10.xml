<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum concentration of CA 19-9 was increased in 13 of 39 patients (33.3%) with definite or classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), in 6 of 19 patients (31.6%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), in 3 of 9 patients (33.3%) with progressive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>) and in 9 of the other 35 patients (25.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was not detected in any of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of mouse serum with patients' sera did not reduce the measured CA 19-9 values obtained by the conventional assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CA 19-9 antigen found in sera from patients with RA was present in a non-IgG fraction, and had the same molecular weight as that in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, as determined by gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that serum CA 19-9 levels were increased in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
