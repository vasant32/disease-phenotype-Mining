<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> were included in this study, 34 men and 28 women whose mean age was 33.7 (15-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (38 male and 24 female) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient and control groups were questioned about any history of audio-vestibular disturbance and underwent physical and ENT examination and the following audiologic tests: pure tone audiometric test (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 kHz), tympanogram, speech discrimination, short increment sensitivity index, tone-decay test, auditory brainstem response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vestibular system was evaluated by videonistagmogram and caloric test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial and brainstem magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) of patients who have vestibular disturbances were practiced to examine the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the patient and the control groups were tested with the HLA-B51 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pure tone audiogram showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018784" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory-neural hearing loss</z:e> (25 dB hearing level in at least two frequencies) in 20 of the 62 (32%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients while the control group were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a hearing loss involving high frequencies in the audiograms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients with hearing disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recruitment investigation tests and auditory brain stem response confirmed cochlear involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Caloric stimulation tests revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vestibular function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In electronystagmography, 21 (34%) patients had hypometric or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007338'>hypermetric saccades</z:hpo> and smooth pursuit tests showing that 4 (6%) patients had pathological changes while the control group was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 antigen was found positive in 15 of 20 Behcet's patient with hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: (1) The hearing and vestibular disturbances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> is more prevalent than previously recognized; (2) Hearing loss in high frequencies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients is an indicator of cochlear involvement in this disease; (3) There is a higher prevalence of central vestibular syndrome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients than it was thought before; (4) HLA-B51 antigen may be able to be a prognostic factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients </plain></SENT>
