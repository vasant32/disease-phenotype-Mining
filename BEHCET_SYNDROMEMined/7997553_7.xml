<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest radiographs and CT scans of nine patients with thoracic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Radiographs of the nine patients showed mediastinal widening in five (56%), air-space consolidation in five (56%), and lung mass in three (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT scans of the nine patients showed that mediastinal widening was due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in four (44%) or narrowing of the superior vena cava in one [11%], which caused mediastinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>; that air-space consolidation (seen on both radiographs and CT scans) was due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> or infarction in five (56%); and that lung mass was due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right or left pulmonary artery in three (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, CT scans showed hyperinflation in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chest radiographic findings of thoracic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome are variable and nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT can be helpful in the assessment of the syndrome by showing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior vena cava and characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the pulmonary arteries </plain></SENT>
