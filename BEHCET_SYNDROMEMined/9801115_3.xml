<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To establish the urologic status of men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e>, because studies assessing the urologic aspect of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 2.5-year period, we evaluated 104 male patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, 16 to 50 years old (mean 31+/-7), using a urologic questionnaire and modified Boyarsky symptom score; 44 healthy men, 20 to 46 years old (mean 29+/-7), were used as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000031'>epididymitis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome was 19.2% in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean irritative symptom score was 1.22+/-1.37 (significantly higher than the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100518'>dysuria</z:hpo>, urgency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000017'>nocturia</z:hpo>, terminal dribbling, and intermittency) was significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000031'>epididymitis</z:hpo> in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> was much higher than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because some lower urinary tract symptoms were significantly more frequent in these patients, we conclude that screening of such patients with urologic questionnaire and symptom scoring is essential to identify those who need further urologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
