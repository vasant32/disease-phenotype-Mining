<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The etiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is unknown; however, familial aggregation studies indicate a strong genetic background and a complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Association of HLA-B51 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is regarded as being the strongest evidence of genetic contribution described to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A low rate of recombination was observed within the telomeric end of the major histocompatibility complex up to the HFE gene, which causes hereditary <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that the telomere of 6p may harbor a susceptibility gene for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 28 multicase families of Turkish origin was ascertained, and 78 of the 183 available family members were diagnosed as having <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the analysis of the telomeric region adjacent to HLA-B, we used a panel of 20 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers between D6S273 and D6S470, covering a region of approximately 36 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis using GeneHunter 2.0 software revealed a broad peak of linkage, with the highest Z score of 4.11 at position D6S285, which is approximately 17 cM telomeric to HLA-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This significant linkage finding may indicate a second susceptibility locus in the telomere of chromosome 6p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identification of this putative susceptibility gene could help to further understand the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
