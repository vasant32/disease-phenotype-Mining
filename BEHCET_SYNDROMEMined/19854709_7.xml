<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients before and after anti-TNF therapy were analysed by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) quantitative proteomic analysis and further validated by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 326 proteins identified by proteomic analysis, increased serum levels of leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) was identified in RA patients before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum LRG concentrations were significantly elevated in RA patients compared with healthy controls and decreased after anti-TNF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, serum LRG concentrations correlated with disease activity in RA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in a subpopulation of patients with active CD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> C-reactive protein levels, serum LRG concentrations were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LRG represents a novel serum biomarker for monitoring disease activity during therapy in autoimmune patients, particularly useful in patients with active disease but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CRP levels </plain></SENT>
