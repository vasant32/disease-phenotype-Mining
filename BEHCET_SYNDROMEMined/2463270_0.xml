<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for HC ranged from between 0.30 mg/l in saliva and 11.7 mg/l in blood plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HC-IgA complex has a greater range, from undetectable concentrations (urine, colostrum, and cervical mucus) up to 59.2 mg/l in blood plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Undetectable concentrations of HC-IgA complex were also shown in serum from patients with IgA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> and in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased concentrations of HC were noted in bronchoalveolar fluid from a patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp>, serum from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e>, and in synovial fluid from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000934'>chondrocalcinosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the concentrations of HC-IgA complex were raised only in those patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>pulmonary alveolar proteinosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
