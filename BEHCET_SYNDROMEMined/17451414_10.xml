<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, relapsing, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of unknown aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The involvement of oral mucosal surfaces represents the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> feature of the disease in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of BD patients and then compare with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined the relationship between the periodontal condition and the clinical severity of the disease in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-six patients with BD, 63 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and 82 healthy subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The periodontal status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was evaluated according to the community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD patients were also assessed for clinical severity score (CSS) as described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CPITN were observed to be higher in BD patients (1.79 +/- 0.96) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients (1.22 +/- 0.87) and healthy controls (1.18 +/- 0.98) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a positive association between CSS and CPITN (p=0.017) in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed that periodondal status is worse in BD patients and associated with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We can speculate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> may induce a systemic inflammatory process that may contribute to the development and/or progression of BD </plain></SENT>
