<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the CsA blood levels and the levels of nondialyzable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18095">Hypro</z:chebi> indicated a reciprocal relationship, especially at blood levels of CsA higher than 600 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of gingival sections from CsA-treated patients showed swelling of the epithelial cells, formation of perinuclear clear zones, widening of intercellular gaps and formation of several basal cell layers </plain></SENT>
