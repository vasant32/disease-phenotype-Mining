<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found a higher risk for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> gene, 46 kb centromeric of HLA-B, by investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e> repetitive polymorphism within exon 5 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic gene causing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, however, has remained uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, eight polymorphic microsatellite markers, distributed over a 900-kb region surrounding the HLA-B locus, were subjected to association analysis for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical studies of associated alleles detected on each microsatellite locus showed that the pathogenic gene for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is most likely found within a 46-kb segment between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> and HLA-B genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this mapping study, and the results of an earlier study of ours, suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> is a strong candidate gene for the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
