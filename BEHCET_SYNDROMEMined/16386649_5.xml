<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased expressions of VEGF have been observed in the active stage and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of the VEGF gene have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate whether polymorphisms on the regulatory region of the VEGF gene are associated with susceptibility of Korean patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred one native Korean patients with BD and 138 healthy unrelated controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genotype and allele frequencies of the four selected polymorphisms (-2578, -1154, -634, and 936) were not different between the BD group and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the BD patients, the frequency of the -634 CC genotype decreased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (2.6% vs. 20.6%, adjusted OR = 0.100, 95% CI 0.011-0.875, p = 0.037), although it became insignificant after correction for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the VEGF gene polymorphisms are not associated with BD in the Korean population, but they may be involved in the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> of BD </plain></SENT>
