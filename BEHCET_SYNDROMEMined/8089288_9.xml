<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No standard therapy has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its cause is presumed to be <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> or immunologic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease benefit from interferon, which has antiviral, immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and antitumoral properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients were initially given 3 MU interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously three times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The doses were gradually increased to 12 MU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient received a total dose of 216 MU during the 2-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therapy with 9 MU interferon alfa-2a once a month was continued in half the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were observed before and after treatment for 6-month periods, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were symptom free by the end of the 2-month treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> as well as pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> decreased significantly in the posttreatment period as compared with the pretreatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data suggest that interferon treatment appears to be effective for patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>��et's disease </plain></SENT>
