<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The new microemulsion preconcentrate (MEPC) formulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> has been developed to reduce problems in intestinal absorption and to stabilize fluctuations in blood levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multicenter, open-label clinical trial of MEPC was conducted to assess its efficacy and safety in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient population comprised 17 de novo patients (patients not previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> in the currently available formulation) and 30 patients whose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> formulation was switched from the conventional formulation to MEPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with the test formulation for 16 weeks in the former (de novo) group and for 12 weeks in the latter (switched) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the de novo group, ocular attacks decreased significantly as compared to the pretreatment incidence in 11 of the 14 patients (78.6%) evaluated after MEPC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ocular attacks also decreased significantly in the switched group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the de novo group, visual acuity improved with MEPC therapy in 20 of the 28 eyes (71.4%) examined, and the overall efficacy evaluation was "improved" or "markedly improved" in 13 of the 16 patients evaluated (81.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The one case each of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease observed in the de novo group were regarded as adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> MEPC is useful for controlling the ocular symptoms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and that it can be used as effectively and safely as the conventional formulation </plain></SENT>
