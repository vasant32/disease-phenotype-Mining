<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of interferon alpha-2a (IFN-alpha2a) in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, refractory to steroids and conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were included after a major relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha2a (3 million units three times a week) was administered subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed by improvement in visual acuity, decrease in vitreous haze, resolution of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, assessed by fundus examination and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, and decrease in oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 45 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 32.3 years (range 8-58) and sex ratio (F/M) was 0.66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in 23 cases (51.1%) and with other entities in 22 cases (48.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> before interferon therapy was 34.9 months (range 3.4-168.7) and an average of 3.26 relapses following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was controlled in 82.6% of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 59% of patients with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 29.6 months (range 14-55), median oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> threshold decreased significantly from 23.6 mg/day (range 16-45) to 10 mg/d (range 4-14) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interferon was discontinued in 10 patients (22.2%) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and in four patients without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred in four and one cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interferon therapy appears to be an efficient strategy in severe and relapsing forms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease but also in other uveitic entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, it seems to act more to suspend rather than cure the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, IFN-alpha2a may be proposed as a secondline strategy after failure of conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
