<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the clinical features and visual outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical charts of 227 consecutive patients (414 eyes) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> who were seen in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> Clinic of Taipei Veterans General Hospital were reviewed: 96 patients (group A) between 1984 and 1993 and 131 (group B) between 1994 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 30.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Males were most affected in the 3rd and 4th decades and females in the 2nd to 5th decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were more skin and gastrointestinal lesions in males, and less skin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0744369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital lesions</z:e> in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 antigen was found in 35.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with cyclosporin, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was more frequent in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> occurred bilaterally in 83.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the first visit, potential visual acuity (VA) was 0.1 or less in 24.7% of eyes in males and 11.4% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean time from presentation to loss of useful vision (&gt; 0.1) was 51 months in 19.1% of eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated the risks of losing useful vision at 5, 10 and 15 years as being 22.6%, 43.0% and 58.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>VA at the first and last visits were better and VA deterioration slower in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Visual outcome is poorer in males than in females and has improved in the recent decade, but still a significant proportion of patients lose their vision quickly </plain></SENT>
