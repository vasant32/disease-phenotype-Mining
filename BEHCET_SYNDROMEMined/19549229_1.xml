<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>Recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) presents a diagnostic problem in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), particularly when it occurs as the only or earliest feature of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there have been only a few reports studying the differences in characteristics between <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the clinical differences between <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and BD using a large group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out, analysing demographic data, the clinical features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo>, and the major and minor symptoms of BD of 1643 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and 3527 patients with BD presenting from 1995 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BD had a greater female predominance, and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were significantly more common in BD than in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Involvement of multiple sites was also more common in BD than in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and the menstrual cycle had more influence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in patients with BD (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor symptoms such as articular, neurological and vascular symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000031'>epididymitis</z:hpo> were also seen more often in BD than in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001), and in particularly, patients with BD had a significantly higher frequency of articular symptoms than did patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings may provide guidelines for the clinical differentiation between <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with multiple major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e>, particularly with articular symptoms, should be closely followed up for the development of BD, and the possibility of other diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> should also be considered </plain></SENT>
