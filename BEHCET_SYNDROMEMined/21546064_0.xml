<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case is reported of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome complicated by pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that responded to anti-TNF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is accompanied by a literature review of previously published cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched the English language medical literature using the PubMed and Medline search terms: "<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's," "Pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>," and "infliximab," "etanercept," or "adalimumab." RESULTS: A 43-year-old man with a 6-month history of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> developed arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the common carotid and common iliac arteries and thromboses in a femoral vein and pulmonary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with high-dose oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and pulsed intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was initiated but while on treatment he developed pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His treatment was changed to intravenous infliximab with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> to which he showed a good response with marked clinical improvement, reduction in his inflammatory markers, and regression of the pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The review of the literature identified 3 reported cases of treatment of pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome with anti-TNF therapy, with good outcomes in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>Pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> are important complications of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-TNF inhibitors should be considered in patients who do not respond to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
