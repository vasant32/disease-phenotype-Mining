<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty cases of BD and 14 healthy volunteers were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of Lp(a) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi> were measured according to the method of Benjamin and Vallence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, BD patients had significantly lower concentrations of serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi>, and significantly higher concentrations of Serum Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher levels of serum Lp(a) were observed in patients with vascular complications, while significantly lower levels of serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi> were found during disease activity and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum like lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) may contribute to the increased incidence of vascular complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi> can be considered as a marker of disease activity that may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
