<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By 2 different techniques directed motility was found to be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This increase was largely due to the subgroup of patients with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Counts of absolute numbers of cells migrating highlighted this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in the phagocytic or adherent properties of PMN in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased PMN motility in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome may contribute to the expression of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It remains to be tested whether altered PMN motility in this syndrome is genetically linked </plain></SENT>
