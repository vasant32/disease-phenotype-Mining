<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systemic immuno-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> affecting multiple organs with generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the aetiology is still unknown, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is one of the most prominent features in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction (SPR) is a non-specific hyperreactive lesion formation that is one of the major features and diagnostic criteria of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It develops after 24-48 h at the site of the needle-prick, especially in the exacerbation period, and it is very similar to the erythematous papules or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>pustules</z:mpath> that appear spontaneously in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an investigation into the formation of the SPR lesion may contribute to the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of this unique disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immunological features of SPR formation by assessing the immunohistochemical staining of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and endothelial growth factor markers such as E-selectin, P-selectin and endoglin (CD 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome showing positive (n = 15) or negative (n = 10) SPR and 15 age- and sex-matched hospital-based healthy control subjects from a similar ethnic background were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into active and inactive stage by clinical findings and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactant parameters including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Punch biopsy specimens were obtained both from the lesion site on the forearms at 48 h and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin approximately 5 cm adjacent to the SPR site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A biopsy was also obtained from the test application site in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome patients with negative SPR and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were then evaluated by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate around the vessels and skin appendages that extended somewhat into the deep dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A positive segmental staining of E-selectin and P-selectin was noted in the endothelial cells of biopsies obtained from the patients with positive SPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A positive segmental staining of CD 105 in the endothelial cells was also observed in the same group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the immunostaining of the same markers was found to be negative in the biopsies obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin of SPR-positive patients, SPR-negative patients and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactant levels were significantly higher in the active stage than in inactive patients or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interaction of cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules together with endothelial proliferation may play an important role in the formation of SPR lesions in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The involvement of the vascular endothelium in a large number of diseases including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome supports the importance of vascular-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules for their aetiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
