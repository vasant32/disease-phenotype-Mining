<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a significant increase in the proportion of cytophilic IgA1 was found in circulating CD8 and CD4 cells (P less than 0.01), with a corresponding decrease in IgA-Fc receptors on these T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 30-40% of the cytophilic IgA1 on T cells may have been of the polymeric secretory type and the rest of the monomeric variety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgA isotype of B cells was also significantly increased (P less than 0.001), without an overall change in circulating B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a surprising finding was the significant up-regulation of gamma delta T cell receptor in the CD8 (P less than 0.01) in the absence of a change in the proportion of alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36018">beta T</z:chebi> cell receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that some common microbial antigen might initiate at the mucosal surface an immune defence reaction characterized by T cells with gamma delta receptors and IgA-specific B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, IgA1 bound to circulating T cells may down-regulate the central T cell function </plain></SENT>
