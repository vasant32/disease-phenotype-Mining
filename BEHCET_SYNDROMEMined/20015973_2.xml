<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report the use of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>-patch therapy on active mucocutaneous lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five BD ex-smoker patients with refractory active mucocutaneous manifestations were treated with <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> patches for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four out of five patients quickly responded to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>-patch therapy and experienced a complete regression of mucocutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other manifestations of BD did not respond and new manifestations appeared during this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had no benefit from therapy but on restarting smoking it was promptly effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous lesions associated with BD may be modulated by smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both smoking and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>-replacement therapy may be efficacious not only on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e>, but also on other mucocutaneous manifestations, whereas the efficacy in the treatment and prevention of other systemic manifestations of BD is not proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At least in ex-smokers, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> in its pure form is well tolerated and its use could be justified in selected cases of BD with predominant and recurrent refractory mucocutaneous manifestations </plain></SENT>
