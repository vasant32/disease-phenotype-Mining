<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the reactivity of serum anti-alpha-enolase antibodies in BD and in other rheumatologic diseases, and to evaluate the clinical significance of serum anti-alpha-enolase antibodies in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting were used to examine serum samples from patients with BD (n=100), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) (n=50), systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (n=21), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) (n=20), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (n=20), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> (n=17), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>) (n=11), and samples from healthy volunteer donors (n=23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical records of patients with BD were reviewed to investigate their clinical characteristics.RESULTS: Specific positive signals against recombinant human alpha-enolase were detected by IgM ELISA of serum samples from 56 of the 100 BD patients (56.0%), 24 of the 50 SLE patients (48.0%), 15 of the 21 systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> patients (71.4%), 13 of the 20 RA patients (65.0%), 10 of the 20 Takayasu's <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> patients (50.0%), 9 of the 17 dermatomyositis patients (52.9%), and 5 of the 11 MCTD patients (45.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of BD patients with vascular lesions was significantly higher in the anti-alpha-enolase antibody positive group than in the negative group (p=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the reactivities of serum anti-alpha-enolase antibodies in BD and other rheumatologic diseases with moderate specificity and also found that serum anti-alpha-enolase antibodies in BD can be associated with vascular system involvement </plain></SENT>
