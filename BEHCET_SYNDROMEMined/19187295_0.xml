<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop tools as reliable as IL-8 levels in defining BD severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 32 patients with BD and 16 healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory investigations and measurement of serum IL-8 levels were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified as groups I and II based on the serum IL-8 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were then reassigned to groups based on the predictions through discriminating analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In addition to the differences between patient and control groups, the differences between groups I and II, group I and controls, and group II and controls were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discriminating analysis results showed that the patients had been assigned to groups I and II with 100% accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Discriminating analysis using clinical and routine laboratory findings indicated that 100% of the patients were accurately assigned to the same groups as their IL-8 levels indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the classification made according to discriminating analysis using these routine variables is a reliable method in determination of the disease severity </plain></SENT>
