<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet syndrome</z:e> (SS), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, has clinical and laboratory features similar to those of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are elevated in patients with SS, and exogenous administration of G-CSF has repeatedly been implicated in the causation of SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is a hematopoietic growth factor that regulates the production and differentiation of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To clarify the role of elevated serum G-CSF levels in patients with active SS and active BD compared with those with inactive SS or BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To then analyze neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the active state of SS and BD; and to also investigate the influence of autologous serum on neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum G-CSF was examined in 5 patients with active SS, 7 with inactive SS, 7 with active BD, 9 with inactive BD, and 5 healthy controls by means of an enzyme immunoassay kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We measured apoptotic cells in the neutrophil fraction of peripheral blood collections in patients with active diseases and controls by means of flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum G-CSF level was significantly higher in patients with active SS than in those with inactive SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in serum G-CSF levels among patients with active and inactive BD was also significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum G-CSF level was significantly higher in patients with active SS than in those with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was significantly higher in patients with active SS than healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> rate was also seen in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increased rate of neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was significantly suppressed when the neutrophils were cultured for 18 hours in the presence of autologous active SS serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similarly, neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was suppressed in the presence of autologous serum in patients with active BD, but not significantly so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased production of G-CSF in patients with SS and BD may play an important role in the manifestation of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Given the suppression of neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the active state in the presence of the influence of autologous serum, which includes elevated G-CSF level, we propose that serum G-CSF plays a significant role in the suppression of neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, G-CSF-induced suppression of neutrophil <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> appears to be deeply involved in the pathogenesis of SS and BD </plain></SENT>
