<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were in a state of hypercoagulation and hyperfibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vascular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in particular, coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters appeared to be indices of vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the multimeric structure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) revealed a tendency for large multimer of vWF to increase in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with accompanying vascular complications, whereas such increase were not observed in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease without any vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, analysis of vWF multimeric structure and the determination of coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters in plasma appear to be useful indicators of vascular complications in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
