<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a multisystem vasculopathy of unknown cause with variable clinical presentation and the outcome of current treatments is often unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence for T-cell autoreactivity in BD and this study explores the therapeutic response to lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> with a humanized anti-CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with active BD received a single course of 134 mg of CAMPATH-1H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressives were withdrawn and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> reduced according to clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment response was assessed by remission of clinical features of disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> dose, the need for subsequent immunosuppressives and disease relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By 6 months, 13/18 (72%) had entered remission and average, daily <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> dose was reduced from 17.7 to 6.7 mg/day (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At patient follow-up after 37 (6-60) months, seven had relapsed after an average of 25 months, five had required the introduction of an immunosuppressive drug and two had been retreated with CAMPATH-1H; 10 were in stable remission and six were receiving no therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate infusion-related adverse effects occurred in five and two developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Circulating CD4+ T cells fell to low levels after CAMPATH-1H and remained depressed for at least 1 yr; no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic response to CAMPATH-1H suggests a central role for autoreactive lymphocytes in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The potential of CAMPATH-1H to induce sustained treatment-free remission in BD poorly controlled by conventional therapy requires further evaluation </plain></SENT>
