<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adamantiadis-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is a chronically progressing multisystemic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying disease mechanism is an obliterative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Main clinical symptoms are oral and genital aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammations</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cutaneous, rheumatoid, neural, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular manifestations may be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is based on clinical features since currently no specific laboratory tests or pathognomonic histopathological features are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ocular changes may provide important diagnostic clues to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective fashion 196 patients of the Department of Ophthalmology of the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg between 1988 and 1998 with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> seen by fluorescence angiography were evaluated according to the diagnostic criteria of the "<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Research Committee of Japan" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 196 patients there were 12 patients with Adamantiadis-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apart from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, angiographic features included capillary dropout in 64% (9/14), swelling of the optic disc in 79% (11/14) and irregularly delayed areolar filling of choriocapillaris in the early phase of fluorescence angiography in 43% (6/14) of eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant relationship between severity of the systemic disorder and the activity of the ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Apart from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, 43% of eyes in patients with Adamantiadis-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease presented a delayed choroidal filling in fluorescence angiography as a sign of choroidal involvement of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed leakage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> from the optic disc, which could be due to a secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the ciliary circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory involvement predominantly of choroidal vessels, as visualized in fluorescence angiography, may be a diagnostic lead in Adamantiadis-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
