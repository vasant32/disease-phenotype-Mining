<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular involvement may be seen in 25-50% of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the characteristics of vascular involvement in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eighty patients with BD were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of vascular involvement was made on clinical signs, by Doppler ultrasonography and/or angiography using computed tomographic or magnetic resonance techniques where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical characteristics were recorded for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (39.4%) had vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with vascular lesions, the frequency of male sex was significantly higher than in patients without vascular lesions (89.8% vs. 63.3%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 71 BD patients with vascular involvement, 68 had venous lesions (95.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had arterial lesions without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had arterial involvement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent type of vascular involvement was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the lower extremities (n = 56, 78.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (r = 0.325, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (33.8%) had vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and two had vena hepatica <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with vascular involvement, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum was significantly higher (p = 0.001) and the frequency of ocular involvement was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than in patients without vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates the frequency and significance of vascular involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
