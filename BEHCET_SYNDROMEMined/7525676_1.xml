<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that G-CSF and GM-CSF, a family of hematopoietic growth factors, enhance PMN activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the role of these two CSFs in BD, we first examined the chemotactic response of PMNs to these CSFs by performing a polarization assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PMN response to G-CSF in BD patients was lower than that in controls, while PMN response to GM-CSF was similar in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, PMNs from BD patients showed an enhanced chemotactic response to N-formyl-L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32648">methionyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi>-phenylalanine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is speculated that the PMNs of the patients might have already been activated in vivo by G-CSF and thus could not respond further to this agent in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined G-CSF and GM-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions in peripheral mononuclear cells stimulated with LPS, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, and Con A by Northern hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in BD patients were higher than in the controls, while GM-CSF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were lower than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also examined the serum levels of the two CSFs by ELISA and EIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of the two CSFs in both patients and controls were not detectable, except in the case of one BD patient in the active stage of the disease, who showed high levels of G-CSF, but not of GM-CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
