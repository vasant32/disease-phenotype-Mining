<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (12 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu's disease</z:e> and three with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease) underwent various surgical procedures, depending on the pathological changes in the aortic valve and the aortic root and on the degree of involvement of the coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients had coronary artery involvement alone and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 3); group 2 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> with an intact coronary artery and underwent AVR or a modified Bentall procedure (n = 7); and group 3 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> with coronary artery involvement and underwent AVR, a modified Bentall procedure, or translocation with CABG (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prosthetic valve or composite graft with a <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> felt flange at the sewing ring was fabricated during surgery by exact measurement of the sizes of the aortic annulus and distal aorta and treatment with fibrin glue before insertion </plain></SENT>
