<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bull., 23, 519-522 (2000)), high levels of a truncated actin with an N-terminus of Met-44 were detected in neutrophils of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the increase of the truncated actin in neutrophils of patients may be important for understanding the pathology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, the mechanism of the truncated actin formation was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, to investigate the presence of a specific protease, which cleaves the actin at the site between Val-43 and Met-44, a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with a partial amino acid sequence of actin from the N-terminal Pro-38 to Asp-51 was synthesized as the protease substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synthesized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was digested with cytosolic fractions of neutrophils from patients and healthy volunteers, and digestion products were analyzed by C18-reverse phase HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chromatograms of these samples showed that an endoprotease, which cleaved the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> at a specific site, was present in cytosolic fractions of neutrophils from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, the effects of various kinds of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> on the digestion of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were investigated in order to identify the responsible endoprotease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The digestion of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was suppressed by 4-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>) benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, a serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>) and N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethylketone (CMK, a polymorphonuclear (PMN)-elastase inhibitor) in the presence of EDTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PMN-elastase was found to cleave the substrate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and actin at the site between Val-43 and Met-44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results lead to the conclusion that the PMN-elastase is responsible for cleavage of actin at the N-terminal site between Val-43 and Met-44 in neutrophils from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
