<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of structural ocular complications and loss of visual acuity (VA) in cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) and to evaluate potential risk and protective factors for these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 168 consecutive patients with BD-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> treated at five academic center <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> subspecialty practices were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data for these patients were ascertained by standardized chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures included VA, structural ocular complications of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and intraocular pressure (IOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 1.05 years, the incidence of specific structural complications and IOP disturbances were common: the incidence rate of any ocular complication was 0.45 per eye-year (EY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of loss of VA to 20/50 or worse and to 20/200 or worse were 0.12 per EY and 0.09 per EY, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for loss of VA during follow-up were persistent inflammatory activity, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152253" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior synechiae</z:e>, presence of hypotony, and presence of elevated IOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a time-dependent analysis, current activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of loss of VA to 20/50 or worse (relative risk [RR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 5.5; P = .03) and to 20/200 or worse (RR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.8; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss of VA and occurrence of ocular complications were common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> associated with BD, even with aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ongoing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> during follow-up, presence or occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152253" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior synechiae</z:e>, hypotony, and elevated IOP were associated with an increased risk of loss of VA </plain></SENT>
