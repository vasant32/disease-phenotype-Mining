<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Oxidative burst and phagocytosis of neutrophils were evaluated by flow cytometry in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (n = 32), inflammatory (n = 17) and healthy controls (n = 14), in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>, AG and SNAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The stimulation index of oxidative burst was found to be significantly decreased following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> stimulation in patients with active BD compared to inflammatory and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxidative function of neutrophils were inhibited in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>, AG and SNAP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi> inhibited the oxidative burst of neutrophils obtained from healthy controls more than inflammatory controls and BD (80% vs 52% and 53% respectively, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference of phagocytosis inhibition was found with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>, AG and SNAP and there were also no differences between the groups (% 9-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">Nitric oxide donors</z:chebi> and inhibitors may have a therapeutic role in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease by suppresing neutrophil activity </plain></SENT>
