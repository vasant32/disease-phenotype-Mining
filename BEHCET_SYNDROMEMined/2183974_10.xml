<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and even specific in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease from Turkey, Japan, and Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A lack of positive reaction to this test has been reported in British and American patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the specificity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test's results in Israeli patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, we compared their prevalence in these patients to that in a group of patients with other diseases associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-six Jewish and Arab Israeli patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, during a period of peak activity of their disease, and forty-six patients with other diseases associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, were studied for the hyperreactivity phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive reaction was observed in forty-five of forty-six patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, while the test gave negative results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates, therefore, that the results of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test are highly sensitive and specific for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Israeli patients </plain></SENT>
