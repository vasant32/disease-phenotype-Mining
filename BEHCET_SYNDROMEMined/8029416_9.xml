<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1978 and 1993, 31 pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were diagnosed in 15 consecutive male patients, aged 21-56 years (mean, 32 years 5 months), with known <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were assessed at chest radiography (n = 15), computed tomography (n = 14), angiography (n = 10), and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients had single and 12 had multiple pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were associated with pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up chest radiography revealed five subjects with progression leading to fatal rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and two subjects with regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and cessation of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravenous digital subtraction angiography was the procedure of choice in the documentation of pulmonary arterial involvement, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was most helpful in the presumptive diagnosis of occluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The appearance of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> represents a poor prognosis in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, but there is a chance that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> will not rupture </plain></SENT>
