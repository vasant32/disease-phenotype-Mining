<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were documented in 24 Behçet's patients during a period of 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were male, ranging in age from 20 to 53 years (mean, 35 +/- 7.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of disease was 9 +/- 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were nine abdominal aorta, four iliac, three common femoral, five superficial femoral, four popliteal, one subclavian, one carotid, and one posterior tibial artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in one patient an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developed from the arterialized venous conduit that had been inserted for a common femoral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients were already under immunosuppressive therapy for ocular problems at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients received immunosuppressive therapy after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We performed one abdominal aneurysmorrhaphy, two iliac artery <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> graft interpositions, two aortobiliac bypasses (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>), six aortic tube graft (three <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>, three Dacron) interpositions, one avrtofemoral bypass (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>), two iliofemoral bypasses (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>), two superficial femoral artery graft (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) interpositions, and three popliteal graft interpositions (one <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>, two vein graft) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also as an initial procedure one carotid, one subclavian, four superficial femoral, one popliteal, and one posterior tibial artery were ligated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients were followed up for a mean duration of 47.3 +/- 27 months (range, 1 to 108 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient with a subclavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> died of massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> on postoperative day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> group one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> 4 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Another patient from the same group died 5 years after operation without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the common femoral artery group the patient with an occluded iliofemoral graft died of an exsanguinating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysm</z:hpo> in the first year after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were five anastomotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, after the initial operation two iliofemoral, one aortofemoral, and one popliteal interposition graft were occluded without disabling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> limited to the extremities could be ligated without disabling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
