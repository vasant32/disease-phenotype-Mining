<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to define the expression on CD3+ T cells of six chemokine receptors associated with inflammatory sites and the expression of intracellular cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to detect chemokine receptor and intracytoplasmic cytokines' expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed that CD3+ T cells in the peripheral blood express a restricted array of inflammatory chemokine receptors, specifically, CCR5, CCR6 and CXCR3, but little CCR1-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest expression of CXCR3 on CD3+ T cells is associated with the presence of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) manifestations or pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CXCR3 is the principal inflammatory chemokine receptor involved in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCR5 chemokine receptor is increased in BD regardless of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells expressing CXCR3+ CD3+ cells is significantly increased in patients with BD compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-4-producing cells are decreased in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the predominance of type 1 cytokine producing cells in CXCR3+ CD3+ T cells during BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that CXCR3 is the principal inflammatory chemokine receptor involved in BD, particularly during <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and pulmonary manifestations </plain></SENT>
