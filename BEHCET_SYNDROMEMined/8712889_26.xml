<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of the first 1000 patients with BS were reviewed retrospectively for past or present history of diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The past and present history of diarrhoea was also elicited prospectively among 147 consecutive patients with BS and 78 diseased controls (42 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, 17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, seven with seronegative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">spondylarthropathy</z:e>, and 12 with miscellaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory mucosal changes were sought in rectal biopsy specimens from 75 patients with BS, 47 diseased controls (29 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo>, eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, six with familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e>), and 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In chart review there were only seven <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with diarrhoea; none of them had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the prospective survey there were no significant differences between the BS and control groups in the past and present history of diarrhoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the rectal mucosal histology between patients with BS and controls, while patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> showed pronounced differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> is not common in BS patients from Turkey </plain></SENT>
