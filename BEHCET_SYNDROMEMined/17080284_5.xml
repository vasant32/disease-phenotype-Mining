<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positive rate in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to evaluate whether anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody expression is associated with clinical findings at diagnosis and clinical course of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred six patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 30 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and 45 healthy control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody was detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody expression, the various parameters at diagnosis, cumulative relapse rates, and cumulative probabilities of operation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positive rate was 44.3 percent in intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 3.3 percent in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and 8.8 percent in healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, age, gender, distribution of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease subtype, symptoms, laboratory tests, and colonoscopic findings at diagnosis were not different according to anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative probability of a first operation was significantly higher in anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (+) intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (-) intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease: 44.8 and 17.2 percent at one year, and 53 and 24.3 percent at two years after diagnosis, respectively (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of patients who underwent two or more operations was higher in anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (+) intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (-) intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (21.3 vs. 8.5 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative relapse rates were not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positive rate was 44.3 percent in intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings at diagnosis and cumulative relapse rates of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were not found to be associated with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, patients with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (+) intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were more likely to receive surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
