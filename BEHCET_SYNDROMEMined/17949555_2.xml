<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Basic and clinical studies have revealed a strong correlation between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9, and the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, previous studies have clearly shown that MMP-2 and MMP-9 play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e>, temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depending on those findings, we hypothesized that circulating MMP-2 and MMP-9 could be useful markers to demonstrate vascular aneurysmatic involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with BD, and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the disease activity of patients according to the Leeds activity score system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the Leeds activity scores of patients with their serum levels of MMP2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD were categorized as active (total activity score &gt; or = 5) or inactive (total activity score &lt; 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were further categorized with respect to their extent of involvement as muco-cutaneous or systemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with systemic involvement were subdivided into ocular or vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with vascular involvement were subgrouped as thrombotic or aneurysmatic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum MMP-9 but not MMP-2 levels were significantly higher both in patients with active and inactive disease as compared to healthy controls (p = 0.008 and 0.013 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found positive correlation between Leeds activity score and serum MMP-2 levels in patients with vascular involvement (p = 0.035 and r = 0.485), and serum MMP-9 levels in active BD patients (p = 0.003 and r = 0.599) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in patients with systemic involvement were higher than those of healthy controls but not patients with mucocutaneous involvement (p = 0.046 and 0.002 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of MMP-2 in patients with vascular involvement were found to be higher than those of healthy controls and patients with mucocutaneous involvement (p = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively) but not different in those with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of MMP-9 in patients with vascular involvement were found to be higher than those of healthy controls and ocular disease (p = 0.001 and 0.033 respectively) but not different in those with mucocutaneous involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of MMP-2 in patients with aneurysmatic involvement were found to be higher than those of healthy controls, mucocutaneous and ocular involvement (p = 0.004, 0.008 and 0.004 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of MMP-2 in patients with thrombotic involvement were found to be higher than those of healthy controls and mucocutaneous (p = 0.018 and 0.033 respectively) but not ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of MMP-9 in patients with aneurysmatic involvement were found to be higher than those of healthy controls, mucocutaneous and ocular involvement (p = 0.001, 0.048 and 0.007 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of MMP-9 in patients with thrombotic involvement were found to be higher than those of healthy controls but not mucocutaneous and ocular involvement (p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that serum MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels can be used as an activity indicator for vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's or active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>But they can not be used as a marker reflecting the systemic involvement of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The systemic expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were strongly associated with vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, particularly aneurysmatic involvement, suggesting their pathogenetic roles in vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
