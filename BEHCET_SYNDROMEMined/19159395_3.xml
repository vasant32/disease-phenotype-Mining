<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine, by counting sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN) frequencies, whether DNA damage have an effect on the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our aim was to show if there is an association between <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and chromosome instability in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed lymphocytes from patients with BD (16 in active and 14 in inactive periods) and 20 healthy controls for SCE and MN frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) level, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) level, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) count were determined in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SCE and MN frequencies were significantly higher in both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p &lt; 0.00001, p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively), and the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level was significantly higher in both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly lower in both the active and inactive period patients than in the controls (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increased plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level and decreased plasma GSH-Px and SOD levels reflect the increased levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in BD patients, and this situation may impair genetic stability in BD patients </plain></SENT>
