<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> had phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation between September 2008 and March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyzed were the corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), full-field electroretinogram (ERG) results, intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, extraocular manifestations, and complications before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one men (26 eyes) and 6 women (10 eyes) <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no postoperative complications, although a mild to moderate anterior chamber reaction occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the last visit, the CDVA was improved in 35 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven eyes (75%) achieved a final CDVA of 0.1 or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No female patient had obvious fundus complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> female patients achieved a final CDVA of 0.25 or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The common causes for poor visual prognosis were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the retina, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eyes with marked ERG a-wave and b-wave abnormalities had a significantly worse postoperative CDVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven (10 eyes) of 8 patients (11 eyes) with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum had a postoperative visual acuity below 0.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease can be safely and successfully performed in quiet eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A poor visual prognosis was associated with male sex, severe fundus complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum and could be predicted by ERG abnormalities </plain></SENT>
