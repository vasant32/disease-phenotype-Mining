<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is released by activated T lymphocytes and macrophages and up-regulates the proinflammatory activity of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MIF is required for antigen- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-driven T cell activation, and stimulates macrophages to release cytokines and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the recent suggestion that pharmacological modulation of MIF production and neutralization of its activity may have important implications for treatment of a variety of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, we determined the level of MIF in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with conventional-form multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (C-MS) and optic-spinal form multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (OpS-MS), and neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (NBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As control, the CSF of patients with non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (NIND) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of MIF in CSF samples was significantly elevated in relapsed cases of C-MS (4.13+/-1.07 ng/ml) (mean+/-S.D.) compared with control samples (2.38+/-0.60 ng/ml) (P&lt;0.0001), whereas MIF in the CSF of C-MS patients in remission was not elevated (2.65+/-0.67 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentration of MIF in the CSF of OpS-MS patients in relapse (5.53+/-1.74 ng/ml) was higher than that of patients with C-MS in relapse (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In NBD patients, the concentration of MIF in CSF was significantly elevated (7.47+/-5.61 ng/ml) compared with control samples (P&lt;0.01) and correlated well with cell count in these samples (r=0.910, P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MIF may play a pivotal role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath> of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, and that MIF may be useful in the study of differences between C-MS and OpS-MS </plain></SENT>
