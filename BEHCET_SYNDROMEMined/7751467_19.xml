<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although four of five of the new international criteria for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease relate to mucocutaneous lesions, disagreement exists as to the exact nature of cutaneous lesions (e.g., vessel-based vs follicular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to review clinical data, clinical photographs, and skin biopsy specimens from multiple medical centers throughout the world to monitor current practice in the implementation of mucocutaneous diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten medical centers responded to a request to collaborate by sending clinical data, photographs of cutaneous lesions, and biopsy specimens from 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of specimens from 22 patients, 14 revealed a histopathologic pattern of neutrophils containing perivascular and interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, whereas specimens from three patients revealed only mononuclear cells in a vessel-based pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from three patients revealed primarily folliculocentric <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and an additional two specimens were from <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Perivascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was the predominant histopathologic finding in specimens of cutaneous lesions in this clinical series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Folliculocentric lesions could not be predicted on the basis of review of clinical photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic assessment of cutaneous lesions is crucial if the proposal is accepted that exclusion of folliculocentric lesions is important to ensure accurate implementation of diagnostic criteria in patients with suspected <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
