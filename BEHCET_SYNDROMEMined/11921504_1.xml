<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell injury plays an important role in the pathogenesis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> of systemic vasculitises, but an immunopathogenic basis is also probable in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>E-selectin is an indicator of endothelial injury, and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) is increased in immunological disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum concentrations of these two markers were determined in 40 patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 40 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E-selectin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and beta 2M was determined by the nephelometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of E-selectin was 122.13 +/- 62.32 ng/ml and that of beta 2M was 0.31 +/- 0.05 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both concentrations were statistically significantly increased in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More comprehensive studies are needed to determine whether these parameters are useful indicators of the activity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
