<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral venous blood was drawn from patients with BD (n = 24; 10 patients with active and 14 patients with inactive BD) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated immediately and were cultured with concanavalin A (Con A) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and ionomycin (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>+Ion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular cytokine production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) in CD4(+) T cells was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CD4(+) T cells labelled with CFSE [5 (and 6) carboxyfluorescein diacretate, succinimidyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>] were stimulated and the cells were analysed for entry into the cytokine production effector pathway during cell division in active BD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In active BD, enhanced entry into the Th1 response effector pathway of CD4(+) T cells was observed after stimulation with Con A followed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>+Ion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of CD4(+) T cells at an identical cell division number in response to Con A followed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>+Ion revealed that IFN-gamma-producing cells were increased in active BD patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the Th1 response of dividing CD4(+) T cells is predominantly operating in active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dividing CD4(+) T cells stimulated with Con A followed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>+Ion showed a phenotype of activated effector memory T cells (CD45RA(low), CD45RO(+), CD69(high)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cell kinetics play a crucial role in Th1 cell differentiation and pathophysiology in BD </plain></SENT>
