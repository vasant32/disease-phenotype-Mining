<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate disease variables associated with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and its interaction with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty BD patients (102 patients in active stage) were enrolled in a study assessing the relationship between serum <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> concentrations and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As control diseases we studied 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>Rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and 30 multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> were assayed with a radioimmunoassay kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, immune cell expression and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, 20 active BD patients and 18 healthy controls were investigated: T-cell subsets and Treg cells were quantified by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Th1/Th2 ratio and Th17 were studied by intracytoplasmic cytokines expression (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> were observed in active BD patients compared to patients in the inactive stage and to healthy controls (p=0.0246; p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A low significant difference was observed between inactive BD and healthy controls (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Active BD expressed higher <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels than RA (p=0.007) and MS (p=0.044) patients (p=0.0238) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In active BD, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were correlated with CRP and ESR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> correlated positively with the number of Treg cells (r=0.640; p=0.0024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio (Th1/Th2) was inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D levels (r=-0.599; p=0.0053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Active BD was associated with lower serum <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that low levels of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> were associated with a decrease in Treg cells and a skewing of the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> is an important promoter of T cell regulation in vivo in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As suggested in other inflammatory/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may modulate <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
