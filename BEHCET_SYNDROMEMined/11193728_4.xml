<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular involvement with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is one of the basic characteristics of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> tendency in BD has not been understood well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the role of primary coagulation parameters in patients with BD who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relation between the clinical activity of the disease and these parameters was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 96 patients with a diagnosis of BD were studied at Ankara University, Medical School, Department of General Surgery and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD patients were separated into two groups with respect to vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A contained 22 patients with vascular attacks, and group B contained 74 patients without vascular attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 25 healthy persons comprised the control group (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The coagulation parameters assessed included protein C, protein S, antithrombin III activity, fibrinogen level, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences among the three groups with respect to protein C, protein S, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT values (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The antithrombin III value was found to be high in BD patients compared to those in the control group (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference regarding the antithrombin III value between BD patients with or without vascular attacks (p = 0.954) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the activity of disease and coagulation parameters (p &gt; 0.05), but a positive correlation was seen between the duration of illness and vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients who had had BD more than 8 years had vascular involvement (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We could not determine a specific pathology in relation to coagulation parameters that could explain the etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The elevated antithrombin III levels in patients with BD (compared to controls) may be due to a compensatory defense mechanism against increased procoagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the duration of illness and vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
