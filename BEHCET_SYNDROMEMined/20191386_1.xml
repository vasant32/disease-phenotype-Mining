<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL10 -1082G/A, -819C/T and -592C/A and TNF -308G/A polymorphisms were analyzed in 102 Turkish patients with BS and 102 healthy subjects by using amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have found no significant associations between IL10 -1082G/A, -819C/T, -592C/A, TNF-α -308G/A polymorphisms and BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, no significant correlation was found between IL10 GCC, ACC, ATA haplotypes, GCC(+)/GCC(+), GCC(+)/GCC(-), GCC(-)/GCC(-) genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between combined TNF-α/IL10 genotypes and BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that functional TNF-α, IL10 genotypes or combined TNF-α, IL10 genotypes do not play a role in BS susceptibility in Turkish BS patients </plain></SENT>
