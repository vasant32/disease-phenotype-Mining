<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although its pathogenesis is not fully understood, recent studies have suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> and neutrophil hyperfunction may be involved in its etiology and pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immune system in BD can be characterized as a divergent cytokine production profile of the mixed Th1/Th2 cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and interferon-g in the sera of patients with BD, in comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> and healthy controls, to determine the Th1/Th2 profile of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 were found to be high in active BD patients, and IL-12 and interferon-gamma levels were lower in active BD patients than in inactive BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo>, and control patients </plain></SENT>
