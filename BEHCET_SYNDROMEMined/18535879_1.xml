<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the existence of myocardial perfusion defects caused by coronary microvascular dysfunction in BD and to evaluate coronary arterial distribution and left ventricular systolic function by gated single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 23 (15 men and 8 women) patients with BD and 20 healthy controls (12 men and 8 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi>-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-99m MIBI) gated SPECT studies were performed at stress and rest in a 2-day protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stress and rest left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using non-gated SPECT images myocardial perfusion scores [summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS), summed difference score (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>), and fix defect score (FDS)] and perfusion defect extent as percentage (stress, rest ischemic, and fix %LV) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using gated SPECT images, wall motion score indices (stress wall motion score indices and rest wall motion score indices) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography (CAG) was applied to patients with abnormal myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ages of the BD and control groups were 39.3 +/- 10.6 years and 36.2 +/- 8.3 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding clinical features and cardiologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal MPS was found in 13 (56.5%) of the BD patients; 3 patients had non-transmural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 10 patients reversible perfusion defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reversible perfusion defects were also found in two controls (10.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the two groups were compared regarding the gated SPECT findings, differences were determined in the following parameters; SSS, SRS, <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, FDS, stress and rest LVEF, stress and rest %LV, and stress and rest WMSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the BD group, when gated SPECT results were compared between those with and without abnormal MPS, differences were determined in SSS, SRS, <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, FDS, stress and rest %LV, and stress and rest WMSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Epicardial coronary arteries were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in CAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial perfusion and function are disturbed owing to influenced coronary microvascularity in BD, and CAG is frequently observed to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Gated SPECT is a non-invasive reliable method that simultaneously evaluates the existence, extent and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> or infarction and the wall movements in cardio-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet </plain></SENT>
