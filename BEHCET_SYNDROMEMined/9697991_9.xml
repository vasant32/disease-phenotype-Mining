<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied anti-m-hsp65 IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 25 BD patients with cerebral parenchymal involvement (p-NBD), seven BD patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (ih-NBD), eight BD patients without central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement, 30 patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) and 24 patients with non-inflammatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorders (NIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher CSF IgG responses were detected in p-NBD patients (ELISA ratio 1.3 +/- 0.9) compared with NIC (0.7 +/- 0.4, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In p-NBD patients' IgG, IgM or IgA CSF anti-m-hsp65 positivity rate was 48% (12/25); this was significantly higher when compared with MS (3/30; P &lt; 0.03) and NIC (3/24; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF anti-m-hsp65 IgG ratios correlated with the duration of BD (r = 0.4, P &lt; 0.04) but not with the duration of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum IgM and IgA responses were elevated in ih-NBD, suggesting a different type of involvement than p-NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results implicate an increased local humoral response to m-hsp65 in the CSF of p-NBD patients, which might be related to the pathogenesis of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
