<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients who had received HSCT for vasculitic diseases and have been reported to the European League Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatism</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> or European Bone Marrow Transplantation ProMISe databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information about the disease and outcome was obtained by a questionnaire sent to the referring centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response of the disease to HSCT was defined as partial or complete responses according to the ability to reduce immunosuppression after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Medline database was searched for reports on HSCT in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Detailed information was obtained for 15 patients, whose median age at HSCT was 37 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cryoglobulinaemia</z:e> in four patients, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease in three patients, Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> in three patients, and undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, Churg-Strauss <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747733" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polychondritis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>14 patients received autologous HSCT and 1 an allogeneic HSCT as the first transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three patients, further transplantation was given because of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive transplantations (HSCT/patient, n = 1-3, median 1.3) to HSCT, was 93%, with 46% complete responses and 46% partial responses; median (range) duration of response at the time of reporting was 45 (16-84) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients died, one from advanced disease, one from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and one from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Medline search showed five other patients who were effectively treated with HSCT for vasculitic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This retrospective study suggests that autologous HSCT is feasible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its value remains to be tested in prospective controlled studies </plain></SENT>
