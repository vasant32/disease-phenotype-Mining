<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of infliximab, an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-factor (TNF)-α antibody, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> in ten patients with refractory entero-BD refractory to conventional therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The short- (weeks) and long-term (by 2 years) effects of infliximab at 3-5 mg/kg body weight every 8 weeks on the clinical course and intestinal manifestations were assessed by abdominal computed tomography (CT) and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the rate of disappearance of ileocecal ulceration at 12 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and disease-associated complications within 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the rate of disappearance of ileocecal ulcerations was 50% (5/10 patients) at 6 months and 90% (9/10 patients) at 12 months, and, therefore 90% of patients were satisfied with the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose was significantly reduced from 22.0 to 1.8 mg/day at 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse effects were observed during the 24 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence for the rapid and excellent efficacy of infliximab in patients with refractory entero-BD and that the combination of infliximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> brings about long-term alleviation of entero-BD and excellent tolerability </plain></SENT>
