<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recurrent and painful <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> of the oral mucosa and genital skin/mucosa are the most commonly observed manifestations in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They affect patients' quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the effectiveness of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in wound healing, it may also be useful for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (OU) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (GU) of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the efficacy of topically applied G-CSF in the treatment of OU and GU of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with BD diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were observed for 3 months before the study, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occurrences were recorded during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were given topical G-CSF for OU (4 x 120 microg/day, for 5 days) and/or GU (4 x 30 microg/day, for 5 days) and followed-up for 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No concurrent disease-specific or immunosuppressive topical or systemic drugs were given during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: G-CSF treatment decreased the healing time and pain of OU and GU in six of seven patients compared with the pretreatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the effectiveness of the G-CSF treatment on OU and GU healing time and pain severity did not continue during the post-treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF has beneficial effects on the healing duration and pain severity of OU and GU of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, given the high cost, impractical preparation and inability to cure the disease, G-CSF treatment should be chosen only in selected patients </plain></SENT>
