<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and sixty patients with BD (International Study Group criteria) received in the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital La Rabta in Tunisia, from 1987 to 2006, were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and genetic data were recorded and analyzed using SPSS 11.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 188 males and 72 females (M/F = 2.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease was 29 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (GU) were seen in 100% and 83% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most other common clinical features of BD were ocular involvement (51%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (38.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (33%) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (24.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 1.5% had gastrointestinal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 frequency was significantly higher in patients with BD (54% vs. 25.5% in healthy controls, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DVT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406191" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudofolliculitis</z:e> were significantly more frequent in men whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum were significantly more frequent in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DVT was also significantly more frequent in patients with GU and those with neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GU, positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test and DVT were significantly less frequent in patients with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neurological involvement consisted of 47 cases with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> parenchymal lesions and 22 with cerebral vascular lesions (13 had both lesions); HLA B51 was significantly less frequent in patients with neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our series was characterized by particular aspects such as high frequency of DVT and neuropsychiatric involvement, and rare occurrence of gastrointestinal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results confirm the ethnic and geographic variation of BD expression </plain></SENT>
