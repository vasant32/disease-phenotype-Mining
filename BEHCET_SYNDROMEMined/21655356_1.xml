<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the profile of T-helper type 17 (Th17) cell-related cytokines (interleukin-23 [IL-23], IL-27, IL-17 and interferon-γ [IFN-γ]) in postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (BD) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum was collected from seven BD patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, and from nine controls with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery, and again 1, 7, 30, and 90 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, aqueous humor was collected at commencement of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of IL-23, IL-27, IL-17, and IFN-γ in the serum and in the aqueous humor were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A laser flare-cell photometer was used to quantify intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum IL-23, IL-27, and IFN-γ levels were significantly increased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery in the BD versus the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the BD patients, serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-27 correlated strongly with aqueous flare values and cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the levels of serum IL-27 were significantly associated with serum IFN-γ levels in BD patients (r=0.796; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that serum IFN-γ and IL-27 levels are significantly elevated in BD versus control patients and are strongly associated with post-operative intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
