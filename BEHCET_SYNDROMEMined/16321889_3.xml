<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who had undergone therapeutic vitrectomy for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those patients who had shown persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> despite maximum medical therapy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical outcomes were measured by an improvement in vision of 0.3 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> relapse rates, and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with a mean postoperative follow-up of 30 months were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients visual acuity and inflammatory control were significantly improved after vitrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients with optic disc neovascularization (NVD) showed no improvement in their vision or inflammatory control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative rise of intraocular pressure was frequently associated with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that vitrectomy may be both safe and effective for the management of vitreoretinal complications in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with NVD, however, may have poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
