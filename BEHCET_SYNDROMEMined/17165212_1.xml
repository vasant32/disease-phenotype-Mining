<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few reports have been published on the clinical features of BD in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the type and frequency of these features of BD in a population of patients in the Community of Valencia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively studied clinical data from patients with BD diagnosed between 1990 and 2005 in La Fe, General and Doctor Peset Universitary Hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was carried out using the chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy four patients (40 male and 34 female) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent manifestations were oral (98.5%) and genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> (82.4%), followed by cutaneous lesions (64.2%), ocular lesions (42.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (39.4%) and vascular manifestations (28.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Venous manifestations were more frequent than arterial events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal lesions occurred more frequently in females compared with males (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vascular and ocular manifestations were more severe in males than in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, 32.4% of patients were smokers, 20.3% were hyperlipidemic, 19% hypertensive, 13.5% <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 9.5%diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were not related to thrombotic events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> in these patients (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BD in patients in the community of Valencia is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations similar to other geographical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal manifestations occur more frequently in female patients, and venous thrombotic manifestations were more frequent than arterial events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> do not seem to play a role in the development of thrombotic events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
