<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and others, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative pneumomediastinography was useful to delineate the outline of the nontumorous thymus and small "latent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The thymus was almost always successfully removed by our procedure "thymectomy via the suprasternal notch" (Method I), but the procedure combined with dissection through a parasternal incision (Method II) was frequently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Method II has been routinely adopted since 1976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thymectomy was performed on a series of 180 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis associated with nontumorous thymic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the resected thymuses, lymphoid follicle formations, which are often encountered in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, were found in 74% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up observation, ranging 2 to 17 years after surgery, revealed complete recovery and significant improvement in 100 (75%) out of 133 patients with nontumorous thymic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thymectomy was also performed in 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>, including 13 small "latent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven thymectomized patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> were also studied, and in these resected thymuses lymphoid follicle formations were fond in 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up observation revealed 84% inactive condition (counted by patient year) after thymectomy compared with 50% before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, recurrence and progression of skin, oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0744369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital lesions</z:e> were markedly suppressed after thymectomy </plain></SENT>
