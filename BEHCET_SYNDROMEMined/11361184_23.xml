<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 100 Israeli patients with BD, 66 Jews and 34 Arabs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 3 largest ethnic groups of Jewish patients originated from Iran/Iraq (n = 21), Turkey (n = 12), and North African countries (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated with respect to the entire spectrum of disease manifestations, and a systemic severity score for BD was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease expression was compared between Jewish and Arab patients and among Jewish ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between Jewish and Arab patients with respect to male:female ratio, prevalence of HLA-B5, age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, or disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease expression and severity score were also similar in the 2 groups, but Arab patients had a higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> (20.6 vs 4.6%; p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 3 largest Jewish ethnic groups, patients of North African origin had a significantly higher rate of ocular disease (p &lt; 0.01), mainly in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients also had higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, and neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet without reaching statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disease severity score in this group was significantly higher compared to the other Jewish ethnic groups (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of BD is similar in Israeli Jewish and Arab patients but the latter have more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The disease in Israeli Jewish patients is most severe in those originating from North African countries </plain></SENT>
