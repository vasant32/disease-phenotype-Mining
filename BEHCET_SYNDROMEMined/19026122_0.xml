<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We surveyed UC and CD patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> phenomenon and features of BS with the aim of determining how much overlap is present between these 2 entities in a setting where BS is relatively common, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) patients and evaluating how International Study Group (ISG) criteria perform in differentiating IBD from BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted among patients with CD and UC attending the gastroenterology outpatient clinic of a university hospital which is also a referral center for BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive CD and UC patients were screened for BS using ISG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> test was performed and evaluated by 2 independent observers in a masked manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-three patients with CD and 130 with UC were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the CD patients fulfilled ISG criteria for BS while 2 of 130 UC patients did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty CD patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> while 4 reported having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> but no scars could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two CD patients had papulopustular lesions, 2 had nodular lesions, 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two UC patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, 23 had papulopustular lesions, 3 had nodular lesions, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> test was positive according to at least one of the observers in 10/93 CD and 8/130 UC patients and according to both observers in 4/130 UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite similarities between the clinical features of CD and UC with BS, coexistence is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ISG criteria perform well in differentiating these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>About 8% of IBD patients show the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> phenomenon </plain></SENT>
