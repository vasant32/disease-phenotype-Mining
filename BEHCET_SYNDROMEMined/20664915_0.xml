<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mucocutaneous (MC) features are considered as the diagnostic hallmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To retrospectively determine the epidemiological and clinical aspects of BD mucocutaneous symptoms in Tunisia compared to those found in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were involved in a single-center dermatological recruitment for a 27-year period (1980-2007) on the basis of international BD criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our series included 19 males and 9 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 28 years and the mean age at diagnosis was 37.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of MC manifestations was as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (100%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (92.8%), other cutaneous signs (82.1%) such as papulopustular lesions (53.5%), and dermohypodermal nodes (11.53%), aphthous cutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (17.8%), and other lesions (leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>: three cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> multiform: one case, and infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pyodermatitis</z:e>: one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic manifestations were present in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MC manifestations are hallmarks of the disease and usually the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the various MC signs seen in our study broadly match those found in the literature </plain></SENT>
