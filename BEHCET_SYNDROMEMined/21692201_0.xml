<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose: To investigate the role of interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4+ T cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Blood samples were drawn from eight BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, eight BD patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBMCs were prepared from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral CD4+ T cells were purified by Human CD4 Microbeads (MACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purity rate of CD4+ T cells was detected using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Purified CD4+ T cells were stimulated with or without anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence or absence of recombinant-IL-23 (rIL-23) or recombinant-IL-12 (rIL-12) for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of IL-17, IFN-γ and IL-4 in the collected supernatants from CD4+ T cells were measured using a Duoset ELISA Development kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: The results showed that the levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ observed in active BD patients were significantly higher as compared with those in inactive patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference concerning IL-4 production between BD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rIL-23 significantly augmented the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells from both BD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both rIL-23 and rIL-12 could increase IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells from BD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effect of rIL-12 was more robust compared with that of rIL-23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither rIL-23 nor rIL-12 exerted any effect on IL-4 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: rIL-23 can promote the production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The upregulated IL-17 levels may be related with the intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
