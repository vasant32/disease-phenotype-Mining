<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Since <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, it may deteriorate the quality of life of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relationship between the disease severity and the quality of life in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:We studied 195 BD patients and 195 healthy controls who were matched with regard to age, gender and socio-economic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Krause score was calculated to assess disease severity, while Short-form-36 (SF-36) and The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-100) were used to evaluate the quality of life in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall SF-36 and WHOQOL-100 scale scores, as well as their domains were significantly lower in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BD patients, "general health", "role-physical", domains of SF-36, and "psychological", "level of independence", "environment", "environmental-public" domains of WHOQOL-100 showed significantly negative linear correlations with Krause scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, the scores of "general health", "physical functioning", "role emotional" domains of SF-36, and the scores of "psychological", "level of independence" and "social relations" domains of WHOQOL-100 were significantly worse than without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scores of "pain" domain of SF-36 and "level of independence" domain of WHOQOL-100 were significantly worse in BD patients with vascular involvement, while the scores of "mental health" domain of SF-36 and "psychological" domain of WHOQOL-100 were significantly worse in BD patients with eye involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the evaluation of SF-36 and WHOQOL-100 scores, quality of life is impaired and related with disease severity in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo>, eye involvement and vascular involvement seem to contribute to this impairment </plain></SENT>
