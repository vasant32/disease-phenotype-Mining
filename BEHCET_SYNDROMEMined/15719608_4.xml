<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated serum concentration of the novel proinflammatory Th1 cytokine; IL-18, and its inducer IL-12 in patients with immune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group I comprised32 patients of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> erythmatosus (SLE), Group II comprised 36 patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group III comprised 9 patients (2 patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>, 2 patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dermatomyositis</z:e>, 2 patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086981" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sicca syndrome</z:e>, one patient of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>Scleroderma</z:hpo>, and 2 patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">Mixed connective tissue disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group IV is a control group consists of 21 sex and age matched healthy subjects and correlated their levels with autoantibody concentration (ANA and ds-DNA), clinical grades and SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-18, IL-12, ANA and ds-DNA were measured by enzyme immuno sorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-18, IL-12 and ANA were significantly higher in the three studied groups than in the control group (IL-18; P &lt; 0.001 in the three groups, IL-12; P = 0.019, P = 0.002, and P = 0.006, and ANA; P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.002,and P = 0.006, respectively).ds-DNA was significantly higher in SLE patients than in control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant positive correlations between; A) levels of IL-18,and both ANA and ds-DNA in SLE patient (r = 0.41,P = 0.001, r = 0.58 and P=0.001 respectively); and B) IL-18 and ANA in both RA and group III patients (r = 0.32, P = 0.005, r = 0.61and P = 0.022 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, there were significant positive correlation between the levels of IL-18 and clinical grades of the three groups (r = 0.60,P = 0.001, r = 0.79,P = 0.001, r = 0.78 and P= 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In SLE patients , IL-18 concentration shows significant positive correlation with SLEDAI score (r = 0.76, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-18 and IL-12 ) may trigger the inflammatory process in immune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> and IL-18 is correlated with disease activity </plain></SENT>
