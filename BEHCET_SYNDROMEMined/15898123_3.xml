<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum prolactin levels were measured by a chemiluminescence method in 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and compared with 20 age-and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were subdivided into two groups according to disease activity: active (18 patients; 13 men and five women, average age 34.0 +/- 6.5 (28-48) years), and inactive (14 patients; 10 men and four women, average age 32.7 +/- 3.1 (22-49 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> had higher serum prolactin levels than the inactive and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prolactin levels in patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> differed significantly from the healthy control subjects (p &lt; 0.05) only, but not the inactive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients out of 32 (12.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients showed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000870'>hyperprolactinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four of these cases were from the active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolactin levels were correlated with ESR (p &lt; 0.05) and CRP (p &lt; 0.05) levels in the active BD group, but not in the inactive BD and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a possible role for this immunoregulatory hormone in the disease expression and pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
