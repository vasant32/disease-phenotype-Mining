<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Experimental evidence suggests that inappropriate regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF alpha) may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is supported by recent reports highlighting the efficacy of anti-TNF alpha agents in the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TNF gene is encoded in the class III region of the HLA complex adjacent to HLA-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This genetic proximity to a gene that is already widely implicated in disease susceptibility led us to investigate the association between TNF promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 133 UK white Caucasoid patients with BD and 354 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We attempted to dissect the contribution of individual polymorphisms in this gene-dense region by linkage disequilibrium mapping across 6 adjacent genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report a novel association with the TNF promoter allele TNF-1031C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis identified 2 extended HLA haplotypes associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of them contained the previously recognized susceptibility gene HLA-B*51, while the other was defined by HLA-B*5701 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both of these haplotypes contained the TNF promoter polymorphism -1031C, an allele that was associated with disease even in individuals who did not carry either HLA-B*51 or HLA-B*5701 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The TNF-1031C allele is independently associated with susceptibility to BD in Caucasoid patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be required to determine the functional effects of this polymorphism, its influence in disease pathogenesis, and its role in other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
