<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether initial echocardiographic findings are useful to predict recurrent AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lesion severity on preoperative echocardiography was scored for redundant aortic valve cusp (0-2 points), aortic pseudoaneurysm (0-2 points), and dissection of the adjacent interventricular septum (0-2 points) in 22 patients with severe AR due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (13 men; mean age, 42.4 ± 11.5 years), which was confirmed by histologic examination after open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrent AR developed in 13 patients at a median of 12.6 months (range, 2.4-70.3 months) after the first operation, and 10, four, and one patient underwent second, third, and fourth surgery, respectively, to control recurrent AR; three patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those patients with recurrent AR had a significantly higher incidence of repeat surgery or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (84.6% [11 of 13] vs 0%, P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that perioperative immunotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.002; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.1761; P = .006) and total echocardiographic score (hazard ratio, 2.843; 95% confidence interval, 1.350-5.991; P = .006) were independent factors associated with recurrent AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year AR-free survival rates were 73 ± 10%, 46 ± 12%, and 39 ± 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal cutoff value for total echocardiographic score was 3.0, and the 5-year AR-free survival rates were significantly lower in patients with scores ≥ 3 (20 ± 13% vs 50 ± 19%, P = .022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study confirms that initial echocardiographic features can provide useful prognostic information in patients with AR due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
