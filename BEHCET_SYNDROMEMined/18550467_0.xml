<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in nodular lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et syndrome (BS) and compare them with results for the 2 most common types of <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN) and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (NV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included the data for 28 patients with nodular lesions of BS, 24 with EN, and 22 with NV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A panel of monoclonal antibodies against E-selectin, P-selectin, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, platelet endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1 were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution and intensity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the BS and control groups in regard to these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules except for ICAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of strongly ICAM-1-stained endothelial cells in subcutaneous fat tissue in relation to the total number of endothelial cells was the lowest in BS (P= .0208) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because many lesions of BS were related to an enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, the lower percentage of ICAM-1 expression seems counterintuitive </plain></SENT>
