<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> are among the clinical features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), the pathogenesis of which is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e>, being a well known risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, is also a contributive risk factor for the arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four patients fulfilling the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease (54 males, 30 females, mean age 36+/-9 yr) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were carefully screened for a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and were separated into two groups with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six healthy individuals (23 males, 13 females), matched for age and sex with the BD group, were included as a negative control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if they had any condition that might affect plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e>, we also included 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients (five males, 24 females) receiving MTX weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data were analysed with the chi(2) test and Student's t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were found in the MTX group (17.5+/-5.3 micromol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations in BD patients were significantly higher than in the healthy controls (11.5+/-5.3 vs. 8.8+/-3.1 micromol/l, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among BD patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 20 of 31 (64%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e>, and this was significantly higher than in those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was no significant difference between patients with non-thrombotic BD and healthy controls (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we found no correlation between the duration of the post-thrombotic period and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the variables investigated, only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> was found to be related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> may be assumed to be an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Unlike the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> is a correctable risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This finding might lead to new avenues in the prophylaxis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
