<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fas (CD95) is a cell surface molecule that mediates receptor-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in various cells including autoreactive T cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections of 29 <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and of 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non-specific inflammatory process cases from the archives of the Ondokuz Mayis University's Pathology Department were immunohistochemically stained for bcl-2 and Fas (CD95), and lymphocytes in the dermal infiltrate were evaluated for cytoplasmic staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 staining was observed in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of 22 cases (75.8%) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 staining was detected in two (20%) control skin biopsy samples with non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
