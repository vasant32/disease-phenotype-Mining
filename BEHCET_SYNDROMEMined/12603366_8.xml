<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven BD patients and 27 control subjects underwent a validated semistructured questionnaire based on the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Society criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, disease activity, and current medication were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> occurred in 88.9% of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the prevalence of the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> syndromes between BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> (MwA) was significantly more frequent in BD patients than controls (44.4% vs. 11.1%, respectively, P= 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between MwA and clinical, and behavioural variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> syndromes, MwA showed the highest frequency in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A vascular or neuronal subclinical dysfunction could justify this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A careful interview for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> might be included in the diagnostic work-up of BD </plain></SENT>
