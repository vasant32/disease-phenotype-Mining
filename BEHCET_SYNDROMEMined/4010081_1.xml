<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With an electron microscope, we examined the peripheral blood neutrophils of 6 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease at the exacerbation stage and those of 3 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We counted the number of microtubules on enlarged electron micrographs of the neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each electron micrograph was photographed at a direct magnification of 15,000, so that at least one centriole was contained in the photograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was enlarged twice the size of the negative and printed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average number of microtubules in the neutrophils of the 6 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was 4.96 +/- 2.76 (SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was 2.36 +/- 1.88 in the neutrophils of the 3 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically highly significant (P less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that microtubules may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
