<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One of the prominent features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is responsible for endothelial vasorelaxation and inhibition of platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess serum total NO, erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), whole blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px), plasma total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status (TAS) and plasma malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in patients with BD and to correlate their levels with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 49 patients with BD and 26 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the subjects was given a standardized diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD were randomized to two groups according to their disease activity (active/inactive, 26/23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We measured serum total NO levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and SOD, GSH-Px, TAS and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels by spectrophotometric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with active disease (n = 26), serum total NO levels were found to be significantly decreased when compared with the inactive (n = 23) and control (n = 26) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels were also significantly lower in patients with inactive disease and in total BD patients (n = 49) than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GSH-Px activities and TAS levels were significantly lower in total BD patients than those in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with active disease and total BD patients exhibited markedly higher <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels than the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels in the patients with active disease were also found to be elevated compared with the patients with inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that changes in parameters associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> such as NO-related processes, activities of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes in the bloodstream and erythrocytes and total plasma <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity are involved in the aetiopathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> seen in BD </plain></SENT>
