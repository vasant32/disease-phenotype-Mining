<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Eye involvement is the main cause of morbidity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the combined use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and interferon alfa in treating this condition has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten male BD patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> involvement but no irreversible structural changes were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> 2.5 mg/kg/day and IFN alpha 2b three times weekly for 24 weeks in an open trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At week 24, IFN alpha was stopped and the patients continued to use <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or received other immunosuppressives as indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was assessed by visual acuity changes of either eye under the combination treatment and during the follow-up after stopping interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared to the study entry, the mean visual acuities of either eye increased significantly at the end of the combination treatment (right eye 5.8 +/- 1.26 vs. 8.3 1.14; P = 0.043; left eye 6.3 1.15 SEM vs. 9.1 +/- 0.9 SEM; P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improvement in visual acuity persisted in the nine patients who were followed for 7.2 +/- 1.6 SEM months after stopping interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reversible hematologic toxicity, mostly in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, was detected in six patients during the combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IFN alpha and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> appears to be effective for eye involvement of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the frequent occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> mandates close monitoring </plain></SENT>
