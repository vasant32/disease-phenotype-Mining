<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> extended not only into the ventricular septum but also to the right atrium and ventricle, with a complicated cavity formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We speculate that complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> occurred due to an enlargement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> into the ventricular septum, leading to a direct conduction system injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative echocardiography and aortography were insufficient to recognize the extent of the lesion; subsequent operative examination revealed the true size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At operation, it is important to understand the lesion dimensions fully in order that appropriate surgical procedures be performed </plain></SENT>
