<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been recognized as an important effector cell in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granulysin is a cytolytic granule protein expressed by CTLs and natural killer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the involvement of granulysin-producing T cells in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, lymphocyte subsets expressing granulysin were investigated in mucocutaneous lesions of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum granulysin levels were assayed by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Granulysin-positive cells were seen in specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo>-like eruptions, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed granulysin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum granulysin levels did not correlate with disease activity in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immune reactions mediated by granulysin-positive CTLs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo>-like eruptions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
