<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and to identify any associations between audiologic findings and other clinical manifestations and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study group was made up of 41 adults with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and 41 healthy sex- and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and controls underwent a complete clinical otolaryngologic examination, which included pure-tone audiometry, acoustic impedance testing, and otoacoustic emissions testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Audiology revealed that the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> (SNHL) was significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients than in the controls-68.3 vs. 22.0% (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease had no significant impact on whether patients did or did not experience hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss was the fourth most common clinical finding in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that SNHL is present in a significant number of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients, and we suggest the need for an adequate investigation of hearing in the routine follow-up of these patients </plain></SENT>
