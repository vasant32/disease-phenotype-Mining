<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods: Twenty-eight patients with the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfilled the international criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 17 males and 6 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients are divided into subgroups according to the clinical and paraclinical characteristics such as disease duration, ocular, articular and neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum prolactin was measured by ELISA using Merck Kits on a Maggia 7000 Analyser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in males was&lt;17ng/ml in males and&lt;18ng/ml in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean PRL level in each group and subgroup was calculated and compared with Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean prolactin level in the BD group (mean=13.76, SD=6.82), was higher than in the control group (mean=10.13, SD=5.46) with no statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean prolactin levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups of patients with BD were higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but no statistically significant difference was shown between these subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000870'>Hyperprolactinemia</z:hpo> occurred in a small number of patients with BD and its significance remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum PRL level did not correlate with disease manifestations and activity </plain></SENT>
