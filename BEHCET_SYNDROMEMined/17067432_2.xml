<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed whether this polymorphism is associated with BD, in another group of Turkish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 132 consecutive Turkish BD patients being followed up by Ege University Rheumatology Department and 91 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were genotyped by PCR-RFLP for 894 G--&gt;T in exon 7 (Glu298Asp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the T allele in BD group (101/264) was significantly higher than in healthy controls (OR 1.88, %95 CI 1.27-2.49, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the homozygote (TT) Glu298Asp polymorphism in BD (27/132) was also significantly higher than in healthy controls (5/91) (OR 3.72, %95 CI 3.44-4.0, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no association was found between the Glu298Asp polymorphism and clinical parameters in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that Glu298Asp polymorphism of the eNOS gene was associated with BD in Turkish patients </plain></SENT>
