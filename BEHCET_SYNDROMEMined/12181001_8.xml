<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To outline the clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in our large series of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) patients with neurologic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> files of 223 patients with neuro-BD were evaluated retrospectively, and the group with clearly documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was included in the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, EEG, neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings were reevaluated, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were classified according to the new proposed criteria of the International League Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On excluding the patients in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were due to possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-provoking factors, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> that appeared during a neurologic exacerbation were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were seen in 10 (4.48%) of 223 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were one female and nine male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred during neurologic exacerbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the actual prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> due to BD in our group is 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining five patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were not related to neurologic BD attacks, but probably were due to some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-provoking factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predominating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> type was generalized tonic-clonic <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011153'>focal motor seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is notable that four patients died 1-5 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are rare in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> due to some interventions and drugs are as frequent as neuro-BD-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-provoking factors must be considered before attributing them to the pathogenetic mechanism of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> seems to be associated with a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
