<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the pathogenesis of BD, we performed histological and immunohistochemical studies of these mucocutaneous lesions, an assay of neutrophil activity, and HLA typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dense dermal or subcutaneous infiltrations of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) without leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were found in 28 of 57 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, deposits of C3 on the vessels were found in 12 of 31 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deposits of immunoglobulin were not found except for one of IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C3 deposits and PMN infiltrations were significantly related (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PMN activity by polarization was enhanced; however, the results did not show a significant relationship with the PMN infiltrations or the C3 deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of HLA-B51 was significantly high in BD, but no significant relationship was found between HLA-B51 and the results of other examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the pathogenesis of BD lesions differs from that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen diseases</z:e> and that C3 deposits on the vessels may play an important role in the development of mucocutaneous lesions where PMN have mainly infiltrated </plain></SENT>
