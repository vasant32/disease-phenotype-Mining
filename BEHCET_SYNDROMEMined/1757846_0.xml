<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only few reports have been published in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the neuro-otological findings in 33 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease completely or incompletely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into 2 groups: one is group of NB and the other is a group of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease without NB (non-NB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the latter was divided into 2 subgroups of patients with dysequilibrium and patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They underwent equilibrium function tests, such as body balance test, gaze test, spontaneous and positional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> test, eye tracking test (ETT) and optokinetic pattern test (OKP) by using electro-nystagmography (ENG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar and brain stem lesions were confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of NB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most cases (6 of 8 cases) in the subgroup of dysequilibrium of the non-NB group showed peripheral vestibular disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other two patients were diagnosed to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebro-basilar insufficiency</z:e> (VBI) and vascular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorder, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine of 13 patients in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> equilibrium subgroup of the non-NB group were diagnosed to be neuro-otologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, we found two patients with peripheral vestibular disturbance and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disorder associated with hearing disturbance of the retrocochlear origin, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The neuro-otological examination is assumed to be useful to diagnose neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, to reveal the lesion site and the state of dysequilibrium in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
