<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sera from thirty patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, thirty patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and thirty healthy control subjects were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed raised levels of immune complexes in 60% of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and 40% of patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the levels of immune complexes between the neuro-ocular and arthritic types of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome as compared with the muco-cutaneous type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulceration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A close association was found between the disease activity and the amount of immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that immune complexes may play a part in the transition from the epithelial involvement of mucosa or cutaneous tissues to the neuro-ocular and arthritic types of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another factor in tissue distribution might be the size of immune complexes, as multi-focal involvement of tissues in the neuro-ocular type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is associated with a broad range of immune complexes from 3 X 10(5) to 3 X 10(6) daltons </plain></SENT>
