<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding for CTLA4 has been suggested as a candidate for conferring susceptibility to autoinflammatory diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the polymorphisms of the CTLA4 gene [promoter region (-1722 T/C, -1661 A/G and -318 C/T) and exon 1 (+49 G/A)] and the differences of serum soluble sCTLA4 levels in 285 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) and 287 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the CTLA4 -1661 GG genotype was significantly higher in BD patients than in controls [P = 0.019, odds ratio (OR) = 5.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-23.86] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the genotype frequency for CTLA4 -1722 TC was significantly higher (P = 0.014, OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.13-2.99), while CTLA4 -1722 CC was significantly lower (P = 0.018, OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.20-0.87) in BD patients with ocular lesions compared with patients without this symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum sCTLA4 levels in BD patients were significantly lower, especially in BD patients with the CTLA4 +49 G allele, than those in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although our understanding of the role of the CTLA4 gene and its protein product in BD is incomplete, these results suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms of the promoter and exon regions in the CTLA4 gene are candidates that predispose to BD and that sCTLA4 may be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> and disease expressions associated with BD </plain></SENT>
