<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with BD activated by lyophilized whole bacterium of S. sanguis were assayed by two-color flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for gamma delta+ T cell receptor, CD4 or CD8 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lymphostimulatory activity of S. sanguis to either gamma delta+ CD4-CD8-, gamma delta+ CD4-CD8+, gamma delta-CD4+CD8-, or gamma delta-CD4-CD8+ T cells was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absolute number of gamma delta+ T cells from patients with BD (n = 8) as well as from healthy controls (n = 7) significantly increased after stimulation with S. sanguis, whereas gamma delta- T cells from both groups showed no response to S. sanguis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absolute number of gamma delta+ CD8+ T cells from patients with BD significantly increased after stimulation with S. sanguis compared with healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral gamma delta+ CD8+ T cells from patients with BD showed a significantly higher proliferative response to S. sanguis compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
