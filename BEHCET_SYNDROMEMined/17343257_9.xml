<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) is unknown, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e> appears to be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve understanding of the role of T cells and cytokines in BD, the current study analysed the localization and extent of expression of T cell subsets, cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> from BD patients and for comparison in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>), as well as in healthy oral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> of 25 BD patients and 19 <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients and oral mucosa from six healthy volunteers were immunoperoxidase stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both CD4- and CD8-positive T cells were present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> of BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T helper (Th)1 cytokines interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)alpha and the Th1-associated chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 were increased in both patient groups as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, indicating the involvement of a Th1 immune response in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> of both BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the Th2 cytokine IL-4 was only observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> of BD patients but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study that shows the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as Th1-associated chemokine receptors, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> of BD patients, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients, at a protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 within the oral lesions of only BD patients is suggestive of a more complex antigenic stimuli in BD patients compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
