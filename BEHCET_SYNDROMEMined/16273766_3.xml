<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is strong evidence that Th1-type cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that mediates Th1-polarized immune responses, and elevated levels of IL-18 have been observed in the sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential associations of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions -137 (G/C) and -607 (C/A) in the promoter region of the IL-18 gene with a susceptibility to BD in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with BD and 105 healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the subjects were genotyped using sequence specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotypes and alleles between patients with BD and controls were compared using the chi2 test, together with Yate's correction where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis was assessed using the EH program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype and allele distributions of the two SNPs did not differ significantly between patients with BD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The haplotype frequencies of the IL-18 promoter polymorphisms were also similar between patients with BD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of the GG genotype at position -137 was significantly higher in BD patients with ocular lesions than in those without ocular lesions (p = 0.026, pc = 0.048, OR = 4.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the IL-18 gene polymorphisms were not associated with a susceptibility to BD in the Korean population, the patients carrying the GG genotype at position -137 had a higher risk of developing the ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies in other populations are required to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
