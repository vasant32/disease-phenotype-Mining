<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of nine patients (<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> in eight patients, both eyes in one) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who underwent pars plana vitrectomy because of dense vitreous opacification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indications for vitrectomy, the effect of vitrectomy on the frequency of severe intraocular inflammatory episodes, and visual prognosis were investigated in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were male, and their ages ranged between 28-45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined lensectomy was performed on those with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative follow-up was between 12-66 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients preoperative visual acuity was hand motions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively there was no change in vision in five eyes, however visual acuity improved in five eyes, between counting fingers and 0.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed any severe postoperative intraocular inflammatory episodes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">phthisis</z:e> did not develop in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, pars plana vitrectomy was found to have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was also a decrease in the frequency of severe intraocular inflammatory episodes in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with severe vitreous opacities, who did not respond to maximum medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, further studies on larger groups should be performed in order to confirm the findings of this study </plain></SENT>
