<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The postoperative recurrence of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and simple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> was frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment for postoperative recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> is palliative, and the patient often requires surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied about an effect of absolute <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> spraying via endoscopy for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The postoperative rate of recurrence was 56% (9/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Commonly the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> recurred around the anastomotic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed spraying for recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> with absolute <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> via endoscope in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This therapy was effective for the recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in the 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, the patients who were monitored and treated by the spraying of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> did not require further surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This therapy should performed for recurrent ulceration in cases of simple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
