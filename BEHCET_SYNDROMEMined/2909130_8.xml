<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient population was young, ranging in age from 19 to 45 years; seven were men and six were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presumed cause was the use of oral contraceptives in three, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> rubra vera in two, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> in one patient and unknown in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 13 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> and disturbed liver function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on the symptoms and signs: angiographic demonstration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142158" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic vein occlusion</z:e> and a patent inferior vena cava; pressure measurements that showed an inferior vena caval pressure that was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or within the usual range for patients with massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and an elevated wedged hepatic vein pressure that was much higher than the inferior vena caval pressure, and the results of biopsy of the liver showing centrilobular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Side to side portacaval shunt was very effective in decompressing the liver, reducing the mean corrected portal pressure from 240 millimeters of saline solution before to 7 millimeters of saline solution after the shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative survival rate was 92 per cent, and the long term survival rate for three to 16 years is 85 per cent </plain></SENT>
