<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) in systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and to assess the correlation between AECA and disease activity, and try to discuss the classification of AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cyto-ELISA with EA.hy926 and HMEC-1, two immortalized cell lines, as substrates, was applied to detect AECA in 122 cases of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, including 43 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, 19 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, 19 cases of Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo>, 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microscopic polyangiitis</z:e>, 9 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e>, 3 cases of Churg-Strause syndrome, 2 cases of giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and other 16 cases of which could not be classified clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with SLE, RA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unknown origin, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons were used as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the associations of AECA to laboratory findings and clinical disease activity (scored by BVAS) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the AECA value from the two different substrate cells were analyzed for correlation and difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With either EA.hy926 or HMEC-1 as substrates, the AECA prevalence rates of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (respectively 33.61% and 37.70%) were significantly higher than those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and RA groups (less than 10%), and the prevalence of AECA in SLE (61.75%) was higher than that of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (37.70%) when using HMEC-1 as substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AECA was found to correlate very well with ESR in 122 cases of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and with BVAS in 40 cases of small systemic vasuculitides, including Wegener's disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microscopic polyangiitis</z:e>, Churg-Strause syndrome and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pair AECA values with EA.hy926 and HMEC-1 as substrate cells were found to be correlated significantly, and the matching rate was 92.62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prevalence of AECA in systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AECA indicates the clinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As to the assumption of classification of AECA into antibodies against microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells, further study need to be done to prove or disprove it </plain></SENT>
