<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is produced by macrophages, neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells and can alter vessel permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> with unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is one of the prominent features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated the possible involvement of proinflammatory cytokines [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8], nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and adrenomedullin in the etiopathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since VEGF expression is induced by these cytokines and VEGF itself is a potent stimulator of NO production with endothelial cell effects, this study aimed to investigate whether VEGF was affected during the course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the possible involvement of VEGF in ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome or in disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicenter case-control study included a total of 39 patients with active (n = 22) or inactive (n = 17) <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (mean age, 38.1 +/- 10.4 years; 21 men and 18 women) satisfying International Study Group criteria, and 15 healthy hospital-based control volunteers (mean age, 39.2 +/- 9.3 years; eight men and seven women) matched for age and gender from a similar ethnic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined by a dermatologist and an ophthalmologist with an interest in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma VEGF concentrations were measured using a newly established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactant parameters such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha2-macroglobulin, and neutrophil count were used to classify the disease in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients as active or inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Wilcoxon test or the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for statistical analysis as indicated and the results were expressed as mean +/- SD, with range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma VEGF level in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (291.9 +/- 97.1 pg/mL; range 121-532 pg/mL) was higher than that in control subjects (103.0 +/- 43.6 pg/mL; range 25-187 pg/mL) and the difference was significant (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with active disease had significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher VEGF levels than patients with inactive disease (347.6 +/- 87.1 vs. 219.9 +/- 51.6 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients (n = 23) had higher VEGF levels (315.7 +/- 92.1 pg/mL) than nonocular patients (n = 16, 257.8 +/- 96.6 pg/mL) and the difference was of borderline significance (P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactant parameters were significantly higher in the active stage than in the inactive stage (for each, P &lt; 0.01) or in control subjects (for each, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VEGF may participate in the course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, especially in the active stage, and elevated levels of VEGF may be an additional risk factor for the development of ocular disease, contributing to poor visual outcome </plain></SENT>
