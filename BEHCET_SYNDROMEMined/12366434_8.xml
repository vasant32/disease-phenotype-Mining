<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its appearance may be polymorphic, pruritic, recurrent or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> as is described in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histological combination of neutrophilic infiltration in and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the eccrine secretory gland epithelium is highly characteristic for NEH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It typically occurs in patients receiving chemotherapeutic drugs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, but other associations have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, we report the first case of NEH in a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous manifestations of BD, an inflammatory systemic disorder of unknown origin, include neutrophilic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000999'>pyoderma</z:hpo> gangrenosum, although these are unusual in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NEH could be another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutrophilic dermatosis</z:e> related to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that NEH is not strictly related to chemotherapeutic drugs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears to be a reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatosis</z:e> associated with other factors as well, including BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment was successful with dapsone 100 mg daily </plain></SENT>
