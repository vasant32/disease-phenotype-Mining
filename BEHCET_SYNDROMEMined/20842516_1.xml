<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The information concerning aneurysmal progress in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is still insufficient, while researches in the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aneurysmal formation are rapidly expanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study is to investigate the role of metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in vascular complications which is observed in 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three groups have been studied; patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> who have vascular problems (vasculo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s), and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third group was used as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activity and gene expression levels of MMP-9 in plasma have been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed that compared to AAA patients there was no difference in the MMP-9 activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients (vascular and non-vascular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the gene expression level and activity of MMP-9 for every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in the gene expression level for MMP-9 could only be detected at two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of them was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s, the other was AAA patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is surprising that MMP levels of these patients were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s had low protein level, another patient with AAA had high of MMP-9 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This result suggested to us that the relationship between gene expression and active protein level is not correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is not sufficient alone to determine MMPs levels for evaluating the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the same time gene expression and the level of active protein should be assessed together </plain></SENT>
