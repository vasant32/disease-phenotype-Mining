<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twenty cases within a pediatric age group whose ages differ from 5 to 15 years were studied retrospectively to determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, the initial signs, and the progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 18 of the patients whose average age were 13.3 years (5 to 18 years), the initial symptoms associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were oral aphtous lesions or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 16 developed ocular symptoms in a later stage, at an average of 15.5 years of age (11 to 18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>Posterior uveitis</z:hpo> was the most common manifestation, detected in 75% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients had neurobehçet's disease, and the neurologic manifestations were dural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, after an average 4 years' follow up (6 months to 13 years) the clinical progress of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the pediatric age group was similar to that found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adult disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the ocular signs (i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>) and the systemic features (i.e., aphtous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and neurologic signs) were manifested at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or during the progress of the disease </plain></SENT>
