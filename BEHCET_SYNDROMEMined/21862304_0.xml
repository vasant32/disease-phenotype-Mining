<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) estimated by echocardiography in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) patients with pulmonary artery involvement (PAI), in healthy controls and in diseased controls with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc), as well as in BS patients without PAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 3 groups of patients with BS (patients with PAI: n = 30, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> but without PAI: n = 26 and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>: n = 21), patients with SSc (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) was estimated by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The upper limit for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sPAP was arbitrarily set at 35 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated cardiac function by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests, a six-minute walking test (six-MWT) and several serum biomarkers were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of patients with an elevated sPAP was significantly higher only among BS patients with PAI (17%) and among patients with SSc (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, DL(CO) was decreased and pro-BNP levels were increased in BS patients with PAI, which are similar to the results in patients with SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BS patients with PAI also had mild RV diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When BS involves the pulmonary arteries, it can cause mild elevations in the estimated sPAP, decrease in DL(CO), mild cardiac dysfunction and increase in pro-BNP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that BS can also affect the small/micro vessels of the heart and the lungs in addition to the well-recognized large vessel disease </plain></SENT>
