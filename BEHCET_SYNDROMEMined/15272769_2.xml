<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the transmembrane (TM) of region of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>, there is a trinucleotide repeat (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>/AGC) microsatellite polymorphism in exon 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five alleles with 4, 5, 6 and 9 repetitions or 5 repetitions with 1 additional nucleotide insertion (GGCT) are identified and they were named A4, A5, A5.1, A6, and A9 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the allele frequencies of 127 Indonesians on Bacan Island and 250 Japanese in the Kanto area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the genotyping result, the frequency among Indonesians was as follows: A4 15.4%, A5 26.0%, A5.1 16.5%, A6 5.5%, and A9 36.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency among Japanese was as follows: A4 20.6%, A5 28.1%, A5.1 10.8%, A6 27.2%, and A9 13.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allele 9 is significantly increased and allele 6 significantly decreased in Indonesians compared with Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> microsatellite polymorphism are quite different in each race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among Indonesians, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A9 allele, which was reported to be negatively associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, was significantly higher, whereas the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6 allele frequency, which was reported to be positively associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, was significantly lower among Japanese </plain></SENT>
