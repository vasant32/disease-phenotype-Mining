<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the outcome of initial trabeculectomy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) in the management of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) in a 1-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three eyes of 13 cases with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with BD, were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent primary trabeculectomy with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operative success was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) &lt; or =20 mm Hg (+/- medical therapy) in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">phthisis</z:e> and without the necessity of further surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and success rates at the postoperative first day, first month, sixth month, and first year were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the eyes (100%) at the postoperative first day and month, in 21 eyes (91.3%) at the postoperative sixth month and in 19 eyes (82.6%) at the postoperative first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean preoperative IOP was 30.9+/-5.3 mm Hg under the mean 3.3+/-0.7 antiglaucoma medications but it reduced to 16.8+/-3.1 mm Hg under the mean 1.7+/-0.8 medications at the postoperative sixth month and 18.5+/-3.2 mm Hg under the mean 2.6+/-1.1 medications at the postoperative first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Trabeculectomy with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> provides reduction of IOP and the number of antiglaucoma medications in cases with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with BD in a 1-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
