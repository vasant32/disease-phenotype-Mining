<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of patients were in their teens and twenties (mean age: 36.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was correctly made in only 8 cases (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 32 cases (86.5%), the lesion was localized regardless of the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A solitary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was observed in 22 cases (60%), while multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were present in 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A recurrence after the initial operation was observed in 12 patients (46.1%) and reoperation was performed 19 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of recurrence developed within 2 years after each operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The type of operation, the location of lesion and the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> did not appear to be related to the recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a preoperative diagnosis is difficult and the recurrence rate is high, post- operative periodic follow-up with radiography and endoscopy are strongly recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the time of operation, the entire bowel should be examined and bowel resection should include a generous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resection margin as well as skip lesions </plain></SENT>
