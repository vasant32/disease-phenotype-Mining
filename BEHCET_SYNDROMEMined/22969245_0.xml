<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the relationship between the change of Treg, aTreg and rTreg and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treg cells and those subpopulations were analyzed by using the human regulatory T cell staining kit and CD45RA surface marker for 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), 13 systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SLE), 7 Behcet's disease (BD), and 22 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of Treg cells was significantly lower in RA (3.8% ± 1.0%) (P &lt; 0.001) and BD (3.3% ± 0.5%) (P &lt; 0.01) compared to healthy controls (5.0% ± 1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of aTreg cells was also significantly lower in RA (0.4% ± 0.2%) (P = 0.008) and BD (0.3% ± 0.1%) (P = 0.013) compared to healthy controls (0.6% ± 0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rTreg cells showed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of aTreg to rTreg was lower in RA patients (0.4% ± 0.2%) than that in healthy controls (0.7% ± 0.4%) (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the decrement of aTreg not rTreg cells contributes the decrement of total Treg cells in peripheral blood of RA and BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of Treg subpopulations would be more informative than total Treg cells in investigating mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
