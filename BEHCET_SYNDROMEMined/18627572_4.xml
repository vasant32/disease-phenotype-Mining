<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyse the influence of HLA-B*51 and other HLA class I alleles in BD susceptibility in a Portuguese population and its association with disease severity, we studied 78 BD patients and 208 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into two severity groups as described by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="37691">Gul</z:chebi> et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As expected, a higher frequency of HLA-B*51 was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HLA-Cw*16 alleles was significantly higher in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding severity, HLA-B*27 frequency was higher in the severe group compared with controls and with the mild group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, HLA-B*51 and HLA-Cw*16 seem to confer susceptibility to BD in this patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*27 may be important as a prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
