<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Resistin, a recently identified adipocytokine, has been found to play an important role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and the processes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum resistin levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) have not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the relation between resistin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with or without ocular involvement and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with BD and 19 healthy control subjects were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While 14 patients had posterior segment involvement of the eye, the other 8 did not have ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum resistin and interleukin-6 (IL-6), levels were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were tested for statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean resistin and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with BD than the control subjects (p = 0.011 and p = 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in resistin and IL-6 levels between the patients with non-ocular BD and controls (p = 0.013 and p = 0.0001, respectively), as well as resistin and IL-6 levels between the ocular BD group and the control group (p = 0.05 and p = 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference between patients with ocular versus non-ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Resistin levels were found to be raised in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with or without ocular involvement compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
