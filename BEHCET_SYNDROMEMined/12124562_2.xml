<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left common femoral artery in a 23-year-old Portuguese man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary treatment was surgical (aneurysmectomy and prosthetic revascularization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The early occlusion of the left femoral revascularized artery was treated surgically with a new bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occlusion of the right limb of the aortoiliac graft was asymptomatic and was not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two months after admission to our hospital, the stenosis of the infrarenal aorta successfully treated by angioplasty via the occluded right limb of the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was followed up for 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He could only walk a short distance and had rest pain in the left foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography showed a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the infrarenal aorta, and an occlusion of the remaining left limb of the aortoiliac graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The endovascular treatment performed does not avoid the need for surgical treatment, because occlusion and false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> may occur after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The endovascular approach can also be used during a sudden inflammatory surge, and makes it possible to wait for a quiescent period when surgery can be performed </plain></SENT>
