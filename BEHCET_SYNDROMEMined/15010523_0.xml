<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the beneficial effects of thalidomide on recurrent perforating <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> in a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 24-year-old Turkish woman with BD was admitted to our hospital because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had been receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> 1.5 mg/day and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> 150 mg/day for treatment of BD for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During emergency laparatomy, 2 perforating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were detected in the anterior cecum, which were treated with debridement and primary repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She experienced 2 more episodes of intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> during the second and fifth weeks despite intense immunosuppressive treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> were found in the posterolateral cecum and transverse colon during the second operation and in the terminal ileum during the third one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide 100 mg/day was then started, and the symptoms disappeared within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The woman experienced no other intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> during the follow-up period of 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The mode of action of thalidomide in BD is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BD, various cytokines have been shown to be abnormally expressed and neutrophils are overactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is a possible mechanism of action with thalidomide reducing both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor and the neutrophil migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide may be an effective alternative treatment for BD patients with recurrent and perforating <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> despite intense immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
