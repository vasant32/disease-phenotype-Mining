<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old man presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, bulging on the lateral wall of the left pyriform sinus, and a firm and fixated neck mass suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the neck demonstrated a solid mass, around the bifurcation of the carotid artery together with a pseudoaneurysm of the left external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mass was about four centimeters in diameter and extended to hypopharynx medially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy from neck mass and hypopharynx revealed no specific pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up the firm and fixated mass changed into a completely pulsatile one in the following three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reassessment of the patient's past history in detail revealed that he had had recurrent <z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> and recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed to be BD and treatment consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> 1 mg/day, peroral was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He had a favorable outcome after treatment and was asymptomatic at follow-up of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is unusual for BD to present as a neck mass but yet it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of neck masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present case report demonstrates how such a mass may mimic metastatic tumoral involvement and cause diagnostic dilemma </plain></SENT>
