<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a nine-year period, 50 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome were followed in a multidisciplinary combined clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed by an ophthalmologist, a rheumatologist and a specialist in oral medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on disease activity and damage were collected using a standardized proforma for each specialty </plain></SENT>
