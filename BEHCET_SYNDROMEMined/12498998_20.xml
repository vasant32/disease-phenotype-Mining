<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In BD, the increased production of reactive oxygen species from activated neutrophils may reduce concentrations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamins and enzymes in plasma and red blood cells (RBC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vitamin E is an important fat soluble <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and its role on <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> parameters of BD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was undertaken to evaluate the role of vitamin E on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> vitamin and enzyme concentrations in plasma and RBC in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were three groups i.e., control, patient and treatment groups with twenty-five subjects in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonsmoking patients with BD, patient group, was compared with an equal number of healthy control subjects (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken from both control and patient groups and then oral vitamin E was daily supplemented to the patients with BD for six weeks (treated group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of six weeks, blood was taken from the treated group once more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RBC and plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, serum neopterin, complement system (C(3) and C(4)), ASO, CRP, rheumatoid factor, plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a), total cholesterol concentrations and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were higher in the patient group than in the control group, but they were lower in the treatment group than in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While vitamins A, E and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi> concentrations in plasma, catalase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activities and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels in RBC and plasma were lower in patient group than in the controls, they were found to be higher in the treatment group than in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results provide some evidence for a potential role of increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and decreased enzymatic and non enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in BD by its inflammatory character and vitamin E which may strengthen the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense system, and may contribute to the treatment of BD </plain></SENT>
