<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) during the past 10 years in a defined area of Northwestern Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients diagnosed as having BD at the Hospital Xeral-Calde from 1988 through 1997 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were residents of Lugo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed from the time of diagnosis until either the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or July 1, 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By that time patients were classified as having complete BD if they fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria (ISG) for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulcerations</z:e> plus one of the remaining 4 criteria of the ISG were classified as having an incomplete form of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients (9 men/7 women) were diagnosed as having complete BD and 7 (3 men) as having incomplete BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence rate of complete BD in the Lugo region of Northwestern Spain was 0.66/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Oral ulcerations</z:e> with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> were the most common initial manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological involvement was relatively frequent in men with complete BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test was less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients with neurological involvement and 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> had severe sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there was a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, apparently not related to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Northwestern Spain, BD is more common than was expected and is a nonfatal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement and severe ocular complications overshadow the good prognosis observed in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
