<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate serum prolactin levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) and correlate with phenotypic expression of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized comparative trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients fulfilling BD Research Committee criteria and 21 healthy control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified in complete-type or incomplete-type BD subgroups according to clinical characteristics such as recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, and ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, HLA phenotyping, and therapy were recorded for comparative analysis between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum prolactin levels were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on a Modular Analytics E170 analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prolactinemia was significantly higher (mean=19.34 ng/mL) in BD patients vs controls (mean=9.83 ng/mL) (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This value was also statistically higher in complete-type BD sub-group vs controls (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Younger patients (&lt;30 y) required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> plus immunosuppressives more often (75%), suggesting an association between age and disease severity, al-though not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the role of prolactin in BD pathogenesis and its association with disease expression, especially in complete-type BD </plain></SENT>
