<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to explore the predisposition of PDGFRL at the 8p21.3 locus with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and its expression level for different genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A two-stage association study was performed in 719 patients and 1,820 controls for 26 tagSNPs in the PDGFRL gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR and Bonferroni correction were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first-stage study showed that SNP rs17633132 was associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (Pc = 5.20 × 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replication and combined studies showed consistent association for rs17633132 T allele and TT genotype (replication: Pc = 3.90 × 10(-4) and 5.70 × 10(-3); combined: Pc = 2.05 × 10(-6) and 3.20 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No haplotype in PDGFRL was associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of PDGFRL in skin from rs17633132 CC genotype individuals was increased compared to that in those with the CT or TT genotype (P = 0.028, P = 0.032, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study identified a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet-disease-associated gene, PDGFRL, and suggests its involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease by modulating its transcription </plain></SENT>
