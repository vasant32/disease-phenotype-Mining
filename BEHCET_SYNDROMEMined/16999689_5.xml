<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to assess the noninvasive parameters of biventricular function derived from Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) of the tricuspid and mitral annular motion in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients with BD and 20 control subjects were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were selected to exclude those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard echocardiography and pulsed DTI were obtained in every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak systolic (13.71 +/- 2.09 vs 20.01 +/- 1.57, P &lt; 0.001), peak early diastolic (11.26 +/- 2.52 vs 15.35 +/- 2.06, P &lt; 0.001) tricuspid annular velocities were significantly lower in patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic (8.68 +/- 1.4 vs 12.25 +/- 1.7, P &lt; 0.001), peak early diastolic (7.89 +/- 1.07 vs 9.94 +/- 1.12, P &lt; 0.001), and peak end diastolic (8.30 +/- 1.32 vs 9.23 +/- 0.91, P = 0.013) lateral mitral annular velocities were significantly lower in patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that myocardial velocities, were affected in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that right and left ventricular function is impaired in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
