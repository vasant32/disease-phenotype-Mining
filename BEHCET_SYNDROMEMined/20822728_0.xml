<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The following is a case of a 22-year-old male with recurrent thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with several constitutional symptoms, including gastrointestinal discomfort, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022104" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IBS">irritable bowel syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004789'>lactose intolerance</z:hpo>, and a 2-week history of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>lower back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent an initial thoracoabdominal repair of a visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> followed by endovascular repair of a recurrent thoracic pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was initially hypothesized to be mycotic; however, further information revealed signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that BD be considered in younger patients who present with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although open repair is the traditional approach for arterial lesions in BD, the role for endovascular intervention should be considered as it represents a surgical repair with a significant reduction in morbidity </plain></SENT>
