<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Signal-transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3) gene encodes a transducer and transcription factor that plays an important role in many cellular processes such as cell growth, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several STAT3 genetic variants have been associated to different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to reveal the possible STAT3 influence in other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath> such as psoriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (PsA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The STAT3 rs744166 and rs2293152 polymorphisms were genotyped using predesigned TaqMan® assays in a total of 335 PsA patients, 217 BD patients, and 1844 ethnically matched healthy controls of Spanish Caucasian origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant association of the STAT3 rs744166(∗)G allele with PsA was observed (P-value=1.36×10(-3), OR 1.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detected effect was more evident when the rs744166(∗)GG homozygote frequencies were compared between PsA patients and controls (genotype P-value=9.77×10(-5), OR 1.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the allele and genotypic distributions of rs744166 polymorphism showed no significant differences between patients with BD and control subjects (allelic P-value=0.80, OR 1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, no evidence of association was detected between the rs2293152 genetic variant and both studied diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest for the first time that the STAT3 gene might be involved in PsA but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> predisposition </plain></SENT>
