<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We experienced one necropsy case of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> of Iizuka type (BSE) and one necropsy case of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem syndrome</z:e> (BSS) of typical neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and compared them clinically and neuropathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically both of these cases showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive mental disturbance, pseudobulbar <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001285'>spastic tetraparesis</z:hpo>, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, increased protein, and brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> observed by X-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologically, irregular, boundary-indistinct demyelinating lesions and <z:mp ids='MP_0002180'>obsolete</z:mp> softening lesions were sporadically found, associated with perivascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> centering on the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this way, both cases were similar in many points except for the presence or absence of cutaneo-muco-ocular signs specific for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also BSE and BSS reports in the literature showed that both diseases were similar not only in clinical findings consisting of mental disturbance and brainstem signs but also in neuropathological findings with similar topographical distribution of the same histopathological changes, including the variations and diversity of these characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially of much interest is their similarity in characteristic mental disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In discriminating BSE from multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and other diseases with exclusive involvement of the brainstem, it is important to understand their clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The characteristic mental disturbance includes damage to memory and sentiment, a change in personality, and lowering in spontaneity, but calculation ability and orientation are comparatively preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of course the similarity in clinical and neuropathological findings does not necessarily mean the identical etiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible to consider that neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (syndrome) may form a wide spectrum with BSE and typical neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease at the both ends, regarding the time and spatial diversity of the appearance of cutaneo-muco-ocular signs </plain></SENT>
