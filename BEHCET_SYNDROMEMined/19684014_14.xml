<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) is a rare, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, systemic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> characterised by recurrent ocular, genital and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although its aetiology is still uncertain, an intricate interplay between the environment (eg, viruses) and the host seems to initiate and/or perpetuate the disease, although the mechanism remains speculative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the identification of HLA-B*5101 (and more recently of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>) as a susceptibility locus for BD, the identification of additional genetic locus/loci, whether inside, or perhaps more importantly outside the MHC has clearly stalled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To carry out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 300 Japanese patients with BD and an equal number of controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The samples were screened using a dense panel of 23 465 microsatellites (MS) covering the entire genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The six best (of a total of 147) positively associated MS with BD were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these six, two were located within the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I region itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although one of these was clearly reminiscent of the association with HLA-B, the second, not in linkage disequilibrium with the former, was in the telomeric side of the class I region and remained to be formally identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA genotyping and haplotype analysis conclusively led to the deciphering of a dual, independent, contribution of two HLA alleles to the pathogenesis of BD: HLA-B*5101 and HLA-A*26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This GWAS highlights the premier genetic susceptibility locus for BD as the major histocompatibility complex itself, wherein reside two independent loci: HLA-B and HLA-A </plain></SENT>
