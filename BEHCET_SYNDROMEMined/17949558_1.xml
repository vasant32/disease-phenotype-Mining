<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Immunization of rats with alpha-tropomyosin (TPM) led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo>, typical features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study characterizes the arthritic features of this animal model, not previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lewis rats were immunized with bovine alpha-TPM and another group of rats was treated with neutralizing anti- <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinically more than 90% of the immunized rats developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> 12 days after vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats that were followed-up for 6 months had persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the leg joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologic studies demonstrated predominant mononuclear infiltrations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arthritic process resulted in cartilage and bone damage and abundant <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> which led to joint deformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male and female rats had a similar clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the splenocyte cytokine profile kinetics revealed a persistently high level of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and an increase in TNF-alpha secretion during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing levels of interleukin (IL)-10 heralded the decline in clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No IL-4 was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> was detected in the rats treated with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data indicates that alpha-TPM serves as an autoantigen to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> destructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This model is a TNF-alpha dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, with a Th1 cytokine profile </plain></SENT>
