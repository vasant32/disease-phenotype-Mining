<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the disease is currently unknown but evidence suggests that there is a strong genetic component mediating the chronicity of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the association between polymorphisms at position -1082, and -819 in the promoter region of the gene encoding IL-10 in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease from two distinct patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IL-10 -1082AA genotype was weakly associated with BD when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were analyzed as a group (pc = 0.04, OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), but not in the UK or Middle Eastern (ME) cohorts of patients alone compared to local controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An association with IL-10 -819T was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BD patients, (pc = 0.02, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0), and this was because of an association in the UK but not ME patients (pc = 0.0004, OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The -1082A/-819T haplotype, which is linked to low production of this cytokine, was not significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This link between BD, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, relapsing, autoinflammatory condition, and a genotype associated with low IL-10 production provides evidence that abnormalities in the genetic control of cytokine levels may be relevant in influencing the immune response in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in some patient groups </plain></SENT>
