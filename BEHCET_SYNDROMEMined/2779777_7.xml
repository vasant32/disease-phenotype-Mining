<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, brain CT revealed a low density lesion in the brain stem extending from the lower pons up to the midbrain ventrolaterally with marginal enhancement effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted image showed a high signal intensity lesion in the brain stem which mainly involved the basis ponti, tegmentum, tectum and cerebral peduncle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, the lesion became low in signal intensity with T2-weighted image and reduced in its size without enhancement in brain CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prolonged relaxation time of the lesions was gradually normalized with steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential brain CT with enhancement and MRI study with T1- and T2-weighted images were useful to detect the lesions and to evaluate the activity in the neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
