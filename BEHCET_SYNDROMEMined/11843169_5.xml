<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of cICAM-1 were measured in 44 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and in 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cICAM-1 levels were higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in the controls (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference was more marked between patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cICAM-1 levels were also higher in patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in those with inactive disease (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>cICAM-1 seems to be related to disease activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may be useful in assessing disease activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, as well as in monitoring response to treatment </plain></SENT>
