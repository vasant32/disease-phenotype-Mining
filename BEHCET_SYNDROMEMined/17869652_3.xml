<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is an idiopathic systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> that is often complicated with thrombotic features, and infectious agents have long been postulated to be a disease-triggering factor in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the distributions of IRF-1 promoter -415 C/A, -410 A/G, and -300 A/G, and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) A/G polymorphisms in 105 BD patients (mean age 41.7 +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 1.1 years, 44 male and 61 female) and in 105 gender- and age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of individual alleles and genotypes were not different between the control and BD groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of AGGG haplotype was significantly higher (73.5% vs 60.2%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.842, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.219-2.783, p(c) = 0.036) and that of the CAAG haplotype was significantly lower (2.2% vs 9.5%, OR = 0.195, 95% CI = 0.068-0.559, p(c) = 0.02) in BD patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of the AGGG haplotype was significantly higher (80.3% vs 57.4%, OR = 3.033, 95% CI = 1.716-5.360, p(c) = 0.001) and that of the CAAG haplotype was significantly lower (0.8% vs 12.3%; OR = 0.059, 95% CI = 0.010-0.357, p(c) = 0.005) in female BD patients than female controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By subgroup analyses, the CAAA haplotype tended to be more common in BD patients with moderate or severe disease than in those with mild disease (25.4% vs 13.6%, OR = 2.158, 95% CI = 1.046-4.440, p = 0.037 before Bonferroni correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When BD patients were subclassified by a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), the CAAA haplotype was found to be significantly increased the risk of DVT (42.1% vs 15.7%, OR = 3.906, 95% CI = 1.836-8.324, p(c) = 0.0015) and the AGGG haplotype tended to reduce this risk (57.9% vs 77.3%, OR = 0.403, 95% CI = 0.195-0.834, p(c) = 0.0685) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequency of the CAAA haplotype was significantly higher in BD patients that had experienced a thrombotic event than in those that had not (40.5% vs 15.5%, OR = 3.7147, 95% CI = 1.778-7.770, p(c) = 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IRF-1 is a novel susceptibility gene in BD, especially in women, and furthermore, that IRF-1 polymorphisms may be related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
