<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the progression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, gastrointestinal</z:e> involvement can be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to find out the predictive value of the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> permeability test in detecting gastrointestinal mucosal damage in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six male <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and 21 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had active disease, while nine did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Active disease was defined as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</z:hpo> (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels or at least two of the diagnostic criteria in the previous month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls were investigated with the upper gastrointestinal permeability test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, 25 were investigated endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The urine <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in patients than in the control group (P = 0.0001) and in patients with active disease than those with inactive disease (P &lt; 0.0001), while urine <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> of patients with inactive disease and the control group did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic findings were not specific to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Active and inactive BD had similar endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased upper gastrointestinal permeability was established in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This increased permeability was not related to a specific gastrointestinal BD lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies with larger series must be performed in order to determine the value of the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> permeability test in detecting mucosal involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
