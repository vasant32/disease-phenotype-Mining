<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>21 histological antigens (HLA) were typed for 30 Caucasians with BD (14 of them had <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vasculities, and 16 of them were without it) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA A and HLA B were determined by using the standard lymphocyte microcytotoxicity technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease was diagnosed in accordance with the criteria of the International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1000 healthy donors of the Middle European population were in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of occurrence of HLA B-5 was reliably higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (85.7%, PR = 5.53) and without <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (68.8%, PR = 4.44) as compared to the controls (15.5%, p &lt; 0.0000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occlusive <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was found only in BD patients with HLA B-5 (p = 0.0242) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study shows that HLA B-5 is associated with BD and can be a marker of severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
