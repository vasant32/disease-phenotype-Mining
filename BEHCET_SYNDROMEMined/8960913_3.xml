<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between either of the patient groups and the healthy control group, indicating that LMP7 allelic variation may not contribute to the pathogenesis of either <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed linkage disequilibria between LMP7 and HLA class II alleles in Japanese populations </plain></SENT>
