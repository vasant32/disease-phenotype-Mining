<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and endothelin-1 are significantly associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate whether Angiopoietin contributes to disease activity and clinical manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 59 consecutive patients with BD and sex- and age-matched 65 healthy control subjects for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed data regarding clinical features, erythrocyte sediment rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) at the time of enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of serum angiopoietin-1 are significantly increased in BD patients compared to controls (284.5+/-101.2 ng/ml of BD vs 237.1+/-76.4 ng/ml of controls, p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, serum angiopoietin-2 levels are similar in both groups (974.2+/-679.3 pg/ml of BD vs 858.3+/-535.3 pg/ml of controls, p=0.562) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum angiopoietin-1 expression is significantly elevated in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (p=0.025) and positively correlated with disease duration (r=0.320, p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ESR levels are closely associated with serum angiopoietin-2 (r=0.306, p=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Angiopoiein-1 expression is enhanced in BD patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study identifies that angiopoietin-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
