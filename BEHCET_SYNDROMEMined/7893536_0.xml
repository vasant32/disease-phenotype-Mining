<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He showed neurologic symptoms, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015464" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">facial nerve palsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>, and pathological reflexes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e>, such as euphoria, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristic neuropathologic findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the bilateral olivary nuclei with marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and proliferation of dendrites, which have been extremely rare in the reported autopsy cases of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most changes were observed in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many microspongionecrotic foci were fused to from glial scars with marked lymphocytic perivascular infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, lesions were found throughout the spinal cord; degenerative changes were found in the lateral corticospinal tract, posterior colum (especially the fasciculus gracilis), and anterior and posterior spinocerebellar tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe, on the basis of the following neuropathologic findings, that the cause of the olivary pseudohypertrophy with dendritic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and proliferation was a denervational process: (1) bilateral red nuclei were intact and (2) bilateral tegmental tracts had degenerated from the lower portion of the pons to the periphery of olivaly nuclei </plain></SENT>
