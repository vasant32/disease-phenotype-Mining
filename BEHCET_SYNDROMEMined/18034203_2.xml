<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effects of thalidomide on peripheral blood mononuclear cells were investigated ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an open prospective study, ten patients were given 200 mg/day thalidomide for 12 weeks and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), CD8, CD11a, CD11b, CD16, CD18, CD28, CD44, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD56, CD120a and gammadelta+ T cells were analysed with flow cytometry at 0, 3, 7, 30 and 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients were excluded from the analysis for attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> within the first 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At day 7, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor+ (CD120a; 12% vs 5%), CD8/CD11b+ (12% vs 6%) and CD16/CD56+ (16% vs 9%) cells decreased in BD patients compared to day 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CD4+CD45RO+ T cells (24% vs 34%) at day 30 and gammadelta+ T cells (11% vs 21%) at day 90 increased after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that thalidomide tends to decrease TNF-alpha receptor levels, CD8/CD11b+ T cells and natural killer cells in early treatment and increases CD4+CD45RO+ memory T and gammadelta+ T cells later in BD </plain></SENT>
