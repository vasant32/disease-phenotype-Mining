<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective study was to investigate hearing loss in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 20 patients (8 males, 12 females) with BD and 40 ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 20 healthy patients without BD (8 males, 12 females) and 40 ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were evaluated by an otolaryngologic examination, pure-tone and high-frequency audiometry, and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> (SNHL) was present in 25% of the ears on pure-tone audiometry and 60% of the ears on high-frequency audiometry in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the study group, at pure-tone and high-frequency audiometry, hearing thresholds were significantly higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For TEOAE values, in the BD group, each of the 1.0 to 4.0 kHz percent and amplitude values was significantly lower than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found that as age increased, hearing thresholds increased and TEOAEs decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the disease duration got longer, hearing thresholds continued to increase and otoacoustic emissions at 3.0 kHz decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In males, hearing thresholds increased more whereas emissions decreased more than in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Since SNHL is not infrequent in BD patients, patients may be evaluated regularly by pure-tone and high-frequency audiometry and TEOAEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may be possible to detect cochlear pathologies earlier than audiometric tests by TEOAEs </plain></SENT>
