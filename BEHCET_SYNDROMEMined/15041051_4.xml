<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of hearing loss in different frequencies in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients in a Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-three consecutive cases with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and 63 sex- and age-matched healty subjects as control group were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed history was taken, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent neuro-otolological, ophthalmologic and dermatologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Audiometric pure-tone thresholds at 125-8000Hz were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the two groups were statistically evaluated by Chi-square, Student's-t and McNemar tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 35 patients (55%), a hearing loss equal or more than 30dB hearing level was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>24 of 35 patients (68%) showed hearing loss in the higher frequencies (6 and 8kHz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>12 of 35 patients (34%) showed hearing loss in speech frequencies (500-2000Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relationship could be found between hearing loss and other system involvements in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also there was no correlation between hearing loss and duration of the disease, but the mean age of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with hearing loss was found to be significantly higher than the mean age of the patients without hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that presence of hearing loss in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is prevalent and represents a fourth clinical symptom after oral, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and especially there is a statistically significant hearing loss at high frequencies when compared with the speech frequencies </plain></SENT>
