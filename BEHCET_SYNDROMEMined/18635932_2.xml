<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study investigated factors associated with poor visual outcome, and the effect of various treatments on recurrence-free duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken on 99 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients (168 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual prognosis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual acuity at the first visit (&lt;0.5), presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, male gender, and posterior/<z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> type were associated with poor visual prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity at the first visit was found to be the most significant risk factor (hazard ratio = 7.392, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 9 different treatment modalities showed patients treated with steroids had longer recurrence-free periods than those not treated with steroids (p = 0.0053, t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Whilethe long-term visual prognosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> may be affected by many factors, the initial visual acuity appears to be the most significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatments involving steroids appear to decrease the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
