<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To delineate the clinical characteristics of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (NBD), a multicenter retrospective survey was performed in BD patients who had presented any neurological manifestations between 1988 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive (CP) NBD, and non-NBD was confirmed by retrospective review of clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on a total of 144 patients were collected; 76 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD, 35 with CP NBD, and 33 with non-NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-intensity lesions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were found in 60.5% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD, 54.2% with CP NBD, and 42.4% with non-NBD, whereas brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was observed in 7.5% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD, 71.4% with CP NBD, and 9.0% with non-NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count was prominently elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD, but was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in about 15% of those with CP NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the CSF cell count for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD versus non-NBD were 97.4 and 97.0%, respectively (cut-off 6.2/mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of CSF interleukin (IL)-6 for the diagnosis of CP NBD versus the recovery phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD were 86.7 and 94.7%, respectively (cut-off 16.55 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that elevation of the CSF cell count and CSF IL-6 and the presence of brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> on MRI are useful for the diagnosis of NBD </plain></SENT>
