<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists reviewed MRI studies of 34 patients with neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (NBD), 22 with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) and 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, masked to the clinical diagnosis, age and sex of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with NBD 12 were in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack; the others had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI was assessed using a set of criteria, looking at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, the site of discrete parenchymal lesions, regions of predominant involvement and the extent of the lesion(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observers also made a guess at the clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain stem and/or basal ganglia were the most predominantly involved sites in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD; 75% of these lesions were large and confluent, mainly extending from the brain stem to the diencephalon and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cases, the predominant involvement was in the brain stem and/or basal ganglia in only 36%, and in cerebral hemisphere white matter in another 36%; 27% of these patients showed no parenchymal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemisphere white-matter lesions were equally distributed between periventricular and other areas in NBD, while in MS more were periventricular, and in SLE more were nonperiventricular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was seen in 21% of patients with NBD, with a specificity of 96.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo>, its specificity was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The attempt at making a radiological diagnosis was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD and 95.5% of patients with MS, but in only 40% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of this latter groups MRI studies were interpreted as MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An extensive lesion involving the brain stem and basal ganglia seemed to be diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, hemisphere white-matter lesions could not be differentiated from those in MS </plain></SENT>
