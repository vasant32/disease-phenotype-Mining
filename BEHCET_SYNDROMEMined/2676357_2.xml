<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to guinea pig lip cytoplasmic antigens were present in 70% of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients, in 19% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients of Turkish origin (P less than 0.05), in 12% of the non <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients (P less than 0.001), in 11% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> aphtosa patients (P less than 0.05) and in 9% of the healthy controls (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet serum preincubated with the supernatant of guinea pig lip sections incubated in PBS gave an inhibition on the IIF test, indicating that the antigen involved in a soluble cytoplasmic substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant increase in the presence of antibodies against iris, cornea or retina (mouse eye) were detected in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of interest was the finding of a positive reaction in 6 out of 10 patients in the episcleral region of the mouse eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This positive reaction resembles immune complex like material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that using the external surface of the guinea pig lip as a substrate is useful in selecting out those patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients with an unknown etiology and from patients with aphtous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
