<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CARD15 has recently been identified as the first susceptibility gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Given certain clinical and pathological similarities between CD and BD, and recent evidence of linkage of BD to the CARD15 genomic region, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of CARD15 variants in determining susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 374 BD patients from three ethnically homogeneous cohorts (white English, Turkish, and Middle Eastern Arabs of Palestinian and Jordanian descent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation detection of CARD15 was performed by direct sequencing in a subset of patients from each group and the identified variants were genotyped in the complete cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case-control analyses were carried out with additional stratification by the BD-associated allele, HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutation detection identified six previously described CARD15 polymorphisms at a frequency of &gt; 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, two of the three CD-associated polymorphisms were present, but at low frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of haplotypes, constructed from nine genotyped polymorphisms, demonstrated significant variation between different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, case-control analyses demonstrated no association between the CARD15 polymorphisms and susceptibility to BD, irrespective of HLA-B*51 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CARD15 variant alleles are not associated with susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other shared loci, currently under investigation, may determine susceptibility to both CD and BD </plain></SENT>
