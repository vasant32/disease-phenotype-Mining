<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test whether the coexistence of familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is more frequent than expected and whether each disease affects the severity of the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 353 charts of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> to detect individuals with concomitant BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 152 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> over the age of 18 years were also interviewed and examined specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied 53 patients with BD, looking for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and for their MEFV mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared BD patients with MEFV mutations to those without them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of 353 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> was found to have concomitant BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with BD bore MEFV mutations, 2 of whom were symptomatic homozygotes and had concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient with BD with a single MEFV mutation had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both BD groups (with or without MEFV mutations) were similar in their clinical manifestations and disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> are 2 separate entities that have a mild trend toward a higher than expected association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was no mutual effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> on BD or vice versa </plain></SENT>
