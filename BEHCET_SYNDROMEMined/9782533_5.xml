<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leucocyte-leucocyte and leucocyte-endothelial cell interactions are critical in inflammatory reactions that are influenced by the expression, activation and shedding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (E- and L-selectin, VLA-4, ICAM-1, PECAM-1, VCAM-1 and CD18 and CD11c chains of beta-2 integrins) on endothelial and inflammatory cells by immunohistochemistry on cryostat sections of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum lesions taken from 15 patients with BD and 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum of unknown cause </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major histopathological findings were perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and secondary vasculitic changes with no difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> was higher in BD (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial and inflammatory cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression did not show any significant difference between groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although VCAM-1 expression and intensity on endothelial cells of BD patients seemed to be lower, this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> is an important feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum like lesions in BD, which is almost impossible to understand by physical examination alone </plain></SENT>
