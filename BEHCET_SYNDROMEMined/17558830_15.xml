<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of daclizumab (Zenapax, humanized anti-Tac, HAT) in controlling the ocular manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen participants with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease experiencing at least two prior ocular attacks and requiring treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> for the ocular complications of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants received either intravenous placebo or daclizumab (1 mg/kg) infusions every two weeks for six weeks, then every four weeks while continuing their standard immunosuppressive regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If clinically indicated, tapering of the standard immunosuppressive medications was allowed after six months of study enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete ocular and physical examinations and an adverse event assessment were performed at baseline and prior to each study infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary safety endpoints were the development of a life-threatening complication or a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy outcomes were the number of ocular attacks and an assessment of systemic immunosuppressive medications required during the study, including the ability to taper concomitant immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: Nine participants randomized to daclizumab and eight to placebo were followed monthly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from one to 34 months, with a median follow-up of 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two participants randomized to daclizumab discontinued study therapy prior to the end of the study for personal reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No participant experienced a safety endpoint, and visual acuity remained stable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants during the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ten participants (six daclizumab, four placebo) experienced ocular attacks requiring therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median ocular attack rate during the study was greater in the daclizumab arm than the placebo arm (median 1.27 vs. 0.17 attacks/year, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Participants in the placebo arm also experienced a greater reduction in the immunosuppressive medication score compared to participants receiving daclizumab (median -4.0 vs. -1.0, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed results in the placebo group demonstrate that careful follow-up and treatment with standard combination immunosuppressive therapy can be effective for the management of the ocular complications of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In our small study, there was no suggestion that daclizumab was beneficial in comparison with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, the low observed attack rate limited our ability to make a definitive treatment group comparison </plain></SENT>
