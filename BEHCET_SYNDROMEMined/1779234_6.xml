<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a 63-year-old man who developed left homonymous hemianopsia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> 16 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cardinal symptoms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT, MRI and PET studies disclosed cerebral lesion with reduced neuronal metabolism in the right hemisphere, which was resolved by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed no filling of the right Rolandic, anterior and posterior parietal and angular arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postmortem study revealed: (a) occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234959" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">panarteritis</z:e> of some medium-sized pial branches of the right middle cerebral artery, considered as angio-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's pathology, and small infarctions due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>; (b) patchy or confluent demyelinated foci with perivascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> in the bilateral brain basis, predominantly in the right retro- and sublenticular structures, being equivalent to neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angio- and neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndromes could have occurred and progressed concomitantly, which suggests a close relationship between the two subclassified processes </plain></SENT>
