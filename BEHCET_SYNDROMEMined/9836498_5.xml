<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Soluble Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 was quantified using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased serum sFas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 levels were observed in active BD, compared with inactive BD, RA patients and SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased serum sFas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 levels were correlated with the presence of neurologic manifestations or pulmonary involvement in active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, increased levels of sFas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 occurred frequently and exclusively in active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary evidence suggested that elevated levels of sFas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1 are associated with the clinical stage and clinical manifestations in BD </plain></SENT>
