<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The field survey was performed in two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first stage 7,389 students (3,847 females and 3,542 males) were asked to fill out a questionnaire in the classroom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the questionnaire, filtering questions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> (the presence of recurrent attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo>/swelling, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>) and BD (presence of aphthous stomatatis) were asked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second stage consisted of two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first, 3225 questionnaires were completed by 1778 female and 1447 male students calculated according to the zero patient design, who were selected randomly from among 7389 students for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Students with any suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were called to the hospital for detailed investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second step the remaining students were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 3225 children questioned in the first step, 156 claimed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo>/swelling with accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, which might suggest the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> However, this diagnosis was excluded after further clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second step 152 students were called for detailed investigation: 2 patients, one 10 years and the other 12 years old, were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None were diagnosed to have <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> in Turkey in general is about 0.093% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate found in this survey was lower (0.027%) which may be due to the historic background of the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is the first study that has shown that the "zero patient design" can be used in an epidemiological survey </plain></SENT>
