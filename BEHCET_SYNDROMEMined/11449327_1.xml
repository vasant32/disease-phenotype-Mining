<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Familial occurrence has been reported in approximately 8% of Turkish patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the clinical course of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease among siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied five pairs of siblings with ocular involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other family member of these siblings had any symptom of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The siblings comprised three sister-brother pairs, one sister-sister pair, and one brother-brother pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a 5-10-year difference between the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ocular disease among siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the five pairs (two sister-brother, one brother-brother) had a dissimilar course of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female siblings had an earlier age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and tended to have a worse prognosis than their brothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is generally acknowledged that male sex is associated with a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study, however, we observed that, among siblings with a dissimilar course, female patients were more severely affected than male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poor ocular prognosis in a patient does not indicate aggressive treatment in his/her sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe that each sibling should be managed on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
