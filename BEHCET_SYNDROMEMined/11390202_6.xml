<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been postulated that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 is associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous study, we induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-like symptoms in ICR mice inoculated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, several inbred mouse strains -- B10.BR (H-2k), B10.RIII (H-2r), C57BL/6 (H-2b), C3H/He (H-2k), Balb/c (H-2d) -- which had different types of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), were inoculated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 (KOS strain) in order to demonstrate the role of histocompatibility antigen in the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-like symptoms developed in 40-50% of B10.BR, B10.RIII and C57BL/6 strains, but in only 2% of C3H/He and Balb/c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B10.BR and C3H/He strains had a common haplotype (H-2k) but the rate of manifestation was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>So, we conclude that MHC is not directly correlated with development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-like symptoms in the animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus induced <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
