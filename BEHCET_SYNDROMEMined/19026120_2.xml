<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a unique systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> involving both arteries and veins of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) are important in mediating various immune effector functions, FcgammaR gene polymorphisms may affect the susceptibility to systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> such as BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to show the distribution of FcgammaRIIa, IIIa ve IIIb receptor gene polymorphisms in BD, and to investigate possible genotype-phenotype relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, FcgammaRIIa (H/H131, H/R131, R/R131), IIIa (F/F158, F/V158, V/V158), and IIIb (NA1/NA1, NA1/NA2, and NA2/NA2) receptor gene polymorphisms were investigated in 216 unrelated Turkish BD patients (M/F: 130/86) and in 241 healthy subjects, using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FcgammaRIIa R/R131 (p=0.019) and FcgammaRIIIa F/F158 genotypes (p=0.001) were found to be significantly more frequent in BD compared with healthy controls, whereas the FcgammaRIIIb genotypes were not (p=0.108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele analysis showed that the FcgammaRIIIa 158 (p=0.001) and FcgammaRIIIb NA2 (p=0.016) alleles were more frequent in BD than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BD patients the FcgammaRIIIa V/V158 genotype was significantly associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (p=0.002) and with an earlier disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p=0.008), while the FcgammaRIIIb NA2/NA2 genotype was significantly associated with disease severity (p=0.02), vascular involvement (p=0.014), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that the genotype frequencies and allelic distributions of the FcgammaRIIa, FcgammaRIIIa and FcgammaRIIIb gene polymorphisms were significantly different between BD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, certain FcgammaRIIIa and FcgammaRIIIb gene polymorphisms appear to be associated with an early disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, disease severity, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and vascular involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
