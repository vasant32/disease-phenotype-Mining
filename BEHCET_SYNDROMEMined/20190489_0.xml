<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with neuro <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) initially presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and severe hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 51-year-old man with no noteworthy past history was hospitalized for evaluation of non-pulsating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture on admission only showed slight pleocytosis (6 /microL, monomorphonuclear cells predominantly) but no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, after admission, he continued to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of over 38 degrees, and he developed painful oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406191" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudofolliculitis</z:e> on the upper limbs and trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to admission he had often experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> and had bought commercially available mouthwash for prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was observed at the blood collection site, leading to the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the seventh hospital day, the patient developed sudden hearing loss, which was diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0008625'>severe sensorineural hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lumbar puncture was performed again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild pleocytosis (60 /microL, predominantly monomorphonuclear cells), with high CSF IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither edematous change nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the brainstem was noted and there were no other abnormal findings on the brain MRI/MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Auditory brainstem response was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, suggesting that the patient had developed hearing loss due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the hearing loss was likely due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This case is considered to be a rare case of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease caused by severe hearing loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
