<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to correlate TLR2 expression and chemotactic responses stimulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in BD neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we assessed expressions of TLR2 and the correlate receptors CD14, CD114 (G-CSF receptor), CD116 (GM-CSF receptor) and also TLR4 on circulating neutrophils and monocytes of patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum concentration of soluble CD14 (sCD14) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil chemotactic responses from BD patients and healthy controls under LTA stimulation were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receptor expressions were measured by flow cytometry, neutrophil chemotaxis was assessed in a Boyden chamber and sCD14 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TLR2 expression was higher only on BD monocytes compared with healthy controls (39.9 +/- 13.1 vs. 33.6 +/- 5.3, p = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expressions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other receptors were similar in BD and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest, TLR2 expression on neutrophils was similar in both groups and, when stimulated with LTA, BD neutrophils showed chemotactic responses similar to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils exhibited increased chemotaxis only when incubated with BD plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum sCD14 concentration was higher in BD patients than in controls (1,920.8 +/- 563.6 vs. 1,623.2 +/- 391.3 ng/ml, p = 0.008), and it was positively correlated with both CD14 expression on circulating monocytes membrane (p = 0.035) and BDCAF scores (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, isolated BD neutrophils do not overexpress TLR2 neither overreact to LTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, because TLR2 expression was higher on BD monocytes, sCD14 from monocyte origin correlated with disease activity and neutrophil hyperchemotaxis occurred on strict dependence of plasmatic soluble factors, we suggest a possible role for <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stimulation of monocytes via TLR2 producing neutrophil-stimulating pro-inflammatory factors in BD </plain></SENT>
