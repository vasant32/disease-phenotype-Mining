<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the previously reported association of HLA-B51 with the manifestations and severity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 148 consecutive BD patients (89 male, 59 female) with a minimum disease duration of 5 yr followed up at an out-patient BD clinic in a tertiary referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into three severity groups (mild, moderate, severe) using a modified form of the BD total activity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-B alleles were determined by DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction and sequential hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> [odds ratio (OR)=3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-7.5], skin findings (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo>-like lesions) (OR=4.4, 95% CI 1.1-17.7), a positive skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (OR=3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.9) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> (OR=1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.7) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher in B*51-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, no significant association was observed between B*51 positivity and a severe disease course, and B*51 homozygosity did not exhibit a prominent association with the severity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male sex was found to be the strongest determinant of the severity of BD by logistic regression analysis (OR=4.7, 95% CI 1.9-11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HLA-B*51 does not exhibit a strong association with a more severe disease course in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The involvement of other genetic and/or environmental factors seems to be required and to be more important than B*51 for the progression of BD </plain></SENT>
