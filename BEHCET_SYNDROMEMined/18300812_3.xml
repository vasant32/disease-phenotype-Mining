<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, clinicopathologic features have not been characterized clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we present clinicopathologic characteristics of this uncommon disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients included 8 males and 4 females, ranging from 24 to 52 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were presented with abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and were mostly diagnosed as having cardiac <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease later in the course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon echocardiography, 8 patients showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> with redundant prolapsing aortic cusps and 4 patients showed irregular mass lesions in the right ventricular cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No one had both lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aortic root was also involved with aortic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1410758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">valvulitis</z:e>, showing severe mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of various stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were frequent microabscess and extensive endothelial loss with fibrinous deposit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The right heart lesions showed similar histopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients who initially underwent simple aortic valve replacement developed serious postoperative complications requiring reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No serious complications developed after the treatment was changed to a replacement of aortic root with extensive debridement and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cardiac <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is presented as aortic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1410758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">valvulitis</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> or inflammatory mass lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Characteristic echocardiographic and pathologic findings seem to be helpful for the timely diagnosis of this critical disease </plain></SENT>
