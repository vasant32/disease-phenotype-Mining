<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients (80%) showed some degree of hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The averaged pure tone audiogram of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group showed statistically significant auditory deficits in comparison with that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of either the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> group showed any hearing deterioration during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients under CyA therapy demonstrated improvement in their hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference between the two groups of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients (CyA versus conventional treatment) was found to be statistically significant (p less than .05) </plain></SENT>
