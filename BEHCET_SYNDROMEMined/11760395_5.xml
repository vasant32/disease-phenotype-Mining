<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This case-control study was undertaken to evaluate the association of HLA-B51 antigen and its allelic types with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>), to investigate the degree of this association with diagnostic types and clinical variables of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The DNA typing of HLA-B51 by nested PCR-SSP was performed in 61 patients with BD, 56 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and in 70 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, blind quality control study was done to assess the accuracy of nested PCR-SSP in HLA-B51-positive and negative BD patients on the microlymphocytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, direct DNA sequencing analysis was carried out in HLA-B51-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The outcome of nested PCR-SSP showed 100% concordance with those of the microlymphocytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of HLA-B51 in patients with BD was 55.7%, 16.1% in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and 15.7% in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the diagnostic types of BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ten patients with complete BD had HLA-B51 antigen, and 47.1% in patients with incomplete BD (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the prevalence of HLA-B51 was statistically significant in patients with BD who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.003) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Direct DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the major allelic types in BD, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and in healthy control were mostly HLA-B*51011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> or healthy controls, prevalence of HLA-B51 in the Korean patients with BD was much higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BD patients with B51 seemed to be susceptible for manifesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, and the full-blown syndrome as complete BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore the presence of HLA-B51 antigen in BD patients would be a genetic marker for the severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no difference on the major allelic types of HLA-B51 in BD, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and in healthy control </plain></SENT>
