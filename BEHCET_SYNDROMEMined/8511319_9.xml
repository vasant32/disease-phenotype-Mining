<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the characteristic radiographic findings and serial radiographic changes in nonsurgical cases of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD), seven patients were followed up for an average of 4 1/2 years (range, 8 months to 11 years 4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They underwent repeated examination with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> meal studies and double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema meal studies and double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial radiography revealed one to three deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in the terminal ileum or ileocecal region in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> healed while patients were treated with medical therapy but recurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four of these five patients, follow-up radiography demonstrated various changes within each case: At each examination, an enlarged <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> or a newly developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was often found in conjunction with a healed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other two patients, multiple shallow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> or innumerable aphthoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were seen throughout the entire colon, and these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> showed a good response to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that serial radiographic changes in patients with intestinal BD may mimic those in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn disease</z:e>, with findings in the terminal ileum and colon that wax and wane with medical treatment </plain></SENT>
