<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We have study the various associations between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and alleles HLA class I and II in Moroccan population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of HLA alleles involved in the disease is assessed according to clinical signs and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease have been compared to healthy controls matched by age and ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HLA typing has been conducted by using microlymphocytotoxicity for the class I (A and B) and molecular biology (polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers) for the class II (DR and DQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In addition to the allele B51, -A2, -B5102, -B58 and -B72 predispose to the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and the alleles A23, -A33, -B18, -B41 and -B49 have a negative correlation in our Moroccan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alleles A2 and -B72 are specific to men, -A68 and -B58 to women, whereas -B51 and -B5102 are predisposing to the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease of both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The allele B51 is related to the mucous manifestations, -B72 to the vascularitis manifestations and -B58 to the cutaneous manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The haplotypes A2-B51 has a high positive correlation with this <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning class II, none of the alleles DRB1* is implicated in the pathology even though the allele DQB1*02 ensures the patients' protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The allele HLA-B51 shows a high positive correlation with the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other genetic factors seem to be implicated in susceptibility or protection against the disease </plain></SENT>
