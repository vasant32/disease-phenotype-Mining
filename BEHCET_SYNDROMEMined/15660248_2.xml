<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with NB disease were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen healthy volunteers were examined as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging of the head was performed without and with magnetization transfer (MT) contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signal intensity measurements were obtained from ten anatomical regions (centrum semiovale, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, internal capsule, forceps major, forceps minor, thalamus, substantia nigra pars compacta, substantia nigra pars grisea, inferior pons and middle cerebellar peduncle) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also measured in the NB group were parenchymal lesions in the brain stem, basal ganglia and cerebral deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MTR was calculated for each measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U and independent t-tests with computer-based SPSS 11.0 for Windows software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A P value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean MTR of the parenchymal lesions in the NB group was lower than the mean MTR of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing parenchyma in both the NB patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing parenchyma the mean MTR in the NB group was higher than that for the controls for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions except the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata; however, the difference was statistically significant only for the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The MRI-visible parenchymal involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease causes a decrease in MTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing brain, although lacking statistical significance for the most regions studied, the tendency for higher MTR in NB patients compared with controls may offer an insight into the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
