<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e> of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurrent and painful episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulcerations</z:e> interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> plaque accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plaque, sulcular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared to healthy subjects (P &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in controls (P &lt;0.001-0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 compared to controls (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0399451" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subgingival plaque</z:e> were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
