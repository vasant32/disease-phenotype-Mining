<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurological impairment and disability were quantified by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging included spine and brain MRI and brain SPECT by radiolabeling <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> (Tc99m) Ethyl Cisteynate Dimer (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease progression halted after treatment in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 48 months of follow-up they were therapy-free and one showed neurological status and disability improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI findings were unchanged in both patients, but SPECT-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> showed an increase of blood flow in the hypoperfused cerebral areas in the ameliorated patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immune ablation followed by APBSCT can modify the course of severe N-BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the high risk and the transplant-related mortality, these cases have to be carefully selected </plain></SENT>
