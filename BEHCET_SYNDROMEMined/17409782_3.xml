<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess cochlear functions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) using otoacoustic emission testing (OAE), which objectively assesses outer hair cells in the cochlea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (n = 16) and RA (n = 11) as well as 20 controls were tested using pure tone audiometry and transiently evoked (TEOAEs) and distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pure tone results in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group were not significantly different from controls (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pure tone results in the RA group were significantly different than in controls at 250, 500 and 6,000 Hz (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TEOAEs could be obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DPOAE amplitudes in the RA group and controls were similar (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DPOAE amplitudes were significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group than in controls at 1 and 2 kHz (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A subtle deterioration in hearing can be seen at low and high frequencies in RA, which is not related to outer hair cell dysfunction as detected by DPOAE testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who have hearing thresholds within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits, outer hair cell functions seem spared with an increased activity in the apical regions of the cochlea </plain></SENT>
