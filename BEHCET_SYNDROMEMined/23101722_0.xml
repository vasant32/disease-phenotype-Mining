<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To measure the levels of interleukin (IL)-27, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-17 in serum and supernatants of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) compared with healthy subjects, and to evaluate the effect of recombinant human IL-27 (rhIL-27) on IFN-γ and IL-17 production by PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three patients with BD and 40 healthy controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 and their production by PBMCs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with the effects of levels of rhIL-27 on IFN-γ and IL-17 production by PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significantly higher levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 in sera of patients with BD compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 in BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were significantly higher than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 production by stimulated PBMCs was increased in BD patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of rhIL-27, stimulation of PBMCs from BD patients resulted in decreased production of IL-17 but increased production of IFN-γ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IL-27, IFN-γ, and IL-17 play a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
