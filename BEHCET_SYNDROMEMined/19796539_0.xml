<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (F/M:36/22) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline and follow-up data were collected by clinical examinations and questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients rated their global impression of change (PGIC) measured by a transitional question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCII was defined as the difference in mean change from baseline in OHIP-14 between patients with no response to therapy and patients with next higher level of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately one third (29.3 %) of the patients expressed an improvement during control examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between raw change in OHIP-14 score and change in number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (r=0.69 p=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inactive patients increased from 44.1% in baseline to 58.8% in follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A trend towards decreased number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> was observed in follow-up (0.64+/-0.93) compared to baseline (1.44+/-1.92) in the improved group (p=0.096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to regression analysis, PGIC was a significant predictor of change in raw OHIP-14 score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The threshold levels generated from the ROC analyses in OHIP-14 score best associated with clinically important improvement were -3.5 points (sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 88.6%) and -38.1% (sensitivity: 86.7%, specificity: 97.1%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Changes in OHIP-14 scores seem to be a sensitive and valuable tool for the determination of MCII during follow-up of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral disease</z:e> assessment </plain></SENT>
