<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, antinuclear and anticardiolipin autoantibodies were determined in the sera of both patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finally, HLA-B51 positivity was assessed in the patients and in a historical control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was observed in 50% and proximal aorta <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in 30% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the rate of these abnormalities in comparison with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular function parameters were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positivity rate of antinuclear and anticardiolipin autoantibodies was very low (7%), without differences between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 was detected in 82.7% of the patients versus 21.7% in the control group (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study demonstrates a high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
