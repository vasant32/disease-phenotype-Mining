<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of the HLA-B*5101 in the pathogenesis of BD is elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The assumption that HLA-B*5101 has an active role in BD is suggestive, but no antigen has yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential binding capacity of various antigens to the HLA-B*5101 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using bioinformatics programs, we studied the binding capacity of HLA-B*5101 and its corresponding rat molecule RT.A1 to the following antigens: heatshock protein-60 (HSP60), major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>), <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> S-antigen (S-Ag), HLA-B27 molecule and its <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) and tropomyosin (TPM), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which serve as antigens in animal models corresponding to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In each protein including the B*5101 molecule itself, the computerized programs revealed several short sequences with potential high binding capacity to HLA-B*5101 with the exception of B-27PD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rat MHC RT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Al. had no binding capacity to S-Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated proteins have the potential to bind to and to serve as potential antigens to the HLA-B*5101 and the rat MHC RT1.Al. molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathogenicity of these suggested short <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> should be evaluated in animal models of BD </plain></SENT>
