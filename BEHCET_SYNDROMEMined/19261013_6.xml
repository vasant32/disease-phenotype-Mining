<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Interleukin-8 (IL-8) has been shown previously to associate with different individual clinical manifestations and activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), but its association with vascular involvement has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five untreated patients with BD and 29 healthy individuals were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activity of patients was based on the existence of two or more symptoms and a statistically significantly high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> Activity Index (BDAI) at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-8, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) results were evaluated with respect to activity, vascular involvement, and other specific individual clinical manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-8 levels were found to be significantly elevated in active BD compared with inactive BD (P = 0.006) and healthy controls (P = 0.000), with median values of 267 (53-2000), 137 (52-290), and 58 pg/mL (53-160 pg/mL), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike ESR and CRP, IL-8 levels showed a high correlation with BDAI scores (r = 0.743, P = 0.00) and the number of active clinical manifestations (r = 0.646, P = 0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-8 were increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, eye lesions, and vascular lesions, with median values and significance levels of 254.5 (53-2000), P = 0.05; 254.5 (52-1400), P = 0.03; 254.5 (72-2000), P = 0.029; and 593 pg/mL (110-2000 pg/mL), P = 0.001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, IL-8 levels in the active patient group with vascular involvement were significantly higher than the levels in those without vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum IL-8 levels are increased in the active phase of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This marker may be useful in the early detection of vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
