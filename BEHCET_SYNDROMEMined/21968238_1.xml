<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term effect of infliximab on ocular and extraocular manifestations in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and treated with infliximab at Aichi Medical University Hospital for more than 18 months were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated visual acuity, the average number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks involving the posterior segment, and general disease activity every 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) was used for an overall index of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-infliximab antibody levels were examined in the patients' sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The follow-up period after initial introduction of infliximab ranged from 19 to 40 months (mean ± SD, 32 ± 8.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of infliximab infusions ranged from 12 to 24 (19 ± 4.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By the 2-month follow-up, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks involving the posterior segment and the BDCAF scores were significantly improved compared to the 2 months before introducing infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-infliximab antibodies were detected in the sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant long-term improvement in both the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks involving the posterior segment and overall disease activity was provided by the administration of infliximab to patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, despite the presence of anti-infliximab antibodies </plain></SENT>
