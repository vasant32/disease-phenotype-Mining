<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of neurological involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and to determine a subgroup of patients at high risk for this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical notes of 105 patients with BD fulfilling the criteria of the international Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (group 1) or not (group 2) of neurological and/or psychiatric involvement attributable to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The epidemiological, clinical and genetic (HLA B51 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> 6 frequency) features in the two groups were analysed and compared using the Kruskall-Wallis and the chi-square tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (25.7%) had clinical evidence of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were 20 men and 7 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at neurological <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 34.26 +/- 8.79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (70.3%) had meningoparenchymal "MP" central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement (brainstem: 9, hemispheric involvement: 6, spinal cord: 4, psychiatric involvement: 2, isolated pyramidal signs: 1, aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>: 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (25.9%) had cerebral large vessels involvement that is cerebral angio-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet "CAB" (intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>: 5 cases due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>: 3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>: 2, cerebral haemorrhage: 1, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>: 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient (3.7%) had both "MP" and "CAB" involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in non-parenchymal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group 1, complete recovery or improvement with mild neurological impairment was seen in 13 cases, improvement with severe disability in 3 cases, worsening in 1 case, the course was stationary in 1 case and 3 patients died (11.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were significantly more frequent in "CAB" subgroups than in subgroup 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Frequency of neurological involvements in BD was high in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> seem to be a risk factor to these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angio-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet appears to be a protector factor against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
