<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is hard to predict in which patient the eyes will be involved and what the outcome will be </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we assessed various risk factors for eye involvement and attempted to predict the visual outcome in our patient population in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a total of 224 patients with BD, diagnosed between 1982 and 1996, were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed physical examination and ophthalmologic work up were performed on each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors that might contribute to eye involvement were investigated, after which prognostic factors for vision were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients had eye involvement during a median follow-up of 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of involvement was highest within the first year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Young age was the most significant factor for eye involvement (P &lt; 0.0001), but vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement, and male gender were other risk factors (P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.01; and P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most important determinant for the prognosis of vision was <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and an age of &lt; or = 32 were other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of eye involvement and prognosis for vision were similar with different treatment regimens (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the first 2 years after diagnosis is the most critical period for eye involvement, and conventional forms of therapy generally are unsuccessful in preventing such involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It seems reasonable to treat patients who are at increased risk for eye involvement more aggressively, especially within the first 2 years of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
