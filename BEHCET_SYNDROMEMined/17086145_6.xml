<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the clinical patterns of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet (NB) and to compare them with different clinical features of 925 BD registered in the same period and the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients of NB fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>93 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, without other neurological symptoms were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings were supported by cerebrospinal fluid, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NB was present in 16.64p.cent of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sex ratio male/female: 4.31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients with NB was 31.76 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of NB was 29.83 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of the NB disease was 3.81 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings were categorised in 2 main types: parenchymal and non-parenchymal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some patients had features of both types (mixed patterns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>94 patients (61.03p.cent) presented with parenchymal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common findings were pyramidal signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007024'>pseudobulbar syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mixed patterns were observed in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>Erythema</z:hpo> nodosum and vascular involvement were more frequent in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Other clinical features were reported: pure meningeal pattern in 15 cases, pure peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement in 4 cases, isolated cranial nerves in 8 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> in one patient and pseudotumor of cervical medulla in other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>6 cases of juvenile BD and one case of familial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>133 patients were treated (86.36p.cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of treatment was 7.46 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> (cyclophosphamid, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
