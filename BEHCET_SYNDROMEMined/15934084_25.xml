<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A strong association between an HLA class I antigen, HLA-B51, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease has long been known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of multicase families has suggested a substantial contribution of non-HLA loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to perform a whole-genome linkage analysis for identification of other susceptibility loci for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in multicase families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised a total of 193 individuals (90 male, 103 female) from 28 multicase families of Turkish origin; 83 of the subjects (50 males, 33 females) fulfilled the International Study Group criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hundred ninety-five highly informative microsatellite markers spanning the genome were genotyped using fluorescent polymerase chain reaction primers and a fully automated electrophoresis platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the first analysis, 33 additional markers that were located close to the peak linkage areas were genotyped in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric multipoint linkage analysis was carried out using GeneHunter version 2.1 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidence for linkage (P &lt; or = 0.05) was obtained in 16 chromosome regions: 1p36, 4p15, 5q12, 5q23, 6p22-24, 6q16, 6q25-26, 7p21, 10q24, 12p12-13, 12q13, 16q12, 16q21-23, 17p13, 20q12-13, and Xq26-28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the addition of further markers, the maximum nonparametric linkage score increased from 3.5 to 3.94 at 12p12-13 (D12S77; P = 0.0002) and from 3.07 to 3.70 at 6p22-24 (D6S285; P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first systematic genome screen in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and provides evidence of linkage to several non-HLA susceptibility loci in a cohort of Turkish multicase families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This represents the first step toward the identification of novel <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease susceptibility genes </plain></SENT>
