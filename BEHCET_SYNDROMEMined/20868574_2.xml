<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We investigated the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) among the ethnic Armenians in Istanbul using Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) as a comparator disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also studied HLA-B51 and MEFV mutations among a group of healthy Armenians and a non-Armenian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence study was conducted in 2 parts in the Armenian primary schools in Istanbul, using the enrolled students as index cases to study the core family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Part I, a questionnaire seeking only whether either parent had previously been diagnosed as having BS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> by a physician was distributed to a total of 1873 index students registered at 10 schools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1380 parents filled in the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 37% (1380 / 3746) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Part II, eight schools participated with a response rate of 83 % (1183/1428) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, genomic DNA samples of 108 healthy (14 M/94 F) Armenians and 97 (45 M/ 52 F) non-Armenians, were studied for HLAB51 and MEFV gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Part I, none of the parents turned out to have been diagnosed as BS, whereas a total of 12 / 1380 (870/105) had been diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second part the estimated prevalence of BS was 90 /105 and that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> was 760/ 105 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 carrier rate was found to be similar between the Armenian (27%, 29/108) and the non-Armenian participants (19%, 18/97), (p=0.158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall carrier rate of MEFV gene mutations was significantly higher in the Armenian group (36% vs. 20%, p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The genetic load for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> is considerably higher among the Armenians when compared to the load for BS among the same ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the rather low frequency of BS among the Armenians when compared to the frequency among the general population living in the same environment is further evidence for a genetic predisposition to BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HLA- B51 does not seem to play a dominant role in the said predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, as we have used an unorthodox epidemiological methodology in data collection our results might need to be further verified by more conventional methods </plain></SENT>
