<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recurrent mucocutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> the results were very good, with fast disappearance of pain, healing of the ahthae and disappearance or delay of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The result in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is similar, possibly less, in mucocutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> also reacts favorably but we can not say that the results were superior to those obtained by other drugs (corticoids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatics</z:chebi> immunosuppressives), although its side effects are less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand it does not appear to have any effect on other symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> is active), thromboflebitis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is not sufficient experience to judge its action on neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recommended dose is 100 mgr./day for 10 days, a higher dose does not appear to give better results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who have received treatment several times appear to have the same results, but slower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxicity has not been observed and the only side effect which has been noted is digestive intolerance in two cases, after which the medication was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors consider that Thalidomide, with due precaution, which must be scrupulously determined, is the most active <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52217">medicament</z:chebi> in particularly severe cases with profusion of necrotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e>, mutilating and recurring mucocutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e>, also being useful in controlling some symptoms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
