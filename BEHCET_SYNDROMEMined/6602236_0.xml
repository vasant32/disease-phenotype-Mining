<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher level of CICs was observed in the patients than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concerning the correlation between the levels of CICs and the stages of the ocular attack, the levels were significantly higher in the preattack stage and the early stage of the attack than in the late stage and the remission phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high level of CICs was associated with the patients of the fulminant form of ocular attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that immune complexes may play a role in the development of the ocular attack of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
