<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association of the genetic polymorphism of IL-8 and BD, we genotyped IL-8 -845 T/C, -738 T/A, -353 A/T, -251 A/T, +293 G/T, +678 T/C and receptors CXCR-1 +2607 G/C and CXCR-2 +785 C/T polymorphisms in 119 Korean patients with BD and 119 age- and sex-matched healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes were analyzed between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no SNPs associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of haplotype TAT inferred from SNPs, IL-8 -353 A/T, -251 A/T and +678 T/C, was significantly higher in patients with BD than controls (5.9 vs 0.0%, P = 0.0001), as was haplotype ATC (6.7 vs 0.0%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The haplotype difference was still valid in human leukocyte antigen-B51-negative subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found a significant difference in the distribution of IL-8 gene haplotypes between patients with BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the genetic polymorphisms of proinflammatory chemokine IL-8 can contribute to the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
