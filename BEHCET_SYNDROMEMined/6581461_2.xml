<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data representing volume fractions and the numerical density of cellular and other infiltrate components demonstrated that (1) the infiltrate under the epithelium lateral to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> is different from that at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>'s center, (2) at both sites, composition of the gross infiltrate does not change with age of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, (3) a large population of leukocytes (about 18% in the lateral and 23% in the central region) belong to the monocyte/macrophage series, (4) blast-forming T-lymphocytes are consistently present, blast-forming B-lymphocytes and plasma cells are very rare, and (5) mast cells are several times more numerous than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a comparison of the infiltrates of Mikulicz <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> with those of herpetiform and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, it appears that the pathogenesis of the various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulcerations</z:e> may well be diverse </plain></SENT>
