<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involvement of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12 in BD has been shown before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, IL-12 shares a p40 subunit with IL-23, which has additional inflammatory effects apart of IL-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-23 increases neutrophils' transmigration and therefore could contribute in BD induction or progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, endothelial cells express vascular endothelial cadherin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (VE-cadherin), which plays critical roles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and endothelial integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VE-cadherin may shed into the circulation in a soluble form (sVE-cadherin), and inflammatory cytokines can increase this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a correlation between IL-23 concentration and amount of sVE-cadherin was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 44 healthy persons and 53 patients with BD of different disease activities and examined their serum concentrations of IL-23 and sVE-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the concentrations of these two factors among patients only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparing sVE-cadherin mean concentration in patients and controls showed a significant difference, which for IL-23 was not considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results showed higher IL-23 in sera of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a meaningful correlation between IL-23 content and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results could extend the biological effects of IL-23 in BD and introduce sVE-cadherin as a potential new biomarker in the course of BD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
