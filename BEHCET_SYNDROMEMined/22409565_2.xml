<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 26 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of their first symptoms was before age 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They fulfilled the diagnostic criteria after age 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and group 2 had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic features of the groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ocular manifestations in group 1 were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients (53.8%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and 12 patients (46.2%) had no ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was higher in group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (18 eyes) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> and 2 patients (4 eyes) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> was higher in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> was higher in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As compared to potentially devastating <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> is more often encountered in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, with respect to ocular involvement, the prognosis is better </plain></SENT>
