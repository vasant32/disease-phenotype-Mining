<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients who fulfilled the International Study Group Classification Criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and 49 healthy control subjects were enrolled to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional electrophysiological studies of peripheral nerves including F latencies were performed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one male and 32 female <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with a mean age of 33.6+/-11.1 years and (22 male and 27 female healthy control subjects with a mean age of 35.8+/-9.9 years were included to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but four of the patients were active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the BD group, electrophysiologically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was detected in nine (14.28%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One (1.58%) patient had sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo>, one patient (1.58%) had sural and ulnar <z:hpo ids='HP_0007141'>sensorimotor neuropathy</z:hpo>, three (4.75%) patients had median and one patient (1.58%) had ulnar <z:hpo ids='HP_0007141'>sensorimotor neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sural nerve sensorial action potential was unobtainable in two (3.17%) patients and prolonged F latencies were observed in two (3.17%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group only one subject (2.4%) had low sural sensorial conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> was higher in the patients with BD when compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensory nerves were affected more prominently than motor nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients and the electrophysiologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between the clinical parameters of the patients with and without electrophysiologically detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, except the levels of disease duration (8.8+/-5.1 vs 5.28+/-4.3 years, respectively, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients may have subclinical peripheral nerve involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conventional electrophysiologic nerve conduction studies including F responses are recommended in routine examination to diagnose early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients without evident neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
