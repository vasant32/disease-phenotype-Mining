<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant association with HLA-B 51 was confirmed (56.8% compared with 10.0% controls, P less than 0.0001, relative risk (R.R.) = 11.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant increases of HLA-DRw 52 (86.1% compared with 50.9% controls, Pc less than 0.05, R.R. = 6.0) and a new specificity detected by a monoclonal antibody, HU-39 (61.1% compared with 25.5% controls, Pc less than 0.05, R.R. = 4.6) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serologic specificity of HU-39 was DRw 8 + DRw 12, which has never been defined using alloantisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical analyses indicated that the determinant recognized by HU-39 was borne on the HLA-DR molecule, not on the HLA-DQ molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that not only HLA-B locus antigens but also HLA-D region antigens, particularly HLA-DR antigens, play a part in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the usefulness of this monoclonal antibody as tissue typing reagent and the application of monoclonal antibodies to the analysis of disease susceptibility were discussed </plain></SENT>
