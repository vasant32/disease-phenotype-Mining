<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used single-voxel MRS to measure metabolites in regions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing pons, basal ganglia and periventricular white matter (PWM) in 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> BD patients with and without neurological deficits and 29 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had significantly higher N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (Cho)/Cr ratios in the basal ganglia than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Cho/Cr ratio in the PWM was also significantly higher in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRS enabled clear discrimination of patients and controls and also revealed spectral differences between non-neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRS can be used to assess brain involvement in BD even if structural changes are absent </plain></SENT>
