<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed an elevated expression of T cells markers tested in patients in active stage of the disease in relation to IFNγ and NO increase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, we noted that CD4+/CD8+ expression correlated with IFNγ and NO production in active stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we observed a decrease of these mediators in inactive stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results indicate a dependent relation between these parameters and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> associated with the evolutionary stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
