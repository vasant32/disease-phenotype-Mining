<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical records of 37 patients with newly diagnosed BD were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the International Study Group criteria for diagnosis of BD and underwent surgeries after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data at the time when surgeries were performed were collected and surgical modalities, postoperative complications, and postoperative medical treatments were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-three surgeries were performed in 37 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During mean follow-up duration of 78.2 +/- 50.3 months, 14 surgeries (32.6%) were complicated by wound dehiscence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and graft occlusion or failure with the mean lag time of 6.0 +/- 4.6 months from surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of postoperative complications was 7.7% at 3 months, 25.6% at 6 months, 33.3% at 12 months, and 35.9% at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications occurred more frequently after surgeries that were performed in patients with positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (P &lt; 0.001) and after vascular surgeries than after nonvascular surgeries (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, surgeries that were followed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> showed a significantly lower postoperative complication rate compared to those that were followed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> alone and those that were not followed by medical treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that a positive pathergic reaction (P &lt; 0.05, hazard ratio = 1.91) at the time of surgery and surgeries that were not followed by treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01, hazard ratio = 2.11) was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the occurrence of postoperative complications can be reduced when postsurgical immunosuppressive treatment was implemented and that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test can be used as screening methods for occurrence of postoperative complications in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
