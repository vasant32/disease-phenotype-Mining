<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve consecutive BD patients were studied for autoantibodies associated with vascular manifestations of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, HLA frequencies, and possible neurological involvement using neurophysiological methods and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HLA-C*15 and C*16 frequencies were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in the patients compared with a reference population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin G concentrations of antiphosphatidylserine and antiribosomal phosphoprotein antibodies were significantly elevated in BD patients when compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased frequencies of HLA-C alleles in BD patients may stress the role of NK cells in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antiphosphatidylserine autoantibodies may in view of their role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because concentrations of antiphosphatidylserine and antiribosomal phosphoprotein antibodies were increased in BD diagnostic tools of this disease should be extended with humoral parameters associated with vascular manifestations of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
