<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A qualitative and quantitative immunohistological investigation was performed on biopsies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> (BS) and those with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (ROU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with control oral biopsies from patients with other diseases and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of HLA-DR on the cell membrane of keratinocytes was found in 13 out of 15 lesions from patients with BS and ROU, as compared with only one out of 15 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative density of HLA-DR was investigated quantitatively by microdensitometry and this confirmed that DR expression in the epithelial cells of patients with BS and ROU was significantly greater than in diseased and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control oral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prominent mononuclear cell infiltration consisted predominantly of T lymphocytes and mature macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the CD4 and CD8 subsets of T cells failed to show significant differences between BS, ROU and control diseased tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased numbers of Langerhans cells were found in the epithelium by morphometric analysis with the CD1 monoclonal antibody in BS and ROU but an increased number was also found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lichen planus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the immunohistological changes in oral lesions of BS and ROU manifest an enhanced immune response in the epithelium, keratinocytes express HLA-class II antigen and increased number of Langerhans cells as well as in the lamina propria with a prominent infiltration of CD4, CD8 and macrophage-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The characteristic pattern of exacerbations and remissions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> can be interpreted by the hypothesis that an initiating microbial agent may induce a mononuclear cell infiltration, with the release of cytokines, expression of class II antigen in keratinocytes and causing ulceration, followed by down-regulation of immunity by tolerant T cells induced by the class II positive keratinocytes, leading to a remission </plain></SENT>
