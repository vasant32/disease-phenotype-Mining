<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the active disease group was compared with the inactive disease group and the control group, there was a significant increase (85.7% versus 71.3% and 69%) in the mean percentage of T cells for the active disease group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of CD4 cells for the active disease group (36%) was also significantly decreased from the mean value of the inactive disease group (36%) was also significantly decreased from the mean value of the inactive disease group (41%) and the controls (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a concomintant significant increase of CD8 cells of the group with active disease (43%) over the mean value for the group of inactive disease (32%) and controls (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that there were alterations of T cells and T cell subsets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other studies, we found that the T cell number increased with disease activity in our patients; but the significance of single measurement of T cell number increased with disease activity in our patients; but the significance of single measurement of T cell subsets in a course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease must be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
