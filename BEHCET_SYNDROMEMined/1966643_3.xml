<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite that protection from <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> is provided by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), there are controversial results about SOD-like activity of polymorhonuclear cells (PMN) in RA and there are no reports about it in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, a potent inhibitor of phagocytosis, has been used for the treatment of BD, no report about its effect on SOD-like activity of PMN is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenging activity (SSA) of PMN and mononuclear cells (MNC) in both RA and BD, and it examines the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> on SSA of PMN in BD using the electron paramagnetic resonance/spin trapping method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SSA of PMN, but not MNC, was significantly lower in patients with either RA or BD, as compared with that in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SSA of PMN in both RA and BD showed a strong negative correlation with that in healthy controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the decrease of SSA in PMN is not disease specific and it is probably the results of the increased amount of <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> generated by these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
