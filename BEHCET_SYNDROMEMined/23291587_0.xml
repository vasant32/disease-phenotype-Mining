<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To discover new susceptibility loci for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 779,465 SNPs with imputed genotypes in 1,209 Turkish individuals with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 1,278 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified new associations at CCR1, STAT4 and KLRC4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, two SNPs in ERAP1, encoding ERAP1 p.Asp575Asn and p.Arg725Gln alterations, recessively conferred disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were replicated in 1,468 independent Turkish and/or 1,352 Japanese samples (combined meta-analysis P &lt; 2 × 10(-9)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found evidence for interaction between HLA-B*51 and ERAP1 (P = 9 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CCR1 and STAT4 variants were associated with gene expression differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three risk loci shared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> (the MHC class I region, ERAP1 and IL23R and the MHC class I-ERAP1 interaction), as well as two loci shared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IL23R and IL10) implicate shared pathogenic pathways in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spondyloarthritides</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
