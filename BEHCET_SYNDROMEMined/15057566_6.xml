<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate tHcy concentrations in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with BD and 20 age- and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma tHcy concentrations were significantly higher, while <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and eye involvement than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein levels also correlated significantly in a negative manner with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> but positively with tHcy </plain></SENT>
