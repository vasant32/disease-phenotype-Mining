<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI performed during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness in eight patients showed an abnormally high signal on the T2 weighted sequences in the occluded sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI showed minor flow abnormalities suggestive of partial recanalisation of the sinus in two cases at a later clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI can be an alternative, non-invasive, investigation to intravenous cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, MRI performed during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness showed multiple hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were usually less than 5 mm, scattered and confluent, mainly in the white matter, distributed in the hemispheric white matter in nine cases, brainstem in eight, basal ganglia and thalamus in five, and cortex in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI abnormalities were usually associated with appropriate clinical deficits, but were larger and more disseminated than expected </plain></SENT>
