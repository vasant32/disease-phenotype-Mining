<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As members of the national project team for intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, we surveyed the state of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Hokkaido </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results are summarized as follows: 1) The occurrence in Hokkaido of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is higher than the national average in concordance with a high rate of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease itself </plain></SENT>
