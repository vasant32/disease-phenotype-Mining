<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the epidemiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Western Switzerland and to study the characteristics of ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, seen from January 1990 to December 1998 at Hôpital Jules Gonin, La Source Eye Center, and the Division of Immunology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Allergy</z:e>, University of Lausanne, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Japanese diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were used and both complete and incomplete forms were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence, proportion of cases with ocular involvement, and the characteristics of ocular disease were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, a total of 35 Behçet's patients were seen in the three study centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of these patients had ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's ocular disease in the western part of Switzerland, with a referral population of roughly 600000 persons, were 0.65 and 0.46 per 100000 per year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the group was 33.2 years, age at presentation was 25.8 years, and mean follow-up was 5.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent sign was oral aphthous involvement (86%), followed by ocular manifestations (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HLA-B51 antigen was present in 66% of the patients with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>Panuveitis</z:hpo> was present in 20/25 patients (80%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> in 3/25 patients, and posterior involvement in 2/25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (88%) had systemic treatment that always included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>; it was associated with other treatments in 17/22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of treatment was 45.5 +/- 25.1 (SD) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean recurrence-free period in the six patients in whom treatment could be interrupted was 18.0 +/- 8.8 (SD) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Visual function was maintained at the end of the follow-up for the collective and visual outcome was correlated to visual function at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Western Switzerland was comparable to that in other western nonendemic countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, the prognosis was favorable in our collective of patients </plain></SENT>
