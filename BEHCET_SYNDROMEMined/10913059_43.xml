<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Familial aggregation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease has been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed at investigating the sibling recurrence risk ratio (lambda s) for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, which is of value in the estimation of the magnitude of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 170 consecutive unrelated index cases (98 male, 72 female) were interviewed with a detailed questionnaire to ascertain their family trees and the manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in their relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the immediately older sibling, or if an older sibling was not available, the immediately younger sibling, was selected as the second sibling for the evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These siblings were contacted by telephone, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were invited for examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 31 of the 170 index cases had 51 relatives fulfilling the International Study Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 166 second siblings, seven had <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (six male, one female) and 22 siblings (eight male, 14 female) with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sibling recurrence rate-defined as the ratio of the risk of being affected among the siblings of patients and the risk of being affected in the general population- was found to be 4.2%, which gives a lambda s value for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease of between 11.4 and 52.5 in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high lambda s value supports a strong genetic background for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease which will be helpful in designing genetic linkage studies </plain></SENT>
