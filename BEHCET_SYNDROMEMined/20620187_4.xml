<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to investigate the association of IL-17A and IL-17F gene polymorphisms with two autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> entities, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), in a Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 362 BD patients, 385 VKH syndrome patients, and 412 controls were genotyped for IL-17A/rs2275913 and IL-17F/rs763780 using polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result showed that the genotype and allele distribution of the two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly decreased frequency of IL-17F/rs763780 C allele (p = 0.006, p(c) = 0.036) and an increased frequency of TT genotype (p = 0.005, p(c) = 0.030) were observed in VKH patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association of the tested two SNPs with BD, even after adjusting gender ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis failed to find any association of extraocular manifestations of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> entities and the tested two SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C allele and TT genotype of rs763780 in the IL-17F gene appear to be associated with protection and susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tested two IL-17 SNPs are not found to be associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
