<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of BD on male sexual function and psychiatric status, and to examine the relationship between sexual function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of BD for at least one year were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' age, educational level, and duration of disease were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A healthy control group was selected with highly similar characteristics to the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sexual functions of the patient and the control groups were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Functions (IIEF), and their emotional status was evaluated using the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The results of the questionnaires in patient and control groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the clinical findings and questionnaire scores was assessed in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two patients with BD and 42 healthy individuals were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean subscale scores of the IIEF for erectile function were significantly lower in the patient group compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The IIEF score was not related to active skin findings, active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, active <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, eye involvement, or medication for BD, but it was related with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The BDI and IIEF scores were negatively correlated in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BD has a negative impact on men's psychological state and sexual function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We recommend that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> be investigated and treated while assessing patients with BD </plain></SENT>
