<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were taken from 24 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who had active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and 16 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBMC were subjected to analysis of T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The products from PCR were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the influence of activation on T-bet expression, the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated PBMC from each sample were also evaluated for expression of T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly increased T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> accumulation was detected in the samples from patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared with that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 62 kDa band was detectable in patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference was found between patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who had active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls concerning the expression of either T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or its protein after stimulation with PHA for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is associated with an upregulation of T-bet expression, which supports a role for the Th1 subset of T cells in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
