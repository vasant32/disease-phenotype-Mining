<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's Syndrome (BS) is a difficult diagnosis to establish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the use of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) in the investigation of 11 patients with suspected intestinal BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Out of 11 patients, 10 with suspected intestinal BS were found to have small <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> on capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each case was retrospectively assessed for symptoms, signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, other investigations, treatment and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 patients had established diagnoses of BS as defined by the International Study Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Central <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and change in bowel habit were the predominant symptoms, both occurring in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and colonoscopy identified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">duodenitis</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">Barium</z:chebi> studies and CT were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WCE revealed small <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> throughout the ileum in five patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> located either in the proximal and/or distal ileum in five other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had significant symptoms, signs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> leading to a change in treatment to infliximab, and this resulted in resolution of symptoms and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten age- and sex-matched controls investigated for unexplained GI symptoms had no intestinal lesions on capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WCE is useful in the investigation of GI symptoms in BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is particularly helpful in those patients in whom conventional investigations have been <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or fail to account for symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique may guide treatment and provide a better understanding of intestinal pathology in BS </plain></SENT>
