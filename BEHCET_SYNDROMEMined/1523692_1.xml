<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional alterations of PMN have been reported in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, therefore, the cell surface antigens were examined by 2-color flow-cytometry using monoclonal antibodies to clarify whether expressions of the antigens on PMN are abnormal in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> (SS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that expressions of CR3 and cALLa were increased on PB-PMN from patients with BD or RA, but not from those with SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BD, we further determined the phagocytic activity of PMN by a flow-cytometric method using fluorescent particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phagocytic activity was significantly higher in BD patients than in healthy controls, and correlated slightly with the expression of CR3 on PMN in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> seemed to decrease the expression of CR3 and/or cALLa in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above results indicated that PB-PMN in BD and RA, but not SS, are phenotypically activated in vivo, and the activation probably reflects several cytokines and/or other stimuli to PMN produced in the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
