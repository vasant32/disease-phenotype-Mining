<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> noninfectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> on systemic immunosuppressive treatment seen at the Ocular Immunology Service, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Health status was evaluated with the Italian version of the SF-36 questionnaire in 8 dimensions: physical functioning, physical disability, body pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional disability, mental health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of variance was used to test for differences in SF-36 scores between subgroups of interest (age, sex, educational level, location and laterality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, systemic associated diseases, visual acuity, systemic treatment, duration of disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred Caucasian patients (35 female, 65 male) with a median age of 46.31 years (range 10-76) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was bilateral in 88% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> location was anterior (12%), intermediate (10%), posterior (34%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent diagnoses were idiopathic (32%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> (15%), and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores were lower among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients than those of the general Italian population; the most statistically significant differences found in subgroups were older age, female sex, low visual acuity (&lt;20/40), and long-standing duration of the disease (&gt;6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Italian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> reported markedly poorer general health status than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> matched population subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The quality of life of these patients seems to be significantly related to visual acuity and disease duration </plain></SENT>
