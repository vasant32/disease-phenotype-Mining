<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 556 eyes whose fundus could be examined, 38 eyes (6.8%) in 33 patients (11%) had developed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> capillary nonperfusion, branch <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion, or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> or disc neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These eyes were treated by photocoagulation, primarily to forestall <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> and the development of neovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, as well as to decrease the macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> resulting from vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment, which was well tolerated, was successful in closing <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> capillary nonperfusion areas and eliminating <z:mp ids='MP_0008852'>retinal neovascularization</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
