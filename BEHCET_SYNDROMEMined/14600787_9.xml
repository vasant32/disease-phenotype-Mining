<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-1beta and IL-1ra were significantly higher in both active and inactive patients than in control subjects (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of TNF-alpha and sTNFR1 were found to be higher in active patients than in controls (P&lt; 0.01 and P&lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the serum levels of these cytokines and their inhibitors between active and inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in mean C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were found in patients with active vs inactive disease (P&lt; 0.001 and P&lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein values correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate but not with cytokines or their inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that elevated serum TNF-alpha and sTNFR1 seem to be important <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The statistically significant increase in these levels may arise from the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the tissue or organ involved </plain></SENT>
