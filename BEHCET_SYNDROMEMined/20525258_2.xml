<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse the functional changes of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T lymphocytes in both active and inactive disease and the effect of infliximab on Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell expansion, activation and cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 1) cell expansion, 2) expression of TNFRII receptor, 3) perforin and gamma interferon (IFN) content, 4) release of granzyme A (GrA) and 5) phenotype changes, in vitro and in vivo, in Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T lymphocytes by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of lymphocyte cultures from patients with active and inactive BD and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cell expansion, expression of TNFRII, perforin and gamma IFN content and release of granzyme A were significantly higher in active patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro and ex vivo treatment with infliximab resulted in a significant reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters together with changes in the phenotype of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> together these data indicate that infliximab is capable of interfering with Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell function in BD and although cell culture models cannot reliably predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential effects of the drug in vivo, our results present the possibility that this drug may find use in a range of immunological disorders, characterized by dysregulated cell-mediated immunity </plain></SENT>
