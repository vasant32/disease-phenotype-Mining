<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the levels of serum-soluble (s) selectins in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) patients and to evaluate the associations of these molecules to disease activity, clinical findings, and drugs taken for BD, mainly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum sE-, sL-, and sP-selectins levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 28 BD patients and 22 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BD patients were classified according to the disease activity, clinical findings, and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were newly diagnosed and were not taking any therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remainder were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (n = 18) and immunosuppressive drugs (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BD patients, the levels of sL- and sP-selectins were significantly lower than those of healthy controls, but sE-selectin level was similar to that of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients on the therapy had significantly lower levels of sE- and sL-selectins and insignificantly lower level of sP-selectin than the patients not receiving therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BD patients with active disease had significantly higher levels of sE-, sL-, and sP-selectins compared with the patients with inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of selectins between the treated active patients and inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the untreated patients with active disease had significantly higher selectin levels than the inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> selectin levels between the patients with or without vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serum sL-selectin was found to be significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings suggest that the levels of soluble selectin molecules in BD patients seem to be modified by the drugs taken for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> therapy is associated with lower selectin levels </plain></SENT>
