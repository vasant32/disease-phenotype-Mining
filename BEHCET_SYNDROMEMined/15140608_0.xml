<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-latency reflexes (LLR) provide information about the continuity of both ascending and descending neural pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the utility of LLR and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) in demonstrating subclinical neural involvement in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with BD were studied by means of SEP and LLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral median nerve SEPs and LLRs evoked by electrical stimulation of both median nerves were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latency of second component of LLR (LLR2), the duration of LLR2-HR (Hoffmann reflex, spinal reflex component of LLR) interval, peak to peak amplitude of LLR2 and the amplitude ratio of LLR2/HR were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data obtained from patients were compared with those of 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LLR2 latencies and the durations of LLR2-HR interval were significantly prolonged in patients with BD (p=0.001 for both parameters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased duration of LLR2-HR interval was the most frequent abnormality observed in the study (37.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that LLR is a useful technique to demonstrate subclinical neural involvement in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
