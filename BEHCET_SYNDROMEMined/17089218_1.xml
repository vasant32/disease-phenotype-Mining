<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there is no study to investigate possible associations between these lesions and endothelial functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesized that active BD period with oral and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> might have more deteriorating effect on endothelial functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with BD were registered for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each subject was evaluated two times in both active and inactive disease periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subject with at least 30 days of lesion-free period was regarded in the inactive disease period, and the subject with any oral and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> was regarded in the active disease period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the control group, 35 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each subject, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> was evaluated in both active and inactive disease periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) values (3.30 +/- 5.76 vs 14.19 +/- 13.55 vs 1.82 +/- 1.31, P &lt; 0.001) and FMD values (13.89 +/- 5.57 vs 8.53 +/- 4.78 vs 15.83 +/- 5.29, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly different among the BD patients in inactive and active disease periods and among control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FMD values in inactive and active disease periods modestly correlated to hsCRP and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brachial FMD is more prominently impaired in BD patients within the active disease period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BD patients are possibly more vulnerable to cardiovascular manifestations when they are in the active disease period </plain></SENT>
