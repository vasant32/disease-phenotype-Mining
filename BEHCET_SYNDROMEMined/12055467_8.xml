<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of aqueous humor were collected from 11 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> who were undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sampling was done by paracentesis at the beginning of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar samples were collected from 20 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each sample, we used the spectrophotometric method based on the Griess reaction to determine the amount of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>, which is the stable metabolite of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The amount of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> in aqueous humor samples from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease was above the detection limit in 8 of 11 cases; the mean level +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> was 2.13 +/- 0.621 micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels in the control group were below the detection limit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (&lt;0.08 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference between the aqueous humor <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and those in controls (P = 0.00002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous humor nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels are elevated in patients with a history of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
