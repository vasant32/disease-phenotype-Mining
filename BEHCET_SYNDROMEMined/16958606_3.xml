<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate serum paraoxonase (PON1) activity in relation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters in active and inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 46 consecutive BD patients and 25 healthy control subjects were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum PON1 activity in both active and inactive BD was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared to the control group, serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in both active and inactive BD (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were significantly higher in active BD than those in inactive BD and control subjects (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was significant negative correlation between serum PON1 and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels (r=-0.697, p&lt;0.05) and serum PON1 activity was also negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels (r=-0.428, p&lt;0.05) in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PON1 could explain the increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> observed in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, according to our results, we suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> may contribute to decreased serum PON1 activity </plain></SENT>
