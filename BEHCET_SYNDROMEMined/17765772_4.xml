<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This study included 27 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome and 35 sex-and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A complete audiological evaluation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average pure-tone audiograms from both groups showed a statistically significant hearing loss in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (59.26%) showed some degrees of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> (SNHL), with the high-frequency type (4, 8, 10, and 12 kHz) being the most common pattern (93.75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss was the fourth most common manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the patient's age, sex, and the duration of the disease were not related to hearing loss, there was a significant correlation between a negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test and hearing loss in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We should consider audiovestibular involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome as a common finding </plain></SENT>
