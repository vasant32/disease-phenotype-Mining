<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined whether IL-23R polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to this disease in a Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs7517847, rs11209032, rs 1343151 and rs17375018 were genotyped in 338 BD patients and 407 age, sex and ethnically matched healthy controls using a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly increased prevalence of the homozygous rs17375018 GG genotype and G allele was found in BD patients compared with controls (corrected p (p(c))&lt;0.001,odds ratio (OR) 1.86, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.49; p(c)&lt;0.001, OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.98, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the AA genotype and A allele of the SNP rs11209032 were significantly higher in BD patients compared with controls (p(c)=0.024, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.35; p(c)&lt;0.001, OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.82, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the results showed a significantly decreased frequency of the AGCG haplotype in BD patients compared with controls (p(c)=0.0016, OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study, for the first time, identified a strong association of an SNP of IL-23R, rs17375018, with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results also suggested that both rs11209032 AA and rs17375018 GG of IL-23R are predisposing genotypes for BD and that the AGCG haplotype may provide protection against BD </plain></SENT>
