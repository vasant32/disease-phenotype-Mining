<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anti-TNFalpha antibodies have been used for treating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But, more effective and safer drugs need to be developed for improved future therapeutic use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To inhibit the expression of TNFalpha, we used small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (siRNAs) to reduce over expression of TNFalpha in vitro in cell cultures and in an in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>-like (BD) mouse model for amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TNFalpha siRNA was injected intraperitoneally twice with a 1-week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To compare the efficacy of TNFalpha siRNA versus an anti-TNFalpha antibody, Infliximab and Etanercept were administered to symptomatic mice with inflamed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intraperitoneal delivery of TNFalpha siRNA effectively decreased BD symptoms in 18 of 32 cases (56.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scrambled siRNA treatment decreased BD symptoms in 2 of 19 cases (10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was effective in 11 of 27 cases (40.7%) and Etanercept was also effective in 9 of 25 cases (36.0%) at the end of the second week after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha siRNA reduced serum levels of TNFalpha (1.57 +/- 0.43pg/ml), compared to levels in mice not injected (84.02 +/- 24.59pg/ml) (p&lt;0.01) or scramble injected (118.89 +/- 20.08pg/ml) (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After single injection of TNFalpha siRNA, improvement of BD symptoms showed at 9 +/- 7th day on an average, contrary, in Infliximab injected group, improvement was apparent at 15 +/- 4th day after injection (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We show that siRNAs can be employed to inhibit cytokine gene expression in an in vivo disease mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This inhibition may, therefore, be attributed to the improvement of inflammatory symptoms </plain></SENT>
