<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examinations indicated that these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were caused by gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Steroid therapy proved ineffective, so we gave 5mg/kg of infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, since the patient responded poorly to the treatment the infliximab was discontinued and a total gastrectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, a <z:mp ids='MP_0003301'>marginal ulcer</z:mp> developed and infliximab was again administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although this brought about improvement in the conditions of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003301'>marginal ulcer</z:mp>, infusion-related hypersensitivities in the patient caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthralgia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore discontinued the infliximab treatment and began 40 mg of adalimumab every other week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of the new treatment, the patient's <z:mp ids='MP_0003301'>marginal ulcer</z:mp> completely healed and her epigastric pain disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that adalimumab may be as useful as infliximab for treating refractory gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
