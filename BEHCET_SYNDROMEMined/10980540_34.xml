<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> is a Mendelian autosomic recessive disease linked to MEFV, a gene of unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BD in contrast is a polyfactorial disease associated with the major histocompatibility complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and BD have epidemiological similarities, we asked whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> gene was implicated in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We screened for the common MEFV mutations a cohort of 114 chromosomes from definite BD patients [meeting the criteria of the International study group] and probable cases [meeting at least two of these criteria] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We screened in parallel an ethnically matched cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and control chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The M694V, V726A and E148Q mutations tended to be more frequent in definite BD (2.6%, 2.6%, and 5.2%, respectively) than in controls (0%, 0%, and 2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P706 polymorphism was found in 10.5% of the probable BD chromosomes, but in only 1.6% of the controls (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because some MEFV mutations were more frequent in BD than in controls, we suggest that they may act as additional susceptibility factors in BD </plain></SENT>
