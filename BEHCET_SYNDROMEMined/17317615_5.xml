<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of CD3+CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) T cells in pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Ten BD patients (age 12.2+/-2.2 years, 7 in remission, 3 in exacerbation state) treated at the Pediatric Rheumatology unit of Soroka University Medical Center and 3 age-matched controls participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes of study subjects were isolated and stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-labeled anti-CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8 antibodies and analyzed by FACS assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proportion of CD4-CD8- DN T cells was significantly increased in BD patients (n=10) as compared to healthy controls (6.2+/-3.4% vs. 3.2+/-1.1% of total CD3+ cells, p&lt;0.05), this cell group was additionally enhanced in BD exacerbation, compared to patients in remission (10+/-4.1% vs. 4.7+/-1.2%, p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DN T cells were significantly increased in BD patients in remission, compared to healthy controls (4.7+1.2% vs. 3.2+1.1% of total CD3+ cells, p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is characterized by increased proportion of CD3+CD4-CD8- double negative T cells in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies, that include additional immunophenotyping and analysis of gene expression, aimed at characterization of these cells are currently underway </plain></SENT>
