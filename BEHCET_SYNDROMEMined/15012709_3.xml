<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of urinary total <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels (end product of NO) in BD and evaluated whether urinary concentrations were correlated with its plasma levels or disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six consecutive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients (19 men, 17 women; 35.9 years), and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control volunteers (12 men, eight women; 33.2 years) were divided into an active (n = 16) and inactive (n = 20) period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urinary and serum NO levels ( micromol/mg urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) were higher in BD patients (4.1 +/- 0.3) than control subjects (1.7 +/- 0.2; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum NO levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and control subjects were 51.3 +/- 9.8 and 21.7 +/- 7.3 micromol/L, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Active patients had higher urinary NO excretion (4.9 +/- 0.3) than inactive patients (3.3 +/- 0.3; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher urinary NO levels found in BD may be produced by the kidney as a result of an inflammatory stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As excess NO is toxic to the tissues, increased NO levels may play a role in mediating subclinic glomerular injury of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, we could not determine the exact site(s) of NO synthesis by the kidney, such as the glomeruli, blood vessels and/or the tubular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whatever the source, urinary NO levels may be used as a new activity marker in the diagnosis and follow up of BD by serial measurements </plain></SENT>
