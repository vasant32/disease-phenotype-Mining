<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite its nature as a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, renal involvement is known to occur infrequently in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>microhematuria</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> in 24-h urine and evaluate subclinical or symptomatic renal involvement in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and eleven patients who fulfilled the International <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease criteria were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After urine analysis, five of 12 patients who were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> underwent renal biopsy, while 199 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> were investigated for <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (MA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 34 (16.1%) patients were found to have renal involvement including 22 (11.1%) with MA and 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsies resulted as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004747'>focal glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> in three, membranous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000096'>glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> in one and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological involvement was found to be significantly more prevalent in patients with MA (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological involvement and duration of disease (&gt; or = 10 years) was found to increase the risk for MA by 21.75-fold and 5.03-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though age over 40 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, HLA B51 haplotype and ophthalmological involvement were not found to be significantly associated with MA; these parameters increased the risk for MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Renal involvement may be more prevalent in BD than it has been recognized; it usually presents with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>microhematuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>; therefore clinicians must check 24-h urine for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>microhematuria</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>; especially in patients who are aged over 40 years, have a longer duration of the disease and multisystem involvement </plain></SENT>
