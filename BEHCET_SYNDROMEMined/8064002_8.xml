<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of cytokines, including interleukin 8 (IL-8), have been shown to activate PMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of IL-8 in the development of BD lesions, IL-8 production in vivo and in vitro was examined in 25 BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-8 levels measured by ELISA in the non stimulated culture supernatants of peripheral mononuclear cells (MNCs) were higher in patients with active BD than in those with inactive BD or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Without LPS stimulation, IL-8 mRNA expression in incubated MNCs detected by Northern blot analysis was higher in active BD patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polarization assay confirmed the accelerated activity of PMN isolated from patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these PMNs did not respond to IL-8 as strongly as to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi> (an exogenous stimulator); a possible reason is that the PMNs of these patients are constantly exposed to IL-8 in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, MNCs, endothelial cells and fibroblasts in BD lesions were positively stained by anti-IL-8 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the production of IL-8 may be accelerated in inactive BD and that IL-8 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
