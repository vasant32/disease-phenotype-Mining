<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, various parameters of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems were investigated in 39 patients with BD and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven of these patients with BD had histories of thrombotic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three were found to have decreased protein S activity, and one patient had diminished protein C activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of those patients had experienced a thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance was present in two patients, one of whom had had a thromboembolic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated FVII (FVIIa), fibrinogen, and cholesterol levels were significantly higher in patients with BD than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patient group, plasma FVIIa level was inversely correlated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma global fibrinolytic capacity (GFC) did not differ between the patients and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found in the GFC and FVIIa levels between patients with and without histories of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the coagulation system was activated in vivo in patients with BD, there was no reactive activation in the fibrinolytic system to counteract the activated coagulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a relative hypofibrinolytic state in BD </plain></SENT>
