<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the clinical features, imaging characteristics and CSF findings of a series of 50 patients seen at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery over the past 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this series, vascular complications had a low prevalence, whereas involvement of the brainstem was common; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100561'>spinal cord lesions</z:hpo>, hemisphere lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> also occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>Optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, vestibulocochlear and peripheral nerve involvement occurred, but were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for recovery was in general good, and the majority of those followed-up over a median of 3 years (range 1-19 years) had only single attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-third of patients underwent further attacks, and four underwent progressive deterioration leading to disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors suggesting a poor prognosis are repeated attacks, incomplete recovery, progressive disease course and a high level of CSF leucocytosis during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data should be of help in the further definition of the clinical characteristics of this rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> and in the planning of treatment trials </plain></SENT>
