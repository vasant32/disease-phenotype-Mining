<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated long-term clinical outcomes and predictors of clinical relapse in patients with intestinal BD receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with intestinal BD, who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> therapy in a single tertiary academic medical center between March 1986 and January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probabilities of clinical relapse after remission were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of clinical relapse were identified by univariate analysis using the log-rank test and by multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 143 patients enrolled, 46 (32.2%) had a clinical relapse while they were being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative relapse rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after remission were 8.1%, 22.6%, 31.2%, and 46.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, a younger age (&lt;35 y) at the time of diagnosis, higher C-reactive protein level (≥1.5 mg/dL), and a higher disease activity index for intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> score (≥60) at the time of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> initiation were independent predictors of relapse in patients with intestinal BD receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> therapy has a positive effect in maintaining remission in patients with intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a younger age (&lt;35 y), higher C-reactive protein level (≥1.5 mg/dL), and a higher disease activity index for intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> score (≥60) were associated with a poor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi> therapy, making careful observation and intensive treatment necessary in these risk groups </plain></SENT>
