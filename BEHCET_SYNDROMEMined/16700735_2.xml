<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously found that gammadelta T cells are increased in peripheral blood of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of gammadelta T cells in oral biopsies from BD patients with special emphasis on the restriction of Vgamma and Vdelta usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of Vgamma and Vdelta chains on peripheral blood gammadelta T cells from 31 BD patients and 19 healthy controls was analysed by flow cytometry and the expression of Vgamma and Vdelta chains in nine ulcerated and eight non-ulcerated oral mucosa from BD patients and non-ulcerated oral mucosa from three healthy controls was analysed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vgamma9 and Vdelta2 were the predominant chains expressed in peripheral blood of BD patients, although other Vgamma and Vdelta chains were also expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of gammadelta T cells was only observed in the ulcerated oral mucosa but not in the non-ulcerated mucosa from the BD patients, and not in the non-ulcerated mucosa from the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These gammadelta T cells showed no preferential expression of any of the Vgamma or Vdelta chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest a polyclonal rather than oligoclonal activation of the gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that during repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the oral mucosa, the gammadelta T cells are responding to a wide variety of antigenic stimuli with consequent expansion of gammadelta T cells expressing various Vgamma and Vdelta chains and that different antigenic stimuli or responses may be responsible for the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
