<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus there is a clear need for nonclinical diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nonspecific cutaneous hyperreactivity response, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>, may serve as an important diagnostic indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> may also clarify the role of an immune complex mechanism in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our study of 11 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, deposition of immunoglobulins or complement was not found 4 hours after <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> or saline injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 24 hours after <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> or saline injection, 10 of 11 patients responded positively both clinically and histologically during the active stage of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> was noted in only two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus in most patients no evidence of an immune complex mechanism was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that any nonspecific intracutaneous injection is a good clinical tool for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
