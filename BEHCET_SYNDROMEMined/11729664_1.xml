<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pure-tone audiometry, Bekesy audiometry, speech audiogram and auditory brain stem response revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings of magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography ruled out a central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorder </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although pulse-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy effectively arrested the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> progression of hearing loss, repeated audiograms showed that a modest dosage of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> failed to maintain such improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after performing high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) therapy, a significant improvement in the hearing loss (more than 10 dB) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, CY is thus considered to be a potentially important treatment for sensorioneural hearing loss </plain></SENT>
