<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed abnormal findings in seven of eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI studies demonstrated extensive regions with high intensity signal in the brain stem and/or basal ganglia on T2-weighted images obtained during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of the disease in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these patients had a strongly gadolinum-enhanced round lesion in the lower pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four of the other five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease, brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was observed on T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atrophic changes were more severe in the brain stem than in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal BAEPs were observed in three patients and consisted of prolongation of interpeak latency of waves III-V and defects of wave III or V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal BAEPs were recorded in patients with severe inflammatory changes or progression of atrophic changes in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that MRI and BAEPs are useful in detecting the presence and assessing the degree of neurological involvement in patients with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
