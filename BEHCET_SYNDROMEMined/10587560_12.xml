<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), being a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of unknown aetiology, is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In addition to 124 patients [male:female (M/F): 73/51], <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of the International Study Group for BD (1991), 14 patients with systemic necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (M/F: 7/7), 47 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (M/F: 36/11) and 51 healthy controls (M/F: 22/29) were also included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serological markers of four different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (anti-HAV IgM, total anti-HAV, HBsAg, anti-HBs, total anti-HBc, anti-HBc IgM, anti-HCV and anti-HEV) were studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups with respect to HAV, HCV and HEV serologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-HBs positivity was observed less frequently in BD compared with healthy controls and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serological evidence of previous HAV, HCV and HEV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was not significantly different between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, previous HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was found in a significantly lower number of BD patients as compared with healthy controls and systemic vasculitic patients </plain></SENT>
