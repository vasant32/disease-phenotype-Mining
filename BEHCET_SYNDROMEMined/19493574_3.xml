<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have indicated that VEGF-A (VEGF) may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of VEGF in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with neurological involvement, VEGF was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 32 patients compared to a group of 12 patients with noninflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (NIND) and 14 patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also studied the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-VEGF (VEGF-A) in CSF and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean VEGF(CSF) was significantly increased in neuro-BD and MS patients compared to NIND patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an association between neuro-BD-VEGF(CSF), and leukocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was also observed between neuro-BD-VEGF(CSF) and CSF(%CD4) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a measure of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier Q(albumin) was found correlated to VEGF(CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was significantly increased in neuro-BD patients compared to NIND patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, VEGF may be associated with the increased percentages of CD4 cell subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of VEGF is within the inflammatory cascade in the mediation of blood-brain barrier disruption and not specific to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's </plain></SENT>
