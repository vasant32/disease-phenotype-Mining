<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not yet been clarified if the HLA-B51 gene itself is the susceptibility gene related to this disease or if it is some other non-HLA gene in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we screened one of the HSP70 genes, HUM70t (HSP70-Hom), around the class III region and the microsatellite sequence located between the HLA-B and TNF genes for genetic polymorphism in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison between patients with BD and healthy controls revealed no significant difference in the frequency of the HUM70t polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the microsatellite sequence, Tau-a, in the region between the HLA-B and TNF genes, the frequency of 14 repetitions of GT was increased significantly and that of 11 repetitions was decreased significantly in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the allelic distributions of the B51 antigen-associated microsatellite polymorphism differed significantly between patients and healthy controls, and in the B51 antigen-negative subjects, analysis of the microsatellite polymorphism also revealed a significant difference in the haplotype frequency between the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the HLA-B51 gene may not be the primary locus responsible for BD, and implicate some other gene(s) located between the TNF and HLA-B genes </plain></SENT>
