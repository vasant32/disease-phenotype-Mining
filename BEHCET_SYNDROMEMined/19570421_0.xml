<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five among 6 cases presented it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cervical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> exhibited the following features: the isolated well-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> with different size and different deep distributed on the uterine cervix, and the top of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was covered by yellow discharge which was not easy to erase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptom and cervical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was calculated to be 2.1 to 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Risk factors for cervical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>: operation of drawing intrauterine devices (IUD) in 2 cases, artifical abortion in 2 cases, cervical biopsy in 1 cases, and no factors in the other one case was identified </plain></SENT>
