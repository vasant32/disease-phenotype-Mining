<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have conducted a segregation analysis in order to characterise the transmission of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et Disease (BD), a multifactorial condition with a strong genetic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete information about BD status and pedigree was obtained on 104 probands from our database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the criteria of the International Study Group for BD (ISBD) to delineate the clinical status of the sibs: possible BD (patients meeting two criteria), or ascertained BD (patients meeting at least three criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A proband was defined as "paediatric" when he/she completed ISBD criteria before/by the age of 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Families were distinguished as paediatric (n = 67) (ascertained through a paediatric proband), and non-paediatric (n = 37) ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate the Mendelian segregation ratio P in nuclear families (two parents and their offspring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum likelihood estimate: Pcirc; = 0.248, calculated in the paediatric data set, was consistent with the theoretical value of P = (1/4) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo>, whereas the Pcirc; value was 0.08 when using the non-paediatric data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our work provides the first evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in BD, and of the existence of a Mendelian entity in the paediatric BD subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous studies failed to show any simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> in BD, probably because they were performed on the whole BD population </plain></SENT>
