<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty primarily treated BD patients (BD group) were treated with TG 30 mg/d orally for 3 months, and a control group consisting of 30 healthy persons was set up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-2, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were detected by radio-immunosorbent assay (RIA) before and after treatment respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And the outcomes were analyzed in combining with the clinical status of patients as well as related indices as erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma in the BD group were evidently higher (P &lt; 0.05) than those in the control group, they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lowered significantly after 3-month TG treatment, from 10.72 +/- 1.84 microg/L, 6.64 +/- 1.05 microg/L and 8.93 +/- 1.23 microg/L to 5.71 +/- 1.04 microg/L, 4.27 +/- 0.76 microg/L and 3.44 +/- 0.72 microg/L, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), while level of IL-2 in the BD group was insignificantly different before treatment to that in the control (though showed an increasing trend) and was unchanged after treatment (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TG treatment showed the effectiveness of markedly effective in 10, effective in 16 and ineffective in 4 BD patients, with the total effective rate of 86.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides, ESR and CRP levels were evidently decreased in BD patients after treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TG may treat BD by way of regulating the levels of IL-1beta,TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
