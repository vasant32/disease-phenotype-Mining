<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients had a total of 80 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, which were analysed for joint distribution and symmetry, in 56 of which the duration could also be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Attacks were oligoarticular, affecting up to 4 joints per patient, 54 (68%) being monoarticular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knees, ankles, and wrists were the most commonly involved joints </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ESR was moderately elevated during the attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 32 specimens the synovial fluid was inflammatory (cell count 14.7 +/- 10.1 x 10(9)/l), but in 19 (59%) a good mucin clot formed </plain></SENT>
