<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to examine the changes in the SDTCs of motor and sensory fibers of the median nerve in patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, which affects axoplasmic flow and may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The SDTCs of motor and sensory fibers of 29 patients who had been taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> were measured following stimulation of the right median nerve at the wrist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with ten healthy age-matched subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lack of any effect on the SDTC by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> might have been due to the fact that <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> affects the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> ATP pump or that it affects internodal channels other than nodal channels </plain></SENT>
