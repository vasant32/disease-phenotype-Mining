<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various diagnostic criteria have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity and the relative value of the Mason &amp; Barnes, Japanese, Hamza, O'Duffy, Cheng &amp; Zhang, Dilşen and International Study Group (ISG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred twenty-eight patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease diagnosed according to either O'Duffy's or ISG criteria and 89 control patients with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, and granulomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e>, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ISG and Hamza criteria showed the highest specificity (100%) in discriminating control subjects from the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest sensitivity value (100%) was found in the Cheng &amp; Zang criteria, which were found to be the most sensitive but the least specific (74.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Hamza criteria had the highest relative value (sensitivity plus specificity) (198.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dilşen (196.9) and ISG (196.5) criteria also had high relative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, Hamza, Dilşen, and ISG criteria performed quite well in diagnosing BD in our country compared to the other criteria sets </plain></SENT>
