<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated three sequence-specific priming (SSP) assays and one real-time PCR assay for detecting HLA-B*51 alleles using 93 whole blood samples, which were genotyped by high-resolution sequence-based typing (SBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HLA-B*51 alleles determined by SBT were detected by the four evaluated assays, and the results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HLA-B alleles other than HLA-B*51 were negative on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HLA-B51 tests showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting HLA-B*51 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three SSP assays and the real-time PCR test for HLA-B*51 genotyping are simple, but reliable for detecting HLA-B*51 alleles in clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
