<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Interventional case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten eyes of 10 patients with CME from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease made up the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eyes had persistent CME despite medical treatment for at least 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravitreal injection of 4 mg (0.1 ml) of triamcinolone acetonide was offered to treat macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The visual and anatomic responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 1-month follow-up, a reduction in mean foveal thickness of 37.4%, from 416 microm to 260.5 microm, was attained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3-month follow-up, mean foveal thickness was 286.2 microm and at 6 months, 263.7 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No eyes had lost vision at 1 month, and eight eyes (80%) showed improvement in visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3-month and 6-month follow-up, three eyes (30%) remained stable and the other eyes had maintained the improved acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide is a promising therapeutic method for CME from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
