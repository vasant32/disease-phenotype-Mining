<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate potential associations between the PlA1/A2 polymorphism of the platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> receptor IIIA (GpIIIa) gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and other clinical manifestations in Italian patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred consecutive Italian patients satisfying the International Study Group criteria for BD who were followed up for seven years and 241 healthy Italian age- and gender-matched blood donors were molecularly genotyped for the PlA1/A2 polymorphism of the platelet GpIIIa gene; 118 and 117 of the 200 BD patients were also respectively genotyped for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique was used to type serological HLA class B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were grouped on the basis of the presence or absence of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> were initially made clinically, and then confirmed by means of ultrasonography or contrast venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the PlA1/A2 genotype was investigated, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequency of the PlA1/A2 polymorphism were not significantly different in the BD patients and controls, but the PlA2 allele was significantly more frequent in the BD patients with DVT than the controls (p=0.023; Pcorr=0.046; OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no associations between thrombotic events and the PlA1/A2 polymorphism in the BD patients carrying factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene G20210A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PlA2 allele was significantly less frequent in the BD patients with genital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> than in those without (26.9% vs. 43.2%; p=0.022; P corr 0.044; OR 0.48, CI 0.27-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PlA1/A2 polymorphism of the GpIIIa gene was associated with DVT in our Italian BD patients, but does not seem to increase the risk of DVT due to factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene G20210A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a negative association between the A2 allele and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
