<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular involvement may be seen in 25% of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> make the prognosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine the structural and functional changes and relations of these changes with progression and prognosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 40 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 40 healthy volunteer control subjects were analyzed, additionally patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were divided into 2 subgroups as those with vascular complications and those without vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intima-media thickness and arterial distensibility were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with carotid artery ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery distensibility was significantly lower in the patient group compared to the control group (0.67 +/- 0.2, 0.93 +/- 0.4, p &lt; 0.05), and carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly higher (0.59 +/- 12, 0.80 +/- 0.11, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> has been detected (0.77 +/- 11, 0.86 +/- 11, p &lt; 0.05) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with vascular involvement compared to patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease without vascular involvement, arterial distensibility in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was similar with those who has no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (0.69 +/- 0.25, 0.63 +/- 0.25, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative linear regression between arterial distensibility and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (B = -1 x 10(-2), p &lt; 0.05), and a significant positive linear regression has also been found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and SBP and diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) and pulse pressure (PP) (B = 6.8 x 10(-3) for SBP, p &lt; 0.05, B = 6.9 x 10(-3) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, p &lt; 0.05, B = 6 x 10(-3) for PP, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> increases and AD decreases in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared to results in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although more studies are required for this subject, use of noninvasive parameters such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and AD, which reflect the structural and functional characteristics of vasculature, may be useful to define disease progression and subjects at high risk </plain></SENT>
