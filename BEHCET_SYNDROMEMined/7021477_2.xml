<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> showed a predominantly neutrophil infiltrate and leukocytoclasia in the vessel walls, as well as extravasates of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In later stages, also histiocytes and lymphocytes appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By direct immunofluorescence technique, 30 of 34 patients showed perivascular precipitates of C3 and Clq, eight patients in addition, IgM and IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, band-like fine granular precipitates of C3 were present in the basement membrane zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By immunoelectronmicroscopy, C3 was demonstrated in fine subendothelial granules of the vessel walls and of the epithelial basement membrane below the lamina densa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no fundamental differences between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate, that an immunecomplex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
