<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has been known to recognize several microbial antigens including that of streptococci, and TLR2 gene Arg753Gln polymorphism has been reported to be strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> with an odds ratio of 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the TLR2 gene Arg753Gln polymorphism in a group of patients with BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> (RHD) and to analyze the role of genotyping errors resulting from duplicated gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 211 patients with BD, 95 patients with RHD, and 94 matched Turkish healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the duplicated exon 3 in 23-kb upstream of the TLR2 gene, genotyping for the Arg753Gln polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was carried out using a new set of primers and PstI restriction enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TLR2 gene Gln753 allele was observed in two of 211 (1.0%) patients with BD, five of 95 (5.3%) patients with RHD, and two of 94 (2.1%) healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and controls were found to be heterozygous for Arg753Gln polymorphism, except one patient with BD, who was homozygous for Gln753 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although a slight increase of heterozygosity was noted in patients with RHD, no statistically significant difference was observed in the distribution of Arg753Gln polymorphism in BD and RHD compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TLR2 gene Arg753Gln polymorphism is not associated with BD nor with RHD; and a duplicated region of the TLR2 exon 3 located 23-kb upstream of the polymorphic region may explain contradictory association findings described so far </plain></SENT>
