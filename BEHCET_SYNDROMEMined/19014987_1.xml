<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of BD is still uncertain, but genetic and environmental factors likely both play an important role in BD development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether polymorphisms of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), previously reported to recognize BD candidate antigens, are associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred Japanese patients with BD and 128 Japanese healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR2 gene and assessed the allele/genotype diversity between cases and controls for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the frequency of TLR2 alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes in the BD cases were detected compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that TLR2 polymorphisms do not play an important role in the development of BD </plain></SENT>
