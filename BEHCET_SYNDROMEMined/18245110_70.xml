<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The multidisciplinary expert committee, a task force of the EULAR Standing Committee for Clinical Affairs (ESCCA), consisted of nine rheumatologists (one who was also a clinical epidemiologist and one also a Rehabilitation Medicine doctor), three ophthalmologists, one internist, one dermatologist and one neurologist, representing six European countries plus Tunisia and Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A patient representative was also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Problem areas and related keywords for systematic literature research were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systematic literature research was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library databases from 1966 through to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 initial statements were generated based on the systematic literature research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These yielded the final recommendations developed from two blind Delphi rounds of voting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine recommendations were developed for the management of different aspects of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strength of each recommendation was determined by the level of evidence and the experts' opinions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of agreement for each recommendation was determined using a visual analogue scale for the whole committee and for each individual aspect by the subgroups, who consider themselves experts in that field of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was excellent concordance between the level of agreement of the whole group and the "experts in the field" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recommendations related to the eye, skin-mucosa disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> are mainly evidence based, but recommendations on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, neurological and gastrointestinal involvement are based largely on expert opinion and uncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The need for further properly designed controlled clinical trials is apparent </plain></SENT>
