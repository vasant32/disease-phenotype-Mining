<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) (Lp(a)) as an indicator of disease activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to investigate its role in thrombotic complications of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 30 patients (19 male, 11 female) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (8 active, 22 inactive) were enrolled in the study group and 30 healthy individuals (16 male, 14 female) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven of the inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients had a history of thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease activity was evaluated by clinical manifestations (oral aphthous lesions, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>) and laboratory investigations (leucocyte count, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a), C-reactive protein (CRP), complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4) concentrations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma Lp(a) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactant concentrations were significantly higher in the study group than in the controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These concentrations were also higher during the active period of the disease than during the inactive phase (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) concentrations were significantly correlated with concentrations of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the groups with and without thrombotic complications for any of these measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of Lp(a) might be an indicator of disease activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no correlation between Lp(a) levels and thrombotic sequela in inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are needed on the thrombogenic role of Lp(a) during the active phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, and in larger series </plain></SENT>
