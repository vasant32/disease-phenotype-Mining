<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its typical features are recurrent oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although vascular lesions are not listed among the criteria for diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, up to 25-35% of the patients develop complications in arterial and venous large vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXEGESIS: We describe the case of a 45-year-old French man with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet-type vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though only one sign of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulcerations</z:e>, was present, the patient had to undergo emergency surgery three times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative treatment combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three years later no therapy failure was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of 1) recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2) large arterial and venous occlusive lesions, 3) superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp>, and 4) ulcerations of the aorta in macro- and microscopic examination of resected aortic walls, we concluded that the patient's life threatening vasculopathy was of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's type, even if several of the diagnostic features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variations in clinical features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are observed that might be due to hereditary traits, particularly to the genetic expression of an incomplete phenotype that would lead to the lack of typical clinical features </plain></SENT>
