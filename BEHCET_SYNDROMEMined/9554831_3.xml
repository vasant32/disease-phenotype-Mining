<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of control neutrophils with serum prominently enhanced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, and serum from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients had a significantly greater effect than that from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that serum from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease contains the priming factor(s) that can enhance enhanced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production by neutrophils in response to stimulation </plain></SENT>
