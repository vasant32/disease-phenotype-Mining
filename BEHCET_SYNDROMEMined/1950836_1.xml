<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 66 patients and 99 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A lymphocyte cytotoxicity test was used for typing HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-DP antigens were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of HLA-B15 was observed in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant difference was observed in HLA-Bw52 which possesses only two different amino acids from HLA-B15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, frequencies of HLA-A11, HLA-Aw33, HLA-B35, HLA-B44 and HLA-DQw1 were significantly lower in the patients than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in HLA-DP antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease involves both disease susceptibility factors and disease resistance factors and that such genetic factors are mapped within or very close to the HLA-B gene in the class I gene region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally class II HLA-DQ antigen is associated with disease resistance factors </plain></SENT>
