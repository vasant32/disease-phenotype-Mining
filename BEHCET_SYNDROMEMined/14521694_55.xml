<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is much higher in countries along the ancient Silk Route, extending from Japan to Mediterranean countries including Turkey, than in northern Europe and the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three previous epidemiologic surveys have been carried out in different regions of Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study investigated the cross-sectional prevalence of BD in individuals aged &gt; 12 years in Istanbul, Turkey, in two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first stage aimed to identify individuals with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (ROUs) by visiting them in their homes, and the second stage aimed to further examine those with ROUs for the presence of other BD-related manifestations under hospital conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sample size was determined to be 24,000 with an expected BD prevalence rate of 1/1000 and a sampling error of 4/10,000, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 6-14/10,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of individuals to be screened in each district was determined in proportion to the population of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> districts in Istanbul </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The standard questionnaire was applied to a total of 23,986 individuals at their homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A history of ROU was recorded in 2289 individuals (9.5%), and a previous diagnosis of BD was recorded in 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of ROU was confirmed in 700, and the diagnosis of BD was established in 101 according to the International Study Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate of BD was estimated as 42/10,000 (95% CI, 34-51/10,000) in Istanbul, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This survey conducted in Istanbul, the largest cosmopolitan city in Turkey with immigrants from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the country, has a larger sample size than other previous studies, and therefore the reported prevalence rate of BD has a more acceptable confidence interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in the estimation of the prevalence of BD in Turkey, and supports previous findings that Turkey has the highest prevalence rate of the disease in the world </plain></SENT>
