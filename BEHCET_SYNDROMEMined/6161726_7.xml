<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to test indirectly the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is caused by a virus, lymphocytes from eighty-six patients were evaluated for two parameters consistent with persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e>: chromosomal abnormalities and decreased ability to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type I (HSV) to grow in lymphocyte cultures stimulated by PHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas HSV grew in lymphocytes cultured from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, replication was impaired in lymphocytes from 37% of the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This figure is increased to 57% if patients receiving steroids or cytotoxic drugs were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes were scored as chromosomally abnormal from sixteen of the thirty-eight patients examined, compared with only one of seventeen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was damage to specific chromosomes in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency with which chromosomal abnormalities were detected was significantly related to failure to replicate HSV and inversely related to concomitant steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings are consistent with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> aetiology for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome but other explanations are not excluded </plain></SENT>
