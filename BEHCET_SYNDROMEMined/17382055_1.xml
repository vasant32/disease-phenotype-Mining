<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vascular involvement is seen as venous occlusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation in this disease, and the surgical treatment of a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has technical difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we suggest that the huge popliteal artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome can be treated by ligation of the popliteal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic because of an infrapopliteal great mass at the left leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler ultrasonography and arteriography revealed a 71 x 54 mm aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> at the distal popliteal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery did not reveal any suitable arterial formation for bypass to the distal area of the popliteal artery and tibial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we applied ligation of aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> at the distal popliteal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient tolerated the operation well and had no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of arteries such as the popliteal artery, which has critical importance for maintaining distal perfusion, ligation may be a treatment method if there are no other alternatives </plain></SENT>
