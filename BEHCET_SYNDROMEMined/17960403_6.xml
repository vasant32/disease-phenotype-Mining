<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and pathogenesis of BD has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since IL-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e>, we aimed to investigate the possible relation of the periodontal scores and SNPs of IL-1alpha-889C/T, IL-1beta-511C/T, and IL-1beta+3962T/C with BD compared to healthy controls (HC) and recurrent aphtous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 155 Turkish individuals were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The periodontal status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was evaluated according to the WHO community periodontal index of treatment needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For genotyping, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>-PCR-SSP was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-1alpha-889C allele was significantly higher in BD patients (p = 0.03) and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (p = 0.02) compared to HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IL-1beta+3962T allele was significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients compared to HC (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male gender (p = 0.04), age (p = 0.02) and carrying IL-1beta-511T allele (p = 0.01) were found to be a significant risk factors for higher periodontal scores in Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We can speculate that susceptibility to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> could be influenced by IL-1 SNPs </plain></SENT>
