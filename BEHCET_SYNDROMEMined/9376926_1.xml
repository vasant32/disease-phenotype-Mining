<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients which had a maintenance treatment with immunosuppressors received 30 intravenous i.v. bolus of corticoids for uncontrolled severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> 58% of cases) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papillitis</z:e> (100% of cases) (1 bolus treatment = 0.5-2 g of i.v. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> once a day, for 3 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, oral immunosuppression was moderately increased in order to prevent further recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tolerance was good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity (VA) remained stable or improved after one month in 87% of cases following the bolus treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 92%, the VA remained stable or improved for a mean follow-up of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These good results suggest that intravenous bolus of steroids is a safe and efficient therapy which may prevent further decrease of the visual acuity and may reduce the side effects of the immunosuppressive treatment needed to control severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
