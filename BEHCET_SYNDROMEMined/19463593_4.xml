<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few reports have been published on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, clinical data and surgical outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> attributable to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> attributable to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were surgically treated between March 1986 and June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 15 men and 4 women with ages ranging from 24 to 55 years (mean, 39 +/- 7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up duration from index operations was 77.4 +/- 68.1 months (range, 9 to 271 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall mortality was 47.3% (9 of 19 patients), but no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred at index operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred after second operations, and the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were low cardiac output (n = 6) and sudden aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein concentrations were negatively correlated with event-free period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival at 13 years was 39.2% +/- 14.1% in patients who underwent aortic root replacement, but this was 4% +/- 3.9% in patients who underwent valve replacement (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival at 13 years in patients who were administered immunosuppressive therapies was 33.7% +/- 11.0% and 0% in patients not administered immunosuppressive therapy (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mortality in this condition was very high and was found to depend on levels of postoperative inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Aortic root replacement and postoperative immunosuppressive therapy may be helpful </plain></SENT>
