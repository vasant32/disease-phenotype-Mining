<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the frequency and phenotypic and functional characteristics of S-antigen (S-Ag) specific T cells in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood was taken from 23 active BD patients, 12 inactive BD patients, and 14 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of the patients were summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T cell response against 40 mixed S-Ag <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was identified by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD69 and CD45RO were used to characterize the phenotype of S-Ag specific T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional property of S-Ag specific T cells was investigated by measuring the production of cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response to the mixed S-Ag <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was found in 56.5% and 25% of active and inactive BD patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The responsiveness to S-Ag <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was unrelated to the clinical features of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>About 65.8% of IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) T cells in active BD patients expressed CD69 and CD45RO concomitantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>S-Ag <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> significantly induced a production of IFN-gamma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha but not interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-17 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in active BD patients with a response to S-Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: S-Ag specific T cells are present in certain active BD patients, and most of them are activated memory CD4(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of BD via producing Th1-dominant cytokines </plain></SENT>
