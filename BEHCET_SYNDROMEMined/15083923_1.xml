<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients and 27 healthy controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urine albumin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and beta2-microglobulin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratios were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and abnormal urinary beta2-microglobulin excretion was higher among patients with BD than in control group, but this was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>Microalbuminuria</z:mp> and abnormal beta2-microglobulin excretion are markers of renal injury, which have not been investigated in BD previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Renal injury in BD is more frequent than has been recognized and it is most often in mild nature </plain></SENT>
