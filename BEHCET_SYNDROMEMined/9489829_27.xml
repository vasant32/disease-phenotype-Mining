<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-12 (Th1 cell response), and IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 (Th2 cell response) cytokine production from anti-CD3/anti-CD40 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PBMC from patients with BD produced higher levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 (Th2 cell response), almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of IL-2 (Th1 cell response), but highly deficient IFN-gamma and IL-12 (Th1 cell response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The additions of exogenous recombinant IFN-gamma to the anti-CD3 stimulated PBMC dramatically changed this pattern with enhanced IL-12 and concomitantly decreased IL-4 and IL-10 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The immune system in BD may be characterized by a divergent cytokine production profile of mixed Th1/Th2 (Th0) cell type; IFN-gamma is critical in modulating the IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 cytokine network pathway in this disease </plain></SENT>
