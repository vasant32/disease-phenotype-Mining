<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to perform a cross-cultural adaptation of the BDCAF to Brazilian Portuguese language and to evaluate its reliability in a population of Brazilian patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brazilian Portuguese version of the BDCAF, named BR-BDCAF, was obtained according to established guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty Brazilian patients with BD diagnosed according to the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease criteria were assessed by two rheumatologists in independent sessions and submitted to the BR-BDCAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intraobserver agreement were then evaluated by kappa scores (values higher than 0.6 indicated good agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good inter- and intraobserver agreements were achieved for the most common manifestations of BD: kappa scores higher than 0.6 were obtained for oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, and articular and general complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderate interobserver agreement was obtained for ocular activity (kappa 0.483) and fair interobserver agreement was obtained for gastrointestinal (kappa 0.322), major vessel (kappa 0.281), and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity (kappa 0.304) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BR-BDCAF was found to be a reliable instrument for the classic mucocutaneous and articular manifestations of BD and for general complaints, but complementary assessment is needed to evaluate specific visceral involvement for disease activity </plain></SENT>
