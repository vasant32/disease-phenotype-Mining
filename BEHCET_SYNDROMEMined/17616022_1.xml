<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (NPSLE) shows some similarities to neuroBe√ßhet disease (NBD) in that both conditions have some analogous clinical features and they are both pathologically associated cerebral vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the clinical manifestations, brain MRI findings and prognosis of NPSLE and NBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty three patients with NPSLE (n = 25) or NBD (n = 18), who were monitored at a single center, were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and brain MRI data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropsychiatric manifestations were classified in both groups according to the new American College of Rheumatology nomenclature for NPSLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diffuse symptoms that included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorders</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> or cluster <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were more commonly observed in the NPSLE patients, while the frequency of focal diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathy</z:e> tended to be higher in the NBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain MRI revealed that the NBD patients had more abnormalities in the brain stem than did the NPSLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients improved, at least partially, after being treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> and/or immune suppressants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the disease course differed significantly between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were more episodic cases in the NPSLE group of patients, while there were more remittent cases in the NBD group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NPSLE had a tendency to cause diffuse neuropsychiatric manifestations, and it has a different predilection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> compared with NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The NBD patients showed a poorer outcome than did the NPSLE patients, suggesting that different therapeutic strategies for the two diseases need to be considered </plain></SENT>
