<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to examine the relationship between the osteopontin molecule and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study registered 60 patients with BD, as well as 50 healthy individuals and 63 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD in our study were divided into 2 groups, with regard to mucocutaneous involvement, as active and inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with BD were also divided into 3 groups with regard to vascular involvement: active, inactive, and no vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma osteopontin (OPN) levels in active patients with BD, inactive patients with BD and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> were found statistically significantly elevated, in comparison to those in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.008, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When active and inactive patients with BD were compared to the healthy control group with regard to vascular involvement, mean plasma OPN levels were found to be statistically significantly higher (p = 0.01, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that plasma levels of OPN were higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
