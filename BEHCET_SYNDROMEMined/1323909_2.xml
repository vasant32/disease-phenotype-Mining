<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 59-year-old Japanese woman, died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002584'>intestinal bleeding</z:hpo> after a 34-year clinical course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She also suffered from recurrent oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like cutaneous lesions and genital ulcerated lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autopsy revealed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the aorta and multiple deep ulcerations in the terminal ileum with no significant vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> and globular hyaline inclusions in the neurons of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system were noted, although there were no clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> throughout the clinical course </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100315'>Lewy bodies</z:hpo> in the 6th decade without any accompanying symptoms is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case seems to draw attention to the presence of these neuronal inclusions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
