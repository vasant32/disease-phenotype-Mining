<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated T cell responses to 8 synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from the mycobacterial 65 kDa and homologous human 60 kDa <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: T cell proliferative responses to synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were studied in 49 patients with BD and 46 disease (DC) and 34 healthy controls (HC) with 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive T cell responses to one or more of the mycobacterial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were observed in 52% (12/23) of patients with BD compared with 17% (3/18) of DC (p = 0.02) and to homologous human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in 57% (13/23) of BD and 11% (2/18) of DC (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses to the mixtures of 4 mycobacterial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were also significantly higher in BD compared with controls (stimulation index in BD 4.7 +/- 3.5 vs DC 2.0 +/- 1.2, HC 1.6 +/- 0.4; BD vs DC and HC, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar elevated responses to the mixture of 4 human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was also observed in patients with BD (BD 3.4 +/- 2.3; DC 1.9 +/- 0.8; HC 1.4 +/- 0.6; BD vs DC, p &lt; 0.01; BD vs HC, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cellular immunity against the 65 kDa mycobacterial and 60 kDa human <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> is significantly increased in Turkish patients with BD compared to controls, as observed in the UK and Japan </plain></SENT>
