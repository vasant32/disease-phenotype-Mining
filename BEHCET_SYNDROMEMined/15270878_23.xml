<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> with unknown pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As various functions of neutrophils in peripheral blood, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase in BD, ROS-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> related to neutrophil activation may have an important role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the importance of neutrophil activation as the main source of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> through protein oxidation in the pathogenesis of BD, and also to investigate whether one of the products of protein oxidation, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), may be used as an activity marker for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BD (n = 49), at active and inactive stages, with or without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and healthy volunteers (n = 40) were entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A full blood count, peripheral blood smears, routine biochemical analyses, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) measurements were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients preceding the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, representing neutrophil activation, and biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> reflecting protein oxidation, such as levels of AOPP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>, were measured spectrophotometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney U-tests, Student's t-tests, anova/post-anova tests and correlation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the results of full blood count, peripheral blood smears and routine biochemical analyses were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, but mean values of CRP and ESR were higher than laboratory reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma MPO activity and AOPP levels were found to be higher and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> values lower in the total patient group and individual subgroups than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with active BD had significantly higher MPO and AOPP levels and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> levels than patients with inactive BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>-positive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>-negative subgroups in MPO and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> levels, but AOPP levels were lower in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with active BD +/- <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were shown to have increased MPO and AOPP but decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> levels in comparison with the inactive BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>-negative subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were strong positive correlations between ESR and CRP, ESR and MPO, ESR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>, ESR and AOPP, CRP and MPO, CRP and AOPP, MPO and AOPP, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> and AOPP levels in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on this first study, in which MPO-mediated AOPP formation has been demonstrated, it may be suggested that activated neutrophils may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD and that chlorinated oxidants of neutrophil origin may lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, notably protein oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AOPP may be a useful marker for monitoring the progress and the severity of the disease activity </plain></SENT>
