<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG, IgM and IgA aCL isotypes were investigated by ELISA in 128 patients with BD, 143 healthy controls and 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IgA binding index (BI) was slightly elevated in BD compared with healthy controls (120+/-53 vs 107+/-46, P=0.02), whereas IgG and IgM aCL levels were not significantly different (IgG, BD 2.5+/-2.4 G <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (GPL), healthy controls 2.8+/-3.6 GPL, P=0.6; IgM, BD 0.7+/-0.9 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (MPL), healthy controls 0.9+/-1.3 MPL, P=0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of aCL positivity was 7% in BD (IgG 0.8%, IgM 1.6%, IgA 4.6%), 50% in SLE and 5.6% in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgA BI was elevated in the HLA-B5-negative group compared with HLA-B5-positive patients (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a literature review, the frequency of aCL was found to be 9.5% in studies from Turkey compared with 25.5% in other series (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results do not suggest a primary role for aCL in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly lower frequency of aCL in Turkish BD patients than in other series indicate that regional determinants, whether environmental or genetic, might also play a role in controlling aCL production in BD </plain></SENT>
