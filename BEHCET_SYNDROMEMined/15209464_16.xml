<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate whether there are alterations in the humoral immune system in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and without any other manifestations of the disease were included in Group I-a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same patients were reassessed during the convalescence period and assigned to Group I-c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (Group II) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgM, complement (C) 3, C4, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in Groups I-a, I-c, and II were measured and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgA, C3, C4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha levels were higher in Group I-a than in Groups I-c and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IgA-, C3-, <z:chebi fb="66" ids="29434">C4-</z:chebi>, IL6-, IL8-, and TNF-alpha-mediated mechanisms might be responsible for ocular lesions in BD </plain></SENT>
