<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the prognostic indicators of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease complicated with arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart analysis of 25 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and angiographically proven arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Occlusive lesions were present in 7 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 3, and both occlusive and aneurysmal lesions in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were not effective in isolated occlusive lesions and probably contributed to one fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven vascular surgical procedures were performed in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial lesions recurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who did not received postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within a 2 yr period after operation, the rate of therapy failure was lower in the group of patients treated with a postoperative combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive drugs, compared to the group treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients treated for lower limb arterial lesions, the rate of relapse was similar whether venous autologous or prosthetic grafts were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in 3/7 patients given <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and in 3/4 patients with no antiaggregant or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> have a worse prognosis than occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> should not be systematically prescribed for isolated occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgery, when feasible, is indicated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> because they entail a high risk of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> are necessary to prevent arterial relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive therapy is more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After bypass for lower limb arterial lesions, anticoagulation is warranted to prevent graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
