<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease posterior segment involvement is very frequent (about 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is the most commonly observed complication and is related to reduction of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to evaluate choroidal involvement during posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty eyes (15 patients) presenting with posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been evaluated with optical coherence tomography (Stratus OCT, Zeiss) to evaluate the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness (RT) and with standardized 8-MHz A scan echography to determine the retinochoroidal thickness (RCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echographic evaluation with 10- and 20-MHz probes was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 7 eyes (23.3%), both RT and RCT were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 eyes (16.6%), they were both increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other 18 eyes (60%), the RCT was increased while the RT was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, thus indicating a thickening of the choroid alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between choroidal thickness and the presence of vitreal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither increases in RT nor those in RCT were significantly related to visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between RT or RCT and pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Choroidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> could often play a primary etiological role during posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Echographic detection of choroidal thickening in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease not presenting with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> alterations or visual symptoms could represent a useful way to detect an early <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, in order to start a proper therapy and to influence the final visual prognosis </plain></SENT>
