<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall 21.3% of the patients had antibodies to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and 18% to Ro (SSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When subdividing the patients according to primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> versus secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, the autoantibodies were detected more frequently in the second group [anti-RNP 13.3 vs. 31.4%, anti-Ro (SSA) 11.8 vs. 27.7%, anti-Sm 10.3 vs. 24% and poly (G) 2.9 vs. 14.8%, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences could be asserted in autoantibody frequencies according to disease location within the uvea </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of autoantibodies among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> appears not to have a major diagnostic value, their assessment may aid to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
