<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An open trial was designed to investigate the efficacy of low dose weekly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) therapy for progressive NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, whose neuropsychiatric manifestations were judged to be progressive (4 females and 2 males, aged 55.0+/-8.2 years), were given oral MTX (7.5-12.5 mg/week) until the end of the 12-month trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical responses of the patients to MTX were judged by neuropsychiatric findings, intelligence test, brain MRI scans and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the 12-month trial, CSF IL-6 levels were found to be significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the neuropsychological manifestations as well as the findings on MRI scans and intelligence quotients were not significantly worsened after the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, which returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by decreasing the dose of MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 6 months after discontinuation of MTX, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the six patients showed significant exacerbation of the manifestations as evidenced by a decrease in verbal intelligence quotients along with the marked elevation of CSF IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that low dose weekly MTX therapy might have a beneficial effect in the treatment of progressive NB, although a trial for a longer period would be necessary </plain></SENT>
