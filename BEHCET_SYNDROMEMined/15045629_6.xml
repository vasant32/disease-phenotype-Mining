<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The local renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) in the vessel wall plays a prominent role in the endothelial control of vascular tonus and contributes to inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is the regulatory component of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the distribution of different alleles of the ACE gene in patients with BD, and the influence of the I/D polymorphism on different clinical manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 90 patients with BD were evaluated for their ACE genotype (male/female: 49/41, mean age: 36.9+/-10.6 years, min/max: 16-66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of symptoms was 9.5+/-6.9 years (min/max: 1-35 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The control population was composed of 30 healthy subjects (male/female: 15/15, mean age: 31.2+/-7.1 years, min/max: 20-45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of DD, ID and II genotypes of the ACE gene was 22 (24.5%), 56 (62.2%) and 12 (13.3%) for patients with BD, and 9 (30%), 16 (53.3%) and 5 (16.7%) for healthy controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no significant association between the ACE gene polymorphism and ocular, neurologic or vascular involvement of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ACE gene polymorphism does not seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, possession of either the D or the I allele does not have an impact on the development of ocular, neurologic or vascular manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
