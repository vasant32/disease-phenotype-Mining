<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of both soluble and tissue ICAM1 were increased in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) but the contribution of ICAM1 gene polymorphisms to this disease remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to establish the association of ICAM1 gene K469E polymorphism in exon 6 with susceptibility for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-five Tunisian patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD and 157 healthy blood donor controls from the same geographic area were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction method for the K469E ICAM1 gene polymorphisms in exon 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the distribution of the K469E allele or genotype frequencies between the BD patients and healthy controls in the ICA1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients, significant association was found between the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and the studied polymorphism in the distribution of the K469E allele (P = 0.004; odds ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval = 2.13-3.62) and genotype frequencies (P = 0.0028; chi(2) = 11.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that K469E ICAM1 gene polymorphism was associated with Tunisian BD patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
