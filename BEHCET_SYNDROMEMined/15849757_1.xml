<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is any relationship between vWF:Ag levels and vascular or other organ involvements and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen controls and 17 Behçet's patients were included; 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, 5 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, 3 had <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, 6 had ocular involvement, 5 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and 6 had vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VWF:Ag levels were higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VWF:Ag levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and ocular and vascular involvement were statistically higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between vWF:Ag levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with and without organ involvement were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A linear correlation between serum ferritin levels and vWF:Ag levels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that elevated levels of plasma vWF:Ag are related to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease exacerbation rather than vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
