<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty patients within the active period of the ocular BD with posterior segment involvement, 30 patients within the inactive period of the ocular BD with posterior segment involvement and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma protein C, free protein S, antithrombin III and activated protein C resistance were measured in the studied groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Activated protein C resistance and antithrombin III levels were significantly altered in both active and inactive ocular BD patients when compared with those in the controls (p&lt;0.05), whereas protein C and free protein S levels were not significantly changed within both groups (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference among the active and inactive groups of BD for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the studied blood tests (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Activated protein C resistance together with increased antithrombin III plasma levels are associated with the posterior segment involvement in ocular BD based on the assessment of basic thrombophilic tests </plain></SENT>
