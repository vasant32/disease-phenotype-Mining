<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset that included 436,192 SNPs in 1,409 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> cases and 1,436 controls of European descent and a BD GWAS dataset that contained 310,324 SNPs in 1,215 BD cases and 1,278 controls were used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identify candidate causal SNPs and pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis was applied to the GWAS datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICSNPathway analysis identified 15 candidate causal SNPs and 28 candidate causal pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The top five candidate causal SNPs were rs1063478 (P = 1.45E-10), rs8084 (P = 2.20E-08), rs7192 (P = 5.18E-08), rs20541 (P = 5.30E-06), and rs1130838 (P = 5.65E-06), which with the exception of rs20541 [interleukin (IL)-13] are at human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These candidate causal SNPs and pathways provided ten hypothetical biological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most strongly associated pathway concerned HLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When HLA loci were excluded, ICSNPathway analysis provided one hypothetical biological mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>rs20541 (non_synonymous_coding) → IL-13 → dendritic cell involvement in the regulation of Th1 and Th2 development, and the GATA3 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ICSNPathway analysis identified four candidate causal SNPs, eleven candidate causal pathways, and three hypothetical biological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of them was as follows: rs2072895 (non_synonymous_coding &amp; splice-site) and rs2735059 (non_synonymous_coding) → HLA-F → <z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>type I diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, antigen processing and presentation, and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The application of ICSNPathway analysis to GWAS dataset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> and BD resulted in the identification of candidate causal SNPs and candidate pathways that might contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
