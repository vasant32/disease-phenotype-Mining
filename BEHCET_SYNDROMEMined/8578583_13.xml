<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When compared to controls, plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, Cp, Cu levels and also plasma MPO activity were significantly higher in patients, whereas plasma TF, SH and Se levels, and also plasma GSH-Px activity were lower in BD patients than those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were significant and positive correlations between <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Cp, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Cu, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MPO, MPO-Cp, GSH-Px-Se, Cp-Cu, and TF-SH parameters, but negative correlations between MPO-TF and Cp-TF parameters in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, it is concluded that plasma <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense system is insufficient and impaired in BD </plain></SENT>
