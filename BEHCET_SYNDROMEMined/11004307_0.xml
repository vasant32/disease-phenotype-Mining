<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To clarify the nature of infiltrating T cells into the anterior chamber of a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aqueous humor was obtained from a patient with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease by paracentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolated from the cells in aqueous humor was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complementary DNA encoding the variable (V) diversity (D) joining (J) (junctional) region of T-cell receptor beta chain V domain (TCR BV) chain was amplified by T-cell receptor BV family polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction Southern blot analysis showed that T-cell receptor BV3, BV5, and BV7 were dominantly expressed on ocular T cells of this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, DNA sequencing revealed that monoclonal or oligoclonal T-cell accumulation was found in T-cell receptor BV3(+), BV5(+), and BV7(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that some T cells infiltrating into the anterior chamber of a patient with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease expand by antigen-driven stimulation, indicating the pivotal role of T cells in the pathogenesis of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
