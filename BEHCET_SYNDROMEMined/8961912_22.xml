<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because exposure to streptococcal antigens might be a major disease activity-provoking factor in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> in the prophylaxis of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> episodes during the course of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, randomized study design was used to allocate patients to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> for 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The duration, severity, and pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> episodes were found to be similar in the 2 treatment groups, but the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> episodes was significantly reduced, and the duration of episode-free time significantly prolonged, in the <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> group compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">Penicillin</z:chebi> treatment was demonstrated to offer adjunctive benefits in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> episodes which are not obtainable with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding could provide additional evidence for antigen triggering in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
