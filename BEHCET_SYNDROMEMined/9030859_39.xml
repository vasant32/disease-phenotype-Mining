<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that CD45RA+ Vgamma9+ Vdelta2+ gammadelta T cells, which constitute a minor population of gammadelta T cells in healthy individuals, were increased in number in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease irrespective of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This CD45RA+ subset of gammadelta T cells in the active, but not inactive, phase of this disease expressed IL-2Rbeta and HLA-DR, suggesting that they are activated in vivo in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the CD45RA+ gammadelta T cells produced extreme amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor and contained perforin granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that a phenotypically distinct subset of gammadelta T cells, CD45RA+ CD45RO- Vgamma9+ Vdelta2+, may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> which may lead to complexity of pathophysiology in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
