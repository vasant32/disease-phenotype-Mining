<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the humoral and cellular immune response against cow's milk proteins in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to distinguish any behaviour during active or inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 16 patients and from eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were cultured in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin, or chicken egg albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin 4 (IL4) were measured in the culture supernatants by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from 46 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and from 37 healthy subjects were also studied for antibody detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to beta-casein, beta-lactoglobulin, and chicken egg albumin were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High IFNgamma but not IL4 levels were found in the supernatants of lymphocytes from patients with active disease cultured in the presence of cow's milk proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels were comparable with those obtained in cultures stimulated with PHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher level of anti-beta-casein and anti-beta-lactoglobulin IgG and IgA antibodies was found in patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between their occurrence and the age of the patients, the duration of disease, or the presence of gastrointestinal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to chicken albumin were detected at low levels and with a prevalence similar to that of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results indicate that an active immune response occurs in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This response involves an increased frequency of antibodies to cow's milk protein and a strong Th1 polarisation after exposure to these antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of these abnormalities supports a putative role for cow's milk proteins immune response in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
