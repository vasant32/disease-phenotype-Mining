<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) provides protection from <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> we investigated whether the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> scavenging activity (SSA) of PMN, mononuclear cells (MNC) or plasma has a correlation to the amount of <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> generated by PMN in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, a potent inhibitor of phagocytosis, on the SSA of PMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In BD, <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> release by both non-stimulated PMN and those stimulated with opsonized zymosan (OZ), or 4 beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12 beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13 alpha-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>), was enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SSA of PMN, but not MNC and plasma, was significantly lower in BD patients as compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SSA of PMN showed a strong negative correlation with their <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SSA of PMN was lower in the BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates</z:hpo> and C-reactive protein levels than in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment increased the SSA of PMN toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that the SSA in PMN obtained from healthy adults was decreased after stimulation with either OZ or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> could prevent the decrease in the SSA when PMN were stimulated with OZ, but not when stimulated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the enhanced <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> release by PMN in vivo may be responsible for the decreased SSA of PMN in BD and the PMN might be able to release more <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> in tissues </plain></SENT>
