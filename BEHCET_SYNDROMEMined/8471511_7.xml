<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed the IgG isotype, nine the IgM isotype, and two had both IgG and IgM isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis, to determine possible correlations between anticardiolipin antibodies and clinical features, and meta-analysis of the data available, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum and histologically confirmed cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and the presence of circulating anticardiolipin antibodies of the IgM isotype was found (P = 0.017 and 0.018, respectively), whereas the IgG isotype did not correlate with any clinical feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of data on other clinical manifestations showed no correlation, either with the IgG or IgM isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, there was no association of circulating anticardiolipin antibodies with the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> involvement or neurological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anticardiolipin antibodies do not play a major pathogenetic role in Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but they may serve as an additional marker for a risk of the development of cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum </plain></SENT>
