<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) levels were measured in BD-like mice, as well as virus injected and asymptomatic appearance BD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice (BDN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of TLRs of peritoneal macrophages were compared by FACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> in vitro, peritoneal macrophages were isolated and then incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify the mechanism of improvement of BD-like symptoms induced by 1,25(OH)2D3, mice were orally administered 1,25(OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in BD-like mice were 12.4 ± 5.4ng/ml, while they were 17.5 ± 7.2ng/ml in BDN mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of TLR2 in BD-like mice was 32.91 ± 20.88%, while it was 12.73 ± 7.67% in BDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of TLR4 was 26.09 ± 10.20% in BD-like mice and 9.72 ± 5.30% in BDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a 72 h culture of peritoneal macrophages in 10-8 M 1,25(OH)2D3, the frequency of TLR2 was 25.0 ± 2.7%, while it was 37.3 ± 5.8% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of TLR4 was 18.9 ± 5.3% with 1,25(OH)2D3, while it was 30.3 ± 0.1% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 improved the symptoms in six out of 11 BD-like mice and downregulated the frequency of TLR2 and TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 influenced Interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha expression in the sera of BD-like mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> improved BD-like symptoms by down-regulating the expression of TLRs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in in vivo mouse models </plain></SENT>
