<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of BS in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent aphthous ulcerations</z:e> (RAU) and to test the hypothesis that BS could be under diagnosed in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a cross-sectional investigation of the prevalence of BS based on the International Study Group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> (ISGBD) criteria in patients with RAU attended in a stomatology service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and six patients were attended at the ambulatory clinic in the study period, but the standard questionnaire was applied to 50 (16.6%) patients, 29 men and 21 women, identified as having RAU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one patient met the ISGBD criteria presenting RAU of the minor and complex type, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, cutaneous, articular, ocular, and vascular manifestations, hypoacusia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a prevalence of 2% of BS was defined in this subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the frequency of 2% of BS in patients with RAU demonstrates the need for further population-based studies to be developed in order to definitively establish the real prevalence of this condition </plain></SENT>
