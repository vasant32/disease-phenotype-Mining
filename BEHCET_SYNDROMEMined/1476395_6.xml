<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated anticardiolipin antibodies (AC) in a genetically homogeneous group of Italian patients with BD and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset, we examined the level of factor VIII-related antigen and antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a high prevalence of AC; AECA were not found in most of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only three patients had raised levels of factor VIII-related antigen, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had systemic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe BD may be considered as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of unknown origin in which several and different pathogenetic factors may play a role </plain></SENT>
