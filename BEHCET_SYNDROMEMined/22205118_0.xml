<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in large joints, bursas, and large vessels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032533" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="pmr">polymyalgia rheumatica</z:e> (PMR) using 18-FDG <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and to differentiate PMR from similar diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen untreated patients with active PMR and 17 control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (n = 11) or other active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> (n = 6) underwent 18-FDG PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FDG uptake in large joints, bursas and vertebral spinous processes was evaluated by calculating maximum standardised uptake values and by visual scoring (scale 0-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET scan images were scored in seven vascular regions, and total vascular scores (range 0-21) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032533" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="pmr">Polymyalgia rheumatica</z:e> patients showed increased FDG uptake in ischial tuberosities, greater trochanters, and lumbar spinous processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive results at two or more of these sites showed high sensitivity (85.7%) and specificity (88.2%) for the diagnosis of PMR, and shoulder or hip-joint involvement showed low disease specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High FDG accumulations were found in the aortas and subclavian arteries of two PMR patients who were asymptomatic for temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and scanty synovium and perisynovium, based on FDG uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PET/CT images of the 12 PMR patients without apparent vascular involvement showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> and/or perisynovitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT may be useful for the detection of PMR lesions, which are difficult to identify using other methods </plain></SENT>
