<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the development and maintenance of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the role of IL-23 and IL-17 in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-23p19 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined using RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-23, IL-17, and IFN-gamma in sera or PBMCs were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the frequencies of IL-17-producing and IFN-gamma-producing T cells and the expression of CD45RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results showed that the expression of IL-23p19 mRNA, IL-23, IL-17, and IFN-gamma was markedly elevated in BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of IL-17-producing and IFN-gamma-producing T cells from PBMCs were significantly upregulated in BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased IL-17 (3.10% +/- 0.53%) in BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was primarily produced by CD45RO(+) memory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recombinant (r) IL-23 could upregulate IL-17 production by polyclonally stimulated PBMCs, whereas interferon (IFN)-gamma downregulated IL-17 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that the levels of IL-23, IL-17, and IFN-gamma are elevated in BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and they suggest that the IL-23/IL-17 pathway together with IFN-gamma is associated with the active intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
