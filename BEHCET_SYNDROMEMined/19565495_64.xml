<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to describe cases of TB associated with anti-TNF mAb therapy, identify risk factors, and estimate the incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted an incidence study and a case-control analysis to investigate the risk of newly diagnosed TB associated with the use of anti-TNF agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As part of the French Research Axed on Tolerance of Biotherapies (RATIO) registry, for 3 years we collected cases of TB among French patients receiving anti-TNF mAb therapy for any indication; for each case, 2 patients treated with anti-TNF agents served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We collected 69 cases of TB in patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (n = 40), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spondylarthritides</z:e> (n = 18), inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> (n = 1) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (n = 1) with infliximab (n = 36), adalimumab (n = 28), and etanercept (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had received correct chemoprophylactic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sex- and age-adjusted incidence rate of TB was 116.7 per 100,000 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 12.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 9.7-15.5) and was higher for therapy with infliximab and adalimumab than for therapy with etanercept (SIR 18.6 [95% CI 13.4-25.8] and SIR 29.3 [95% CI 20.3-42.4] versus SIR 1.8 [95% CI 0.7-4.3], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case-control analysis, exposure to infliximab or adalimumab versus etanercept was an independent risk factor for TB (odds ratio [OR] 13.3 [95% CI 2.6-69.0] and OR 17.1 [95% CI 3.6-80.6], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors were age, the first year of anti-TNF mAb treatment, and being born in an endemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of TB is higher for patients receiving anti-TNF mAb therapy than for those receiving soluble TNF receptor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increased risk with early anti-TNF treatment and the absence of correct chemoprophylactic treatment favor the reactivation of latent TB </plain></SENT>
