<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although its incidence is high in the Mediterranean countries and in Japan, BD is not often found in German patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore compared the epidemiological and clinical involvement of BD in 39 patients of German and of Mediterranean origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first manifestation was oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> in 72% of patients, followed by eye involvement (62%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (25%), and arthritic problems (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eventually, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients developed oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas Germans had eye involvement in only 55% of cases (Mediterraneans, 71%), they came up with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> more often (64%) as compared with Mediterraneans (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first ocular symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> in 87.5% of patients; the visual prognosis was poor due to occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 22 eyes of 12 patients, 16 had a visual acuity of 0.1 or less after 5 years of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a similar association with human leukocyte antigen B5 (HLA-B5) in the German patients (66.7%) and in the Mediterranean group (54.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significantly higher HLA-B5 association with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate a few differences between the two ethnic groups but illustrate that in Germans the disease also has a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
