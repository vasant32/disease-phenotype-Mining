<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Having similar features, both of these conditions can pose problems in the differential diagnosis of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there has been a recent awareness of coexistence of BS and familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to reassess the performance of ISG criteria among patients with BS and other rheumatological conditions, specifically including those with CD, UC, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 302 consecutive patients with BS and 438 patients with other rheumatological conditions were surveyed for the presence or absence of the features of BS by means of a standard form which had been prepared according to ISG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> control patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test and an eye examination by an experienced ophthalmologist with a slit lamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the ISG criteria were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 302 patients with BS (2%) did not fulfill the ISG criteria while 5 of 438 controls (1%) fulfilled the ISG criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study ISG criteria performed well in correctly classifying BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further specificity studies might be considered in CD </plain></SENT>
