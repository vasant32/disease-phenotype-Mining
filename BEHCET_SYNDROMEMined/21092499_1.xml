<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical features in patients with cardiac valve lesions associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 10 BD patients with cardiac valve lesions who were admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) during June 1999 to June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> occurred in 6% of patients with BD in PUCMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients included 8 male and 2 female with the mean age of 36.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cardiac symptoms with an average length of clinical course of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 patients fulfilled the ISG diagnostic criteria for BD and another 5 patients diagnosed by experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main echocardiography findings were severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatations</z:mpath> of ascendant aorta, echo-free space at the aortic root, <z:mp ids='MP_0006118'>aortic valve prolapse</z:mp>, mesh like mass incorporating aortic cusp, aortic valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 patients underwent 7 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5 simple aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgeries resulted in severe perivalvular leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2 patients underwent Bentall and heart transplant surgeries respectively with perioperative immunosuppressive therapy had no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac valve involvement in BD is a rare but critical problem that requires a timely diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The current diagnostic criteria may have possibilities of delayed diagnosis of such problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography seems to be helpful for the timely diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The immunosuppressive therapy and Bentall type operations may be essential for improving the treatment outcome of BD with cardiac valve lesions </plain></SENT>
