<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results revealed a significant increase in the number of mast cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> content of five reactive lesions showed a two-fold increase compared with that in apparently uninvolved skin of patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that mechanisms similar to cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity may be involved in the production of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's lesions </plain></SENT>
