<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surface EMG was recorded simultaneously from several myoclonic muscles and the correlation between their rhythmic discharges was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possible existence of a remote influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010530'>palatal myoclonus</z:hpo> was tested by recording soleus and anterior tibial H-reflexes and seeking a correlation of their amplitudes with the rhythm of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010530'>palatal myoclonus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cases, both with additional severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> in the legs, showed rhythmic variation of the soleus H-reflex amplitude corresponding with that of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0010530'>palatal myoclonus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the neural mechanism generating the visible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> has much more extensive effects </plain></SENT>
