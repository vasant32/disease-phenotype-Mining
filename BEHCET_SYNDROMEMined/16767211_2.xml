<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a multisystemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because some researchers have recently suggested a primary association of BD with the A6 allele of the human major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>) gene, we investigated microsatellite polymorphisms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> gene in subjects with and without BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a case-control study of 23 Japanese patients with BD and 23 Japanese volunteers without BD who were compared for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> microsatellite polymorphisms using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also analysed associations between 5 MICA alleles and the clinical features of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between case patients and control subjects in phenotype frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6 allele showed the strongest positive correlation with the human leukocyte antigen allele HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allele A5 showed a strong positive correlation with age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and a strong negative correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001094'>iridocyclitis</z:hpo> and HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A4 showed a strong negative correlation with ocular lesions and HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6 allele had significantly higher HLA positivity than patients without the allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: While the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6 allele had no significant association with BD, it showed a strong association with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6 and BD may be a secondary phenomenon related to HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As several associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> alleles and clinical features have been found, further investigation is expected to elucidate the biological mechanism of action of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> protein relative to disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
