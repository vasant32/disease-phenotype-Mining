<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the anterior chamber associated immune deviation, the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> are still not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reason as to why there is a big difference concerning the clinical process between human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and its counterpart, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> induced in animal, is expected to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> and Vogt-Kayanagi-Harada syndrome are the two most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> entities in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, studies should be focused on both diseases to clarify the aforementioned issues, which will greatly contribute to the development of strategy in the treatment and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
