<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and outcome of endovascular therapy combined with immunosuppression for the treatment of arterial pseudoaneurysms due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven pseudoaneurysms (3 in the abdominal aorta, 3 in the subclavian artery, and individual lesions in the brachiocephalic artery, renal artery, common iliac artery, common carotid artery, and the descending thoracic aorta) in 9 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were treated with 10 stent-grafts and 1 self-expanding stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</z:hpo> (ESR) were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Endovascular treatment was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, without major adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ESR was reduced from 42.7+/-18.0 mm/h initially to 18.6+/-12.6 mm/h after immunosuppressive therapy prior to endovascular repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean 24.1+/-14.0 months, range 6-43), 8 of 11 lesions showed complete resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One stent-graft to treat a postsurgical recurrent carotid artery pseudoaneurysm was occluded, and an abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm recurred; both patients stopped their medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ESR during follow-up was 7.9+/-4.5 mm/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment for pseudoaneurysms due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is feasible and effective when disease activity is strictly controlled with immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
