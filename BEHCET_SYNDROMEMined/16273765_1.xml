<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The thrombotic tendency in BS has been studied with inconclusive results perhaps due to the inadequate numbers of patients studied during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as well as the lack of appropriate diseased controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor (PAI-1), and d-dimer levels in BS patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> both in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases along with suitable diseased and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: t-PA and PAI-1 were studied by ELISA and d-dimer by semiquantitative latex agglutination slide test in 30 BS patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), 10 BS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DVT (ADVT), 25 BS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> DVT, 27 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e>, 26 diffuse systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 15 patients with ADVT due to other causes, 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and 23 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The t-PA levels in BS with ADVT were significantly lower than those in patients with ADVT due to other causes (7.4 +/- 6.2 vs. 13.4 +/- 6.3, P = 0.027) while PAI-1 levels did not show significant differences between the groups (P = 0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of patients with d-dimer levels of &gt; or = 0.5 microg/ml in BS with ADVT were similar to those found in patients with ADVT due to other causes (9/10 vs. 14/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The relatively low t-PA levels point to a defect in fibrinolysis in BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>d-dimer levels are increased in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BS </plain></SENT>
