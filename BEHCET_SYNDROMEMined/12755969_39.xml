<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher incidence of severe clinical course and systemic involvement is observed in male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of sex on the clinical course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet' s disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical findings of 2313 Behçet patients followed up at the multidisciplinary <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Center at Ankara University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male/female patient ratio was 1.03 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In male <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients, the prevalence of mucocutaneous lesions and systemic manifestations was as follows: 85.6% genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e>, 45.5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, 59.5% papulopustular lesions, 17.5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, 38.1% ocular involvement, 11.3% articular involvement, 11.7% vascular involvement, 3.3% neurologic involvement, 1.4% gastrointestinal involvement, and 1.8% pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In female <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients, the prevalence of manifestations were as follows: 91% genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e>, 49.8% <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, 48.3% papulopustular lesions, 3.5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, 19.8% ocular involvement, 11.8% articular involvement, 2.1% vascular involvement, 1.3% neurologic involvement, 1.4% gastrointestinal involvement, and 0.03% pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum were more frequent in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand papulopustular eruptions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, ocular, neurologic, pulmonary and vascular involvement were more frequent in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While female patients had the best prognosis, male patients had a worse overall prognosis than females </plain></SENT>
