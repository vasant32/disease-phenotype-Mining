<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The analysis of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) is a cytogenetic technique used to show DNA damage as a result of an exchange of DNA fragments between sister chromatids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that there is an increased SCE frequency in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B51-positive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease exhibit higher SCE frequencies than those without HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lymphocytes from 75 patients (38 women, 37 men) and from 50 controls (28 women, 22 men) were cultured in darkness for 72 h in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metaphase chromosomes were stained with a fluorescence plus Giemsa technique after a standard harvest procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For HLA-B51 typing, DNA was extracted from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42191">ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid</z:chebi> blood samples and HLA-B5 allele genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence specific primer method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 75 patients with BD (52%) and 15 of 50 controls (30%) were found HLA-B51-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SCE frequencies in HLA-B51-positive patients were higher than in HLA-B51-negative ones (P &lt; 0.001), whereas no difference was detected in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a significant association between <z:mp ids='MP_0003701'>elevated SCE</z:mp> frequencies and existence of HLA-B51 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
