<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of polymorphisms of the IL-6 receptor gene (+24013A/G:Ala31Ala; +48892 A/C:Asp358Ala), the IL-8 receptor gene (+2607G/C:Ser/Thr IL-8RA), and TNF-alpha 238 (G/A) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in patients of German or Turkish origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was extracted from blood samples taken from patients in Germany (n=93) and Turkey (n=28), as well as from 51 German and 20 Turkish healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms were analysed by PCR with the LightCycler system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant association was found between TNF-alpha 238, +2607 IL-8RA, +48892 IL-6R or +24013 IL-6R- polymorphisms and nationality or disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistically there was no difference between the patients and controls (TNF-alpha 238: p = 0.86; +2607 IL-8RA: p=0.23; +48892 IL-6R: p=0.087; +24013 IL-6R: p = 0.80) nor between Germans and Turks (TNF-alpha 238: p=0.13; +2607 IL-8RA: p=0.68; +48892 IL-6R: p=0.32; +24013 IL-6R: p=0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The single nucleotide polymorphisms of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptor genes and the TNF-alpha gene analysed here do not appear to be associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
