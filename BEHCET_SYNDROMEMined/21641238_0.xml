<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to report our experience with 23 patients presenting with 32 peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) and their outcome after vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was retrospective in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Except for those presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture, patients underwent surgery after treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> appeared to be pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Graft interposition with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> or saphenous vein was most commonly employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were put on immunosuppressive and antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was done every 6-12 months, complications recorded and managed appropriately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis of a peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 41.0 ± 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 17 (53%) femoral, 8 (25%) popliteal, two carotid, two external iliac, two brachial and one internal iliac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (61%) patients had a single peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> while nine had two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> initially presenting 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients with multiple peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had surgery for their second asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 84 ± 62 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> operated on, 7 (24%) anastomotic pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 11 (38%) graft occlusions developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five (22%) patients underwent major lower extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Six (26%) mortalities were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgery for peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in BD is warranted in many instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Results of operation can be improved by prolonged monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> efforts, peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involvement in BD worsens the prognosis </plain></SENT>
