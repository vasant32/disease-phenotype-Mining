<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of corticotherapy on IL-8, IL-12, and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production during idiopathic and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral venous blood was drawn from 70 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> before and during corticotherapy (32 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and 38 with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>) and from 30 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma was collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated immediately and cultured with or without Concanavaline A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-8 and IL-12 levels in plasma and culture supernatants were measured by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels were evaluated using a modified Griess method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before therapy, the two groups of patients showed highly significant elevation of IL-8, IL-12, and NO levels compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During therapy, IL-8 and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in active idiopathic and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was correlated with therapy duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, while significant reduction of IL-12 levels was observed both in vivo and in vitro in idiopathic active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> during therapy, this effect was observed in vitro in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> but not in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that IL-8, IL-12, and NO are involved in the physiopathological mechanisms of idiopathic and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These three molecules showed different degrees of sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of corticoids, reflecting their different regulation by corticotherapy during active phases of the two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to our study, IL-8 can serve as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, while IL-12 should be used as a marker of the specific immune responses during active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
