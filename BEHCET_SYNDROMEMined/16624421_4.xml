<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency, cytokine profile and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of NKT cells were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 42BD patients and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 9 neuro-BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry revealed a decreased frequency of NKT cells in PBMC from BD patients (median: 0.06%; range: 0%-0.3%) when compared to healthy controls (median: 0.23%; range: 0.1%-0.7%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NKT cells were biased toward a Th(1)-like phenotype, with a significant decrease of IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio in BD (median: 0.049; range: 0.01-0.13) vs. healthy controls (median: 0.82; range: 0.4-1.33; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NKT cells were increased in CSF-BD samples (median: 0.18%; range: 0.1%-0.4%), when compared to CSF-NIND patients (median: 0.05%; range: 0.01%-0.09%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the reactivity of PBMC-derived NKT cells toward alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), 80% of BD patients were non-responsive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the opposite, the reactivity of NKT cells in CSF from BD patients was not impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BD-CSF NKT cells exhibited an increased expression of IFN-gamma-producing cells, demonstrating that CSF-NKT cells were functional, and biased toward a Th(1)-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that functional NKT cells are recruited into BD inflammatory sites contributing to BD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
