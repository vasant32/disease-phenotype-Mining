<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> was diagnosed; one case corresponded to the syndrome described by Hughes and Stovin, that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> especially of the vena cava accompanied by singular or multiple pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in young patients; and the last case could best be described as an association of the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our observations lead us to question the existing notions concerning the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and Hughes-Stovin syndrome-the clinical, angiographic and histologic aspects of the vascular manifestations are comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Typically the two diseases run similar courses with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulting frm the rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These case studies cast certain doubts as to the effectiveness of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment usually prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we suggest that Hughes-Stovin syndrome might be, in fact, a manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
