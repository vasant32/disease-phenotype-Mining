<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of these antibodies was the same in both groups of patients and was significantly greater than the incidence in a control group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulceration</z:e> is primarily due to hypersensitivity to food antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The factors which might contribute to the absorption of antigenic molecules from the mouth and to the increased immune response in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral disease</z:e> have been considered </plain></SENT>
