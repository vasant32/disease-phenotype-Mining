<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted on 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (group I), and on 11 healthy subjects (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies -aCL were determined by the standard ELISA method, where 1GPL= 1 microgram/ml IgG aCL and 1 MPL= 1 microgram/ ml IgM, and were considered negative &lt; 10 GPL or MPL, low positive (10-40 GPL and MPL), or high positive (&gt;40 GPL and MPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group of 11 patients with the diagnosis Sy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>, 6 of them were (54.5%) with values of anticardiolipin antibodies over 10 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control group of the healthy examinees aCl were positive in 2 cases (18.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are no statistically significant differences in the presence of systemic clinic characteristics between aCl positive and negative patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference is statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of anticardiolipin antibodies is increased in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are no statistically significant differences in the presence of systemic clinical characteristics between aCL positive and negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity in patients with SY <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> is statistically significantly much lower in patients who had increased values of aCL </plain></SENT>
