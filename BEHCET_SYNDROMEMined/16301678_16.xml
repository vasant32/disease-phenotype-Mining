<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> generalized exanthematous pustulosis, a peculiar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013182" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug hypersensitivity</z:e> reaction, suggested that CXCL8-producing T cells regulate <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp>, polymorphonuclear neutrophil-rich <z:hpo ids='HP_0011123'>skin inflammations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we test the hypothesis of whether CXCL8-producing T cells are present in autoinflammatory diseases like pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin revealed few CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, few CXCL8+ cells, and no neutrophilic infiltration, whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo>, numerous CD4+ T cells but few CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, or CXCL8+ cells were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a pronounced infiltration of neutrophils and of predominantly CD4+ T cells was observed in skin biopsies from pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> generalized exanthematous pustulosis, with infiltrating T cells strongly positive for CXCL8 and the chemokine receptor CCR6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin-derived T cell clones from pustular skin reactions were positive for CCR6 but negative for CCR8 and secreted high amounts of CXCL8 and GM-CSF, often together with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha after in vitro stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some skin-derived T cell clones from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and from pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> predominantly produced CXCL8 and GM-CSF, but failed to secrete IL-5 and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells might represent a particular subset as they differ from both Th1 as well as Th2 T cells and are associated with a unique, neutrophil-rich <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that CXCL8/GM-CSF-producing T cells may orchestrate neutrophil-rich pathologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> autoinflammatory diseases like pustular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
