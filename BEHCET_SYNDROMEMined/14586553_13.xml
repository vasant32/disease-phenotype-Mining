<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, being a well-known risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, is also a contributing risk factor to venous and arterial thromboses of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with BD and 40 healthy subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In male patients, the frequency of vascular involvement was significantly higher than in females (46.7% vs 13.3%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in patients with BD than healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01), in patients with vascular involvement than those with mucocutaneous involvement (P &lt; 0.01) and healthy controls (P = 0.001), and in male patients than in female patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels between the BD patients with mucocutaneous involvement and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level was independently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (odds ratio 1.29, P &lt; 0.01), but male sex was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that elevated serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels may play some role in the development of venous and arterial thromboses in BD </plain></SENT>
