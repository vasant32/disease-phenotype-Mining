<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated genetic polymorphisms of TNF alpha -308 G/A, TNF beta +252 G/A, and TNFR2 196 R/M in 94 Korean BD patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the role of TNF and TNF receptor polymorphisms in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to identify the TNF-alpha promoter (G = TNFA1, A = TNFA2) and TNF-beta intron polymorphisms (G = TNFB1, A = TNFB2), and polymerase chain reaction-singly-strand conformation polymorphism was used to identify TNFR2 196R/M polymorphism (T = TNFR2M, G = TNFR2R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in the TNF-alpha, TNF-beta or TNFR2 polymorphisms of the patients and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies of TNFA1/A2 were 0.94/0.06 in patients and 0.96/0.04 in healthy controls (p = 0.36, OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.26-1.63), for TNFB1/TNFB2 these were 0.42/0.58 in patients and 0.44/0.56 in controls (p = 0.68, OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.61-1.38), and for TNFR2R/TNFR2M 0.23/0.77 in patients and 0.21/0.79 in controls (p = 0.62, OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.69-1.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study found no differences of TNF alpha -308 G/A, TNF beta +252 G/A or of the TNFR2 196R/M polymorphisms in Korean BD patients versus healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the role of TNF in BD is not genetically determined, but can be functionally explained </plain></SENT>
