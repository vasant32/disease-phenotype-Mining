<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both eyes of patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> involvement due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were consecutively evaluated and were established as having mild or severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> according to the ophthalmoscopic and fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>One eye</z:mp> from each patient was randomly selected and 25 eyes with mild to moderate and 25 eyes with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler imaging (CDI) was used to quantitate blood flow velocities and vascular resistance in the ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>), central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (CRA) and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein (CRV) of these patients and those of 25 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three groups were age- and sex-matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, peak systolic, end diastolic and average flow velocities were significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CRA blood flow velocities of patients with severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> involvement were significantly lower than those with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and control groups and the average vascular resistance was significantly higher than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the average blood flow velocities in the CRV of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were significantly lower than in mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Marked circulatory changes were seen in the ophthalmic vasculature of eyes with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although larger studies are required to define the true sensitivity and specificity of this technique, these initial results suggest that CDI could play a major part in the assessment of patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
