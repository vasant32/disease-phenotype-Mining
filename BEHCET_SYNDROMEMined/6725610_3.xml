<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the percentage of Langerhans' cells found were similar in patients' (1.88%) and the control epidermis (1.79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The density of Langerhans' cells in adjacent sites of the same epidermis was not homogeneous, being in the range of 0.8-2.8% in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 0.6-4% in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the controls, Langerhans' cells were distributed unevenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some were located near the basal layer of the epidermis while the rest were in the mid and upper layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease most Langerhans' cells were in the mid-epidermis, but some were immediately beneath the stratum granulosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease epidermis the area occupied by Langerhans' cells was increased by about 25% and the number of granules found increased by about 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease the Langerhans' cells are in a more active state </plain></SENT>
