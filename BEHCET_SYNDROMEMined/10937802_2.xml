<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The important role of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> is now becoming increasingly clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, conflicting data exist in terms of the contribution of these factors to the thrombotic risk in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case report, we describe a patient with BD who presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001648'>cor pulmonale</z:hpo> due to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and pulmonary artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biochemical evaluation revealed that the patient was homozygotic for the factor V Leiden (R506Q) mutation and had increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His condition deteriorated despite adequate anticoagulation treatment, and he died suddenly after 7 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assume that the presence of thrombophilic risk factors augments and synergizes with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> already existing in BD, leading to fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in this patient </plain></SENT>
