<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in a multiethnic population living in France, with particular focus on disease risk among immigrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted in a county in the Paris metropolitan area that is home to 1,094,412 adults (ages &gt; or =15 years), of whom 26% are of non-European ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD living in this area during 2003 were identified using 3 sources (hospitals, community physicians, and the National Health Insurance database), and diagnoses were verified using the International Study Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized, year-2003 prevalence rates were computed for the overall population and for each ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratified prevalence rates according to age at immigration to France were calculated to investigate the relationship between age at immigration and BD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-nine subjects fulfilled our search criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence per 100,000 adults was 7.1 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.5-14.4), and the prevalence for populations of European, North African, and Asian ancestry was 2.4 (95% CI 0.6-7.2), 34.6 (95% CI 24.4-47.5), and 17.5 (95% CI 10.7-27.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the migrant population of either North African or Asian ancestry, BD prevalences were similar for residents born in France, residents &lt;15 years old at immigration, and residents &gt; or =15 years old at immigration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the prevalence of BD among immigrants of North African or Asian ancestry is significantly higher than that in the European-origin population, and comparable with rates reported from North Africa and Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results suggest that BD risk is not related to age at immigration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that BD has a primarily hereditary basis </plain></SENT>
