<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study presents our cumulative clinical experience from the use of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) in a large series of Greek patients with suspected small bowel (SB) diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Over an 18-month period, 193 patients were evaluated with WCE for suspected SB diseases [108 obscure gastrointestinal (GI) <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002028'>chronic diarrhea</z:hpo>, 22 suspected and 6 diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, 4 refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo>, 3 polyposis syndromes, 1 Rendu-Osler-Weber disease and 1 Behcet disease] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had undergone upper GI endoscopy and total colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WCE findings were characterized as specific or non-specific, depending on whether the patient's signs and symptoms could be sufficiently attributed to them or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One or more abnormal findings were detected in 161/193 (83%) patients; these were classified as specific in 91/193 (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield of WCE (in terms of specific findings) was significantly higher when evaluating patients with obscure GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002028'>chronic diarrhea</z:hpo> (52% vs. 25%, respectively, p=0.013, 95% CI: 1.33-7.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among obscure GI bleeders, specific findings were significantly more in the group of overt rather than occult bleeders (66% vs. 42% respectively, p=0.026, 95% CI: 1.19-5.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients referred for diagnosed or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, WCE findings were compatible with the diagnosis in 5/6 cases (83%) and in 8/22 cases (36%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 9 more patients from other groups with a negative previous diagnostic work-up, WCE helped in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 16 patients evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, specific findings were identified only in 1 (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WCE seems to be a very useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of GI <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> of obscure origin (in both overt and occult bleeders), as well as suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In other indications, such as unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002028'>chronic diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, it completes the traditional work-up, but abnormal findings need to be better delineated before WCE can be widely recommended in these cases </plain></SENT>
