<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>Recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) is a common ulcerative disease of the oral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurrent oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulceration</z:e> is the most common and consistent feature of the more serious and systemic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Association of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) gene polymorphisms with BD have been reported in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate if there is an association between these polymorphisms and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control association study using 91 Caucasoid <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients and 91 ethnically matched systemically healthy controls were genotyped for the -786 and 894 eNOS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chi-square analysis was used to compare the allele and genotype frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of the -786 and +894 polymorphisms or the VNTR polymorphism between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: eNOS gene polymorphisms associated with BD are not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> common to both conditions may have a different underlying genetic aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although our data suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> does not have an association with eNOS, it is still possible that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is involved in the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This could still occur through localised and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> driven regulation by iNOS </plain></SENT>
