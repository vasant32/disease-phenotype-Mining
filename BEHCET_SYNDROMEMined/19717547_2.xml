<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There had been evidence that low-dose local IFN could be beneficial in the management of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (OUs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy and collected initial data on the safety of low-dose natural human IFN-alpha administered by the oral mucosal route in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) in a placebo controlled, double blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four (59 males and 25 females) patients with BS with mainly skin mucosa disease and a history of recurrent OU for &gt; or = 1 year were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When they had at least two OUs with a total diameter of &gt; or = 4 mm, they were randomly allocated to (i) 2000 IFN-alpha IU/day, (ii) 1000 IFN-alpha IU/day and (iii) placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were monitored weekly over an initial 4 weeks and bi-weekly for an additional 8 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OU were counted and measured at each study visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was the difference in the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> burden at Week 0 compared with that at Week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 84 patients enrolled, 72 completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms in terms of the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose natural human IFN-alpha did not have beneficial effects on reducing the total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> burden among BS patients from Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study also showed that counting the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> rather than measuring the size would be adequate in future studies </plain></SENT>
