<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>E-selectin is expressed by activated endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the selectin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules are shed from activated cells, soluble forms of these proteins can be used as activation markers of endothelium (E-selectin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) is closely related to endothelial cells, leucocyte functions and immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate circulating E-selectin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, which are known to play a significant part in the immune response especially by regulating interaction of the leucocytes with endothelium in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma E-selectin concentrations were evaluated in 23 patients with BD and 20 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disease activity was evaluated by clinical manifestations (oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, eye involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>) and by laboratory investigations [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients were newly or previously diagnosed cases not taking any drug for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of E-selectin were measured with commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits using human sE-selectin (cat. no: BMS 205) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma E-selectin concentrations of patients and controls were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was assigned to p values lower than 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serum levels (mean+/-SD) of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) were significantly higher in 23 patients with BD than in 20 healthy controls (53.2+/-18.2 ng/ml vs 33.8+/-7.5 ng/ml, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between sE-selectin levels and CRP and ESR in patients with BD (r=0.78, p&lt;0.001 and r=0.56, p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increases in the E-selectin in BD may be a direct consequence of the leucocyte and endothelium activations observed during the disease process </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This may provide additional information regarding disease activity along with the traditional indices such as ESR and CRP </plain></SENT>
