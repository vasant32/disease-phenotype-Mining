<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotyping for the HLA-A locus was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-Luminex typing method in 223 BD patients and 1,398 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The phenotypic frequencies of HLA-A*02:07 (odds ratio (OR) = 2.03, P = 0.002), A*26:01 (OR = 1.85, P = 0.008), and A*30:04 (OR = 2.51, P = 0.006) tended to be higher in BD patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but the frequency of A*33:03 (OR = 0.59, P = 0.003) tended to be lower in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis adopting our and the Japanese data confirmed the associations of HLA-A*02:07, A*26:01, and A*33:03 with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequencies of the HLA-A*02:07, A*26:01, and A*30:04 were significantly higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (OR = 2.37, P &lt; 0.0005, Pc &lt; 0.012) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (OR = 2.32, P = 0.002, Pc = 0.048), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (OR = 3.01, P &lt; 0.0005, Pc &lt; 0.012), and with vascular lesions (OR = 9.80, P &lt; 0.0005, Pc &lt; 0.012) and a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (OR = 4.10, P = 0.002, Pc = 0.048), respectively, than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In HLA-B*51 non-carriers, these associations were also significant, being much stronger between HLA-A*26:01 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (OR = 4.19, P &lt; 0.0005, Pc &lt; 0.012) and between HLA-A*30:04 and vascular lesions (OR = 13.97, P &lt; 0.00005, Pc &lt; 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA-A*30:04 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in HLA-B*51 non-carriers (OR = 3.89, P = 0.002, Pc = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HLA-A*02:07, A*26:01, and A*30:04 were associated with increased risk for BD, while HLA-A*33:03 with decreased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-A*02:07, A*26:01, and A*30:04 were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and with vascular lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test, respectively </plain></SENT>
