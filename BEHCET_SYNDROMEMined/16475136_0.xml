<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been reports of patients in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease occurred during the first months of their lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe here the case of a 12-year-old female from Pakistan whose first symptoms appeared at the age of 6 months in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first neurological symptoms appeared at the age of 5 years in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and dysmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the head was a valuable aid in the study of the vascular alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She also presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pains</z:hpo>, arthromyalgia, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in the mouth and severely delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Yet, we were finally guided towards a diagnosis by the appearance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> on the genitals, which do not usually occur until puberty, as well as the findings from the skin biopsy study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serological study revealed the presence of antigen B08 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Establishing therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and later with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> brought about the practically complete remission of the clinical picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, which has been infrequent in our country up till now, is a condition to be taken into account, especially in young female patients from countries with a high incidence rate of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, accompanied by neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of this syndrome and performing appropriate complementary studies are essential to be able to reach an early diagnosis and for establishing suitable treatment </plain></SENT>
