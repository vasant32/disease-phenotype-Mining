<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers and PBMC cultured with and without phytohaemagglutinin stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in serum and culture supernatants was measured using a sensitive polymerase chain reaction-based assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An RT activity above the levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was detected in a minority of patients with BS (2/15) and SLE (1/13) and was typically present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of RT activity were not detected in follow-up samples from the two BS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that elevated RT activity is present in only a minority of patients with BS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously elevated activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three sample types implicates PBMC as the source of this retroviral activity </plain></SENT>
