<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) have been reported in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) with an established risk factor for vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the authors demonstrated that elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels are associated with ocular involvement in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> can result from genetic errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a mutation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR C677T) gene influences <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> metabolism and, therefore, MTHFR C677T polymorphism provokes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the possible genetic factor for the elevation of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> level in patients with BD by examining gene interaction with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, a crucial factor of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors aimed to evaluate if there is an association between the C677T polymorphism and the presence of ocular involvement in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 59 patients with BD (25 men, 34 women) with a mean age of 34.9 years and 42 age and sex matched healthy control subjects (19 men, 23 women; mean age 32.2) were included in this investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MTHFR gene polymorphism was investigated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of a genomic DNA fragment at nucleotide 677 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genetic equilibrium is assumed for the gene frequencies of the MTHFR polymorphism in both samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype of the MTHFR gene differed between the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and control subjects (TT: 11.9 v 2.4%; CT: 55.9 v 61.9%; CC: 32.2 v 35.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TT homozygous genotype was more frequently in BD patients than the controls, though the difference was not significant (p = 0.063) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In BD patients with ocular involvement, however, the frequencies of MTHFR TT homogenetic type (27.8%) were significantly and statistically higher than those in BD patients without ocular involvement (4.9%, p = 0.022, odds ratio = 7.5), or the controls (2.4%, p = 0.003, odds ratio = 20.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TT homozygous genotype was associated with an increased risk for ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> seem to be a result of C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene, with increased TT individuals over CC and CT genotype BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although no association was shown between the MTHFR reductase C677T polymorphism and the increased risk of oral aphtahe or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, a mutation in this gene was associated with an increased risk of ocular involvement, suggesting genetic instability with a potential initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> lowering therapy in this patient group </plain></SENT>
