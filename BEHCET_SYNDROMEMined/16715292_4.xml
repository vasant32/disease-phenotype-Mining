<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aim to evaluate total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status (TAS) and total <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (TOS) in BD patients, and compare their results both with controls that had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TAS statistically decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients, and TOS levels increased in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients than those in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of Cu significantly increased only in BD patients when compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fe levels were not statistically different among the BD patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients and healthy controls, but there was a positive correlation between TOS and plasma Fe levels in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that there is an insufficient <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system and increased oxidative status both in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplementations in addition to medical treatments will improve the quality of life </plain></SENT>
