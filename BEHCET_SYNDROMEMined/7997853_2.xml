<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of carbohydrates in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) was studied by double immunofluorescence flow cytometry, using MoAbs CT1 and CT2 but only a small proportion of cells bound these MoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MoAbs CT1, CT2 and the lectin vicia villosa (VV) which share specificity for <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> NAc were then used to examine lymphocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000794'>IgA nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in MoAbs CT1 CT2 and VV binding CD4 or CD8 cells was found only with lymphocytes from patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, MoAbs CT or VV binding lymphocytes from healthy subjects were significantly up-regulated by activation with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PHA), cross-linked anti-CD3 MoAb or a common antigen (65kDa heat shock protein), suggesting that an increased proportion of T cells expressing these carbohydrates results from any of the three types of lymphocyte activating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition studies were then carried out to determine the relationship between the MoAbs CT1 and CT2, VV and GalNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, VV binding to T cells was significantly inhibited by either MoAbs CT1 or CT2, or GalNAc but not GlucNAc, suggesting that VV shares a common binding site with MoAb CT and that GalNAc may constitute one of the sugar receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigations of lymphocytes from adult peripheral blood in health and disease suggest that carbohydrate antigens may play a role in activation and immunoregulation </plain></SENT>
