<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the value of IL-6 as a marker of disease activity, serum and CSF IL-6 levels of 68 BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (26) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive (14) parenchymal involvement (pNB), dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (5) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (13) were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> sclerosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112174" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">panencephalitis</z:e>, and noninflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF but not serum samples of neuro-BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pNB displayed significantly increased IL-6 levels as compared to other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> progressive pNB patients also showed increased CSF IL-6 levels, albeit less prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with increased CSF IL-6 levels were more likely to have increased CSF cell counts and total protein levels and these three parameters were correlated with long-term (3 years) disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive patients, IL-6 was elevated despite otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSF IL-6 seems to be a marker of disease activity and long-term outcome for pNB along with CSF cell count and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF IL-6 could be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive patients who have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF cell, or protein levels to detect disease activity </plain></SENT>
