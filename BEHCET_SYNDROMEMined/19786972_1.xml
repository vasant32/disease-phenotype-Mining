<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report an unusual case of neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (NBD) presenting with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelitis</z:e> that affected the lumbar cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 19-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in both the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He had a 6-year history of recurrent oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum on his legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesion at the L1 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nodular enhancement of the lesion was achieved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from cutaneous lesions were consistent with an active perivasculitic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> (pulsed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> followed by oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) therapy was administered immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the patient's clinical condition improved dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The spinal cord lesion disappeared on the MRI performed 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus far, there has been no recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBD may involve the lumbar spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prompt recognition of this disease and early vigorous steroid therapy are important to prevent further disability and recurrence </plain></SENT>
