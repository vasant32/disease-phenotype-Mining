<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: IFN alpha was used in 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, nine with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and nine with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (mean evolution time 3.8 years) previously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (18), CyA (16) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose was 5 MU/day (4 weeks) and then twice weekly (12 weeks) maintaining the previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluations were made at the start of the study, two weeks and two months and a cross-sectional study in February 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the early phase both vitreal cellularity (p = 0.01) and macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (p = 0.003) improved; at the late phase improvements were noted in vitreal cellularity (p &lt; 0.0001), macular (p &lt; 0.0001) and papillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (p = 0.04) and visual acuity (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In February 1995 (mean evolution time 30 months), ten patients (56%) remain without treatment with inactive disease, six (33%) with CyA and two (11%) with CyA and IFN alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvements in vitreal cellularity (p = 0.0001), macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (p = 0.0001) and visual acuity (p = 0.013) were still present although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macular ischemia</z:e> was more severe than at the beginning (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important adverse reactions (late reactions) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (three cases) and thyroid changes (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IFN alpha is an important therapeutic alternative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy (included CyA) </plain></SENT>
