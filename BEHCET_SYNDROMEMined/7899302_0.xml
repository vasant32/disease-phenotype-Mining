<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Different diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are proposed in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the criteria proposed by Mason and Barnes with those proposed by the International Study Group and with those proposed by the Japanese committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 41 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease according to the criteria set by Mason and Barnes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 16 patients of French origin and 25 patients of North African origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Genital ulcerations</z:e> were more frequent in the North African population (p &lt; 0.007) and typical <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> were more frequent in the French population (p &lt; 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing the clinical data among the 41 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease according to the Mason-Barnes criteria revealed that only 83% met the criteria set by the International Study Group and only 54% the criteria of the Japanese committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the International Study Group criteria, the requirement for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0542250" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">buccal ulcerations</z:e> with at least 3 episodes over a 12 month period (a major criteria) was the most limiting element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> were not always recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the variability of clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proposed diagnostic criteria vary depending on the study committee and should be used as diagnostic guidelines rather than as criteria required for positive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
