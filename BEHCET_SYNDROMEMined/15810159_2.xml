<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in blood rheology, particularly increased erythrocyte aggregation, might play a role in the development of such thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, haematocrit, erythrocite aggregation, erythrocyte deformability, blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and erythrocyte indexes in patients with a nonactive disease at sampling, and in a well-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient group comprised 42 patients with BD (21 male, 21 female aged 43+/-12 years) and the control group comprised 46 healthy volunteers (23 male, 23 female aged 45+/-13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 42 patients with BD had a previous documented history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> at least 6 months before entering the study, and the other 30 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients showed statistically higher fibrinogen concentrations (P=0.001), plasma viscosity (P=0.002), blood viscosity (P=0.006) and erythrocyte aggregation, both at stasis (P=0.001) and at a low shear rate (P=0.002): the other rheological parameters were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in the rheological parameters when patients with and without previous thrombotic episodes were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with BD show a moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperviscosity syndrome</z:e>, possibly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, this does not seem to play a role in the development of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
