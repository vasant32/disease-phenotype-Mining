<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> (BS) is unknown, but a number of streptococcal species have been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hypothesis was postulated that a shared antigen, such as a stress protein, might account for some of these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a rabbit antiserum against a 65-kDa heat shock protein of Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> revealed a corresponding 65-kDa band with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six Streptococcus sanguis strains examined and S. pyogenes but not with S. salivarius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By applying a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kDa heat shock protein, an approximately 65-kDa antigen was identified in the uncommon serotypes of S. sanguis ST3 and H.83 and one with a different Mr was identified in KTH-1 and S. pyogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies Y1.2, C1.1, II H9, and ML30, which reacted with these streptococci, recognize residues 11 to 27, 88 to 123, 107 to 122, and 276 to 297 of the 65-kDa heat shock protein, respectively, suggesting that these residues are conserved among some uncommon serotypes of S. sanguis and S. pyogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analyses of sera from patients with BS for immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibodies revealed bands of 65 to 70 kDa with the mycobacterial heat shock protein, S. sanguis strains, and S. pyogenes, although these reactivities were also found to a lesser extent in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 65- to 70-kDa band was found more frequently with S. sanguis KTH-2 or KTH-3 and IgA in serum from patients with BS than with serum from controls (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies in serum were then studied by a radioimmunoassay, and in patients with BS this revealed significantly raised IgA antibodies to the recombinant 65-kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein and to soluble protein extracts of S. sanguis ST3, KTH-1, KTH-2, and KTH-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas significant anti-65-kDa heat shock protein and anti-S. sanguis ST3 antibodies were also found in sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, the anti-S. sanguis KTH-1, KTH-2, and KTH-3 antibodies were confined to BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the streptococcal antigens are associated with heat shock or stress proteins, which will need to be formally established by isolating heat shock proteins from streptococci </plain></SENT>
