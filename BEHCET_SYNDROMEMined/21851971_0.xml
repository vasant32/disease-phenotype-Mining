<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two haplotypes of the endothelial protein C receptor gene, H1 and H3, are associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of these haplotypes on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated the H1 and H3 haplotypes in 87 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 19 with and 68 without a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and in 260 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also measured protein C, activated protein C, and soluble endothelial protein C receptor levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of the H1 haplotype seemed to protect <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients against <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (odds ratio 0.21; 95% CI 0.1-0.8; p=0.023), whereas the frequency of the H3 haplotype was lower in patients than in control individuals (0.19; 0.1-0.5; p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the H1 haplotype was associated with increased levels of activated protein C, whereas the H3 haplotype was associated with the highest soluble endothelial protein C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, activated protein C levels were lower in patients with than in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the H1 haplotype protects <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, likely via increased levels of activated protein C, whereas individuals carrying the H3 haplotype seem to be protected from the clinical manifestations associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, probably via increased soluble endothelial protein C levels </plain></SENT>
