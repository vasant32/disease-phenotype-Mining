<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among the patients who visited the Rheumatology Division, Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center, Taegu, Korea from March 1997 to February 1998, 35 patients, with more than 3 months follow-up, were compatible for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> according to the Shimizu criteria, after exclusion of uncertain or possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of various manifestations was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regarding the joint manifestations, the involved joint, signs and the pattern of the articular symptoms were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basic laboratory tests, HLA studies and simple radiologic studies were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 35 patients had evident, recurrent, painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> by the study definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>Genital ulcers</z:hpo> were found in 29%, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in 77%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in 9%, gastrointestinal ulcerations in 6% and vascular manifestations in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Joint manifestations appeared in 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knee(91%), proximal interphalangeal (53%) and metacarpophalangeal joints(21%) were the main sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tenderness was prominent in 91% and swelling in 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Polyarticular presentation was found in 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In most cases (76.4%), the articular symptom was short-lasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein was likely to be positive in active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HLA B51 was positive in 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, various manifestations can be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The arthritic manifestation seems quite common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It may present as seronegative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, it may present as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085574" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">palindromic rheumatism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
