<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of dental and periodontal treatments to the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients were in the intervention group (F/M: 15/14, mean age: 39.6 +/- 6.9 years) and 29 (F/M: 15/14, 39.4 +/- 10.6 years) were followed with a conventional treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to oral hygiene education, dental and periodontal treatments were carried out in the intervention group, whereas the control group was only given oral hygiene education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated in the pre-treatment observation period (1 month), treatment period (1 month) and 6 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in the number of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (4.1 +/- 3.5) was observed within 2 days during the treatment compared with 3-30 days during treatment month (2.3 +/- 1.2) (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 6 months after the treatment, the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (1.9 +/- 1.5) was significantly lower compared with the pre-treatment observation (4.8 +/- 3.2) (P = 0.000) and treatment periods (6.4 +/- 2.3) in the intervention group (P = 0.05), whereas a similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> presence was observed in the control group (2.8 +/- 2.4, 3.7 +/- 2.3 and 4.8 +/- 4.3, respectively) (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dental and periodontal indices were also better in the intervention group during the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, in BD patients, dental and periodontal therapies could be associated with a flare-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in the short term, but may decrease their number in longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also lead to a better oral health </plain></SENT>
