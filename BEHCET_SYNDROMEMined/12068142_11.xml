<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PR was tested in 64 BD patients, 74 disease controls, and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venous PR was performed in 8 BD patients with PFVPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up PR was done in 14 patients with positive reaction during inactive phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PR was positive in 35.9% of BD patients, in 1 patient among disease controls, and in none of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>pustule</z:mpath> formation was observed in one BD patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance between positive PR and the clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean clinical activity score of BD patients with positive PR was similar to patients with negative reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Venous PR was positive in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The follow-up PR was positive in 2 patients during inactive phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusively the positive PR appeared to be specific for BD, and was not associated with the clinical variables or disease severity, but was usually found during active phase in cases with positive reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The PFVPS in patients with negative PR might be considered to be positive </plain></SENT>
