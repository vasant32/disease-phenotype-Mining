<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assesses the prevalence of both systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who have no clinical cardiac manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (12 women and 10 men, mean age 34 +/- 2.4 years) underwent full clinical examination, electrocardiography, M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean disease duration was 5 +/- 4.7 years (range, 1 month-16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As age and sex-matched control group of 20 healthy subjects was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, prolonged deceleration time, reversal of the early and late peak transmitral diastolic flow velocities, late peak transmitral diastolic flow velocities (E/A ratio) and increased atrial filling fraction were noted in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that left ventricular dysfunction occurs frequently in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and Doppler echocardiography may be valuable in detecting diastolic filling abnormalities as an early sign of cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
