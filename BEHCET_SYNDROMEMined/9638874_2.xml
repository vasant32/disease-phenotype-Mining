<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to analyze the immunopathologic mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease, the gene (bes-1) encoding a streptococcal antigen correlated with the disease was cloned and sequenced, and protein produced by this clone was identified by Western immunoblotting using serum antibody from the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cellular DNA of Streptococcus (S.) sanguis serotype KTH-1 (uncommon serotype 1, strain 113-20) from the patient was extracted and digested with EcoRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The digested fragments were cloned into the cloning vector lambda gt11, and then the resulting DNA library was immunoscreened using the patient's serum antibody to serotype KTH-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunopositive clone of the 1.5 kbp fragment was subcloned into pUC 118 plasmid (pU8BeS1-1) and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sequence showed that the 3'-terminal half side region of this insert contained 962bp of open-reading frame (ORF) discontinued at the EcoRI restriction site, and the stop codon was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of the remaining additional 3'-terminal region of this gene encoding whole <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi>-1 was determined by genome walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The whole ORF of bes-1 consisted of 849 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 95 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The residues in a portion of the amino acid sequence showed a 60% correspondence to those of the human intraocular <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Brn-3b </plain></SENT>
