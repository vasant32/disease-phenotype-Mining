<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess potential associations between Korean <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and two polymorphisms of the endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS) gene, which include the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 and a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 65 patients with BD, 27 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and 80 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 and VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 of the eNOS gene were made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique and PCR genotyping, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, HLA-B51 typing was performed in the BD group and controls by a two step PCR sequence-specific primers method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences in Glu298Asp genotype frequencies were found between the BD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> groups and the controls (BD group v controls: p(corr)=0.006; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> group v controls: p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Asp298 frequency was much higher in the BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> groups than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even after stratification of the BD group based on the results of HLA-B51 testing, a significant association of the Glu298Asp polymorphism was still found (p=0.002, Mantel-Haenszel weighted odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.7 to 10.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distribution of the genotype frequencies in two eNOS gene polymorphisms was similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and primary vasculitic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, distribution of alleles and genotypes of VNTR polymorphism did not differ between BD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> groups and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of the eNOS gene seems to be a susceptibility gene for Korean BD and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
