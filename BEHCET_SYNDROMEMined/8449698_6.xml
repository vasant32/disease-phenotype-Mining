<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the correlations of HLA antigens with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, various clinical features and the course of the disease were investigated and the familial clustering of the disease was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found an increased frequency of the HLA-B5 antigen in these series (P &lt; 0.05, relative risk 2.6, confidence interval 1.2-5.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of HLA-B5 was more frequently detected in male (41%, relative risk 4.9, confidence interval 1.8-13.1) than in female patients (9%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher frequency of HLA-B5 was found in male patients with severe vascular involvement, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, than in HLA-B5-positive male patients without these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, ocular involvement, cutaneous features, positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test and of secondary symptoms as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and the duration of development of the complete clinical picture were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found not to be significantly correlated with any of the HLA-A, -B, -C alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Familial clustering was also not found in German patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the low relative risk in the presence of HLA-B5 and the lacking familial clustering, it seems likely that there is a weak immunogenetically determined predisposition for Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-B5-positive male persons of German origin show a higher relative risk to develop or acquire Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than female ones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
