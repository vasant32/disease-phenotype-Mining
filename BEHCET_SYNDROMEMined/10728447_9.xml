<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction is a unique feature of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and, according to the International Study Group (ISG), is among the major criteria required for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction rates in BD have been reported worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction in Israeli BD patients, and its relation to mucocutaneous and systemic manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three patients were studied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom fulfilled the ISG criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mucocutaneous and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> manifestations were analyzed with respect to the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction, and a systemic severity score for BD was calculated according to the potential morbidity and mortality associated with various clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients (44.2%) had a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>-positive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>-negative BD groups showed a similar male:female ratio, age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and mean disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also exhibited similar HLA-B5 levels and a similar frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulcerations</z:e> in close family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mucocutaneous manifestations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> expression, and severity score were similar in patients with and without the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction, although common in Israeli BD patients, is not associated with an increased risk for specific mucocutaneous or systemic manifestations of the disease, and probably does not predict a more severe disease course </plain></SENT>
