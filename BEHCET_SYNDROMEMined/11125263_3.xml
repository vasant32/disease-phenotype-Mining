<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate blood flow velocity changes, pulsatility and resistivity index values of orbital vessels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with or without ocular involvement (groups I and II) and healthy volunteers (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five eyes in the first group, 24 eyes in the second group and 24 eyes in the third group were examined by using color Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic and end-diastolic blood flow velocity measurements, pulsatility and resistivity index values were measured in ophthalmic, central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi>, nasal and temporal ciliary arteries and the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The end-diastolic blood flow velocity measurements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arteries were significantly higher in groups II and III than in group I, but resistivity and pulsatility indexes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arteries were higher in group I than the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in blood flow velocity of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Detection of increased vascular resistance of orbital vessels may predict the diagnosis of ocular involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
