<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in patients with inactive disease, who had significantly higher levels than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status of both groups of patients was significantly lower than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, whole blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity was significantly lower in patients with active versus inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase levels between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there is an increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite this stress, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system is deficient and inadequate, especially in patients who are in an active phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
