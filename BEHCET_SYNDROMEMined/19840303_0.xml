<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, ten patients who developed vulvar ulcerations and denied any kind of sexual contact or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282350" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual abuse</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient information was collated from detailed history, physical, and laboratory examinations including age, menarchal status, type of clothing worn, whether history of oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> or previous vulvar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> had occurred, symptoms at the time of presentation, description of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, laboratory studies including serologies, blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and biopsy results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite multiple evaluations, no patient had a specific medical cause identified to account for their vulvar ulcerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven had bilateral vulvar ulcerations, which we attribute to the practice of wearing tightly fitted pants or polyester underwear frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No recurrences were documented in 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Girls with vulvar ulcerations who have deny being sexually active should be thoroughly evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, and other health problems, but, in addition, should be questioned about use of tight-fitting clothing in the perineal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> irritation because of tight clothing may play a role in causing vulvar ulcerations in this setting </plain></SENT>
