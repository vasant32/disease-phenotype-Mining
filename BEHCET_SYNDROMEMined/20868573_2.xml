<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Case reports on monozygotic (MZ) twins with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) have been few and we are not aware of formal twin studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought the frequency of MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twin births in BS and compared it to a healthy population sample from the same geography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also looked for the concordance rate among the MZ and DZ twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1705 (1039M/666F) patients attending a dedicated BS outpatient clinic and 7761 (3848M/3913F) medical school students were asked about having a MZ or DZ twin sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MZ and DZ twins thus identified among both patients and controls were individually seen at the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA, DNA microsatellite markers and blood groups were typed to further confirm twin- ship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> twins were contacted 8 years later for new emergence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 14 (0.82%) patients with BS and 120 (1.55%) controls who had a twin sibling (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8 (0.47%) patients with BS and 92 (1.19%) controls had a DZ twin sibling (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MZ twin frequency was similar between BS patients (6/1705; 0.35%) and control population (28/7761; 0.36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pairwise concordance rate for BS was 2/6 (95% CI: -0.21-0.88) for MZ and 1/8 (95% CI: -0.17-0.42) for DZ twins (p=0.538) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic effects accounted for 41% of the phenotypic variance for BS among twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 8 years of follow-up, 4 of 6 MZ and 6 of 7 DZ twin pairs were still discordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of MZ twin births in BS is not different than that in the general population while the DZ twins were seen less frequently among the BS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The concordances for BS were higher in MZ compared with DZ twins, suggesting genetic predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the persistence of discordance after 8 years of follow up among the remaining MZ twins demands further research to understand non- genetic factors in causation of BS </plain></SENT>
