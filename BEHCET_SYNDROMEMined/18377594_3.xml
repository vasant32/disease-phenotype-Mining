<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction (PR) to a needle prick is a well-known feature of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although PR is accepted as a major criterion in this disease, there is a lack of a standardized method to measure PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on the positive rate of PR of the application of numerous (one to six) needle pricks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six needle pricks were performed on 105 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the test were noted from the proximal to the distal region for each area of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> combinations (one, two, three, four, five, and six needle pricks) were calculated as percentages by a computer-based program (SPSS version 13 for Windows), and the mean percentage rates were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an increase in the percentage of positive PR rates in each combination relative to the former combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When one needle prick was performed, the mean percentage positive PR rate was 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive PR rates were 19%, 24%, 28%, 30%, and 33% for two, three, four, five and six needle pricks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The greatest increase in the mean percentage of positive PR rates was detected for the application of the two needle prick combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no consensus about the number of needle pricks required to detect PR, and multiple needle pricks have been used in many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that two needle pricks are suitable for the PR skin test as a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
