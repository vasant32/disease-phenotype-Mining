<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> p450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD) gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The polymorphisms of CYP1A1 and MnSOD genes were determined in 51 patients with BD and 91 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A were significantly increased in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no significant difference in the frequencies of MnSOD gene polymorphisms between patients with BD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage disequilibrium was found between CYP1A1 4889G and CYP1A1 6235C in controls and patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a similar finding could not be found between CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that the association of CYP1A1 4889G with BD was dependent on the presence of CYP1A1 4887A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the association of CYP1A1 4887A with BD was dependent on the presence of CYP1A1 4889G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An additive effect of CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A on the susceptibility to BD could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Simultaneous presence of CYP1A1 4889G and 4887A is associated with development of BD in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
