<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system functions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çt's patients by analyzing electrodermal activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 patients and 16 healthy volunteers were accepted for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skin potential recordings were taken at room temperature in a quiet place within a Faraday's cage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean values of basal skin potentials and skin potential responses in the patients' group were reduced when compared with those of the control group ( p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the groups regarding the mean values of latency ( p=0.09) </plain></SENT>
