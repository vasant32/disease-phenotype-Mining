<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SLE, a disease with varied clinical manifestations also has regulatory T cell subset abnormalities in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of sIL-2R in serum of patients with active SLE were higher than in those with other common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with active SLE and an increased percentage of CD4+ CDw29+ helper inducer (memory) and decreased percentage of CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor inducer (virgin) T cell subsets in blood demonstrated elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with clinical manifestations of the disease, the sIL-2R levels in the sera of the patients with active SLE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were higher (mean 1710 units/ml) than those in active SLE with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> (mean 1230 units/ml) or in active SLE with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease (mean 1157 units/ml) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highly elevated levels of sIL-2R in serum may indicate that in vivo T cell activation plays an important role in this disease </plain></SENT>
