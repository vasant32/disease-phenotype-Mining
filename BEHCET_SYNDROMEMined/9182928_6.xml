<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intracellular proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">Messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression was studied by a polymerase chain reaction-based technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interleukin-2 production was suppressed in patients treated with tacrolimus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suppression was found to be due to inhibition of interactions between activated calcineurin (Cn) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), inhibition of cleavage of the autoinhibitory domain of the CnA subunit, and inhibition of heterodimer formation by CnA and CnB subunits, resulting in the absence of NF-AT in nuclei of the T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that T lymphocytes in some BD patients treated with tacrolimus had reduced amounts of FK-506 binding protein (FKBP) in their cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tacrolimus reduces the Cn activity of T cells in vivo by the cumulative effects of several distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is plausible that reduced amounts of FKBP may be associated with diminished clinical efficacy in some BD patients receiving prolonged treatment with tacrolimus </plain></SENT>
