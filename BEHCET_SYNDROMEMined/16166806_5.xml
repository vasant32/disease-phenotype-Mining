<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus by neutrophils and monocytes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and BD patients, phagocytic activity as well as spontaneous and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>)- or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>)-induced activation of their respiratory burst were determined by quantitative flow cytometry using highly specific fluorescence probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PRP does not affect human peripheral blood neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis but dramatically enhances spontaneous or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-induced oxidative burst as well as the intracellular killing of S. aureus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PRP induced the upregulation of the spontaneous or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-induced oxidative burst in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PMNs and monocytes; the number of inflammatory BD cells did neither increase further nor undergo spontaneous or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-stimulated oxidative burst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BD patients, increased spontaneous production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) by neutrophils and monocytes is characterized by impaired intracellular protein-kinase-C (PKC)-dependent oxidative burst regulation as well as over-regulation of chemotaxis/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-mediated respiratory burst induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRP restores rather the impaired intracellular PKC-dependent regulation of ROI production in inflammatory diseased cells than the chemotaxis/induction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-mediated respiratory burst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the regulatory role for PRP on oxidative burst in neutrophils and monocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that PRP differentially affects both chemotaxis- and PKC-dependent oxidative burst in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and inflammatory cells from patients </plain></SENT>
