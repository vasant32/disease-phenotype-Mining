<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> with or without scar formation is an important manifestation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, formal data on the rate of genital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study prospectively the frequency of genital scar formation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods One hundred and two patients (72 males and 30 females) with fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> presenting at a dedicated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome outpatient clinic were followed for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> location, size, and frequency of scar formation were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with similar topical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> were followed in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of scar formation was 66.2% (102/154) in male patients and 60.7% (34/56) in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> were stratified as a function of size, large <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (&gt; or = 1 cm in diameter) developed scars more frequently than did smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (&lt; 1 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of scar formation in male patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> was 89.4% (59/66) and with small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> was 48.9% (43/88) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In females, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> healed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, and the same was true for 40.5% (15/37) of the small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (chi(2) = 18.61, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION About two-thirds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome leave scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of scar formation depends on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
