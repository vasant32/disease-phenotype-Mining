<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Histologic examinations of kidney biopsy specimens from six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032453" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsing polychondritis</z:e> (n = 1), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (n = 3), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (n = 2) were performed after four to 36 months of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients had a variable degree of focal interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000092'>tubular atrophy</z:hpo>, with and without minimal interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar hyalinization was noted in four and <z:mp ids='MP_0005264'>glomerular sclerosis</z:mp> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These renal lesions could not be attributed to underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> or previous drug therapy but were similar to those recently reported in kidney and heart recipients receiving long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> doses were 15 mg/kg body weight in one patient and 10 mg/kg in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maintenance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> doses ranged from 2.5 to 7.5 mg/kg with appropriate trough <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> plasma levels (60 to 130 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A rough correspondence between the extent of the histologic renal changes and the cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was seen, whereas serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increase or the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during treatment did not predict the degree of interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or the presence of arteriolar changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither did a rapid fall in the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level after withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> exclude focal irreversible renal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the histopathologic changes found in the kidneys are potentially progressive, we believe that, until more is known, long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> treatment should be reserved for situations where more established immunosuppression has failed to control an autoimmune process threatening the function of vital organs </plain></SENT>
