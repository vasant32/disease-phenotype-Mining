<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study aims to seek a relationship between the number of thrombotic events and presence of thrombophilic factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Any patient with a vascular problem evaluated for at least one thrombophilic factor was deemed eligible for the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon an evaluation of their medical records, 96 (23.9%) of the 402 patients diagnosed with BD were determined to have a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 96 patients, 72 (75%) had only one thrombotic attack, while the remaining 24 (25%) had two or more thrombotic attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombophilic parameters were evaluated in only 36 of the 72 patients (50%) who had one thrombotic event (Group I) and in 18 of the 24 patients (75%) who had more than one thrombotic event (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with recurrent thrombotic events had a significantly higher incidence of combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> than those patients with only one thrombotic event (8/18, 44%; 4/36, 11%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of the patients free from thrombophilic risk factors was significantly higher in Group I than in Group II (21/36, 58%; 4/18, 22%; p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group II had an increased frequency of combined thrombophilic risk factors (OR 6.4; 95% CI 1.5-25.8) when compared to Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between Groups I and II with respect to clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> in patients with BD may have a role in the development of recurrent thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
