<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of 4 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, refractory to conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> regimens, to which infliximab (anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNFalpha) antibodies) was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures were intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, visual acuity, reduction of daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose, and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 11 months (range: 2-29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received a mean of 8 (range: 3-16) infliximab infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha blockade with infliximab was effective for 2 of our 4 patients: the effect for them was rapid but transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced a thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster</z:e>, a severe adverse effect not previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Response to infliximab was variable in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease for whom conventional immunosuppression had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infliximab allowed the daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose to be reduced for some patients but required repeated infusions </plain></SENT>
