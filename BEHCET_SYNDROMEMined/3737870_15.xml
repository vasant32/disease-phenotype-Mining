<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 28 cases conformed to a definite clinical pattern with haemoptysis, usually accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and dyspnoea, being the major feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Typically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> was associated with active disease at other sites, although the patients often only complained of haemoptysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and haemoptysis, compared to those without haemoptysis, showed a marked male predominance, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> being more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rarely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> occurred in the absence of one or other of the so called 'major' criteria on which the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is usually made, as was so for four of our patients who did not have ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunopathological evidence suggests that the underlying pathogenesis is a pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> which may result in arterial and venous thromboses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infarction</z:e>, pulmonary haemorrhage and pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A role for immune complexes in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is suggested by the finding of circulating immune complexes in association with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi> were initially helpful in treating active disease in the lungs, and at other sites, in most of the patients in whom they were tried, including our five patients, but serious haemoptysis occasionally recurred, despite further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of our patients were initially treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> for a presumed diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, but continued to have haemoptysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of these patients subsequently died following massive haemoptysis, despite good <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The haemoptysis in most of the 28 cases was notable for its severity, and in at least 11 (39.3 per cent), pulmonary haemorrhage was the probable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to haemoptysis occurred within six years of the first episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whilst <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> with haemoptysis is infrequent, it carries a very serious prognosis and for this reason correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment is imperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pulmonary disease</z:e> with haemoptysis should be included as one of the so called 'minor' criteria in the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
