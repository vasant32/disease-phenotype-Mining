<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> after 50 years of age is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to analyze the clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study was conducted from 439 patients diagnosed as BD according to criteria of the International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of patients who were asymptomatic or suffered from only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) until 50 years of age but fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of BD after this age were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age-of-onset</z:hpo> was more than 50 years in nine patients (1.56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, two developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity, one developed papulopustules, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity and ocular symptoms, one developed papulopustules and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity, one developed ocular symptoms, one developed papulopustules and ocular symptoms, and one developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> after the age of 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurologic system was involved in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mucocutaneous symptoms of two patients worsened after interruption of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with neurologic and ocular involvement flared during the follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Since the course of the disease is regarded to be relatively mild in mature patients, it is noteworthy that systemic manifestations such as ocular and neurologic involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> flares developed after the age of 50 years in the limited number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> BD in our series </plain></SENT>
