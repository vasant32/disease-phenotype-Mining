<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, laboratory parameters that could be used as indicators of active disease are investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included a total of 40 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 25 of whom were active and 15 inactive, who applied to Firat University, Firat Medical Center Dermatology, Rheumatology, Physiotherapy, and Ophthalmology outpatient clinics and a control group composed of 30 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum neopterin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum neopterin, CRP, and ESR levels in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients were significantly higher than those in both the inactive group and healthy controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was contemplated that together with serum CRP and ESR, neopterin could be a useful laboratory parameter in patients in whom disease activation could not be determined </plain></SENT>
