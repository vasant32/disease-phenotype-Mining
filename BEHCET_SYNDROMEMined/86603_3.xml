<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C3 conversion products were found in 4 CSFs from nB patients, and the proportions of the split products to the total immunoprecipitate zones were 17, 34, 61 and 63%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSFs with C3 conversion patterns showed higher C3 protein (beta 1C/A) levels compared with those with non-conversion, whereas the differences of C4 protein (beta 1E) levels were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF with C3 conversion patterns also showed apparent inflammatory characteristics indicating blood-CSF barrier involvement which would be deduced from increased alpha 2-macroglobulin and IgA, both being regarded as sensitive internal barrier parameters: but IgA measurement was much higher than usually expected values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the increase in CSF C3 might be initiated by accelerated consumption of complement through the alternative pathway, leading to hypersynthetic or hyperinflux response in CSF </plain></SENT>
