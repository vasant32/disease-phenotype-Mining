<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five persons diagnosed with BD were enrolled into this study, 25 of whom were being followed or had recently been diagnosed with clinically active BD, whereas the remaining 20 were previously diagnosed and had clinically inactive BD for the previous 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty persons were recruited as a healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), resistin, and TNF-α levels were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resistin and TNF-α levels were significantly higher in patients with BD (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05) than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major interest of this study was to investigate the role of resistin in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An elevated resistin level was associated with activation of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated TNF-α and resistin levels could be determined simultaneously, and the presence of these two cytokines together suggests that resistin plays an important role in the pathogenesis and activation of BD </plain></SENT>
