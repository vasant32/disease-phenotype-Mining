<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before deploying the stent graft device for permanent implantation for the saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> located in the descending thoracic aorta, from which feeding arteries for the spinal cord possibly branched, a retrievable stent graft was inserted and evoked spinal cord potential (ESP) were monitored in order to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The original retrievable stent graft, constructed of a self-expandable Z-shaped stainless steel stent covered with e-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>, can be easily withdrawn into a 18 Fr. sheath after deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow into intercostal arteries branching from that part of the descending aorta where the permanent stent graft is planned to be implanted, is intercepted by the retrievable stent graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A change of ESP during the temporary implantation of the device indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> would be caused by permanent implantation of the stent graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, no change of ESP was observed and the patient showed no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The retrievable stent graft was useful for prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> before endoluminal stent graft repair of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the device is not flexible enough to fit a severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tortuous aorta</z:e>, therefore we are obliged to select patients to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further improvement of the device is required to make prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> with the retrievable stent graft possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
