<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective study of 51 of these patients uncovered eight additional subjects with urinary abnormalities, bringing the total to 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The urinary abnormality was, as a rule, discrete, consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>microhematuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These occurred in some patients persistently, in some intermittently, in some alternatingly, and in some simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial finding was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in 10 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> in 11, and both in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the years, eight showed only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo>, seven only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and ten, both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The urinary sediment contained neither leukocytes nor casts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pyelographies were unrevealing when performed and rectal biopsies uncovered no new instance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a benign renal lesion occurs in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, whose pathological substrate, though not yet defined, is not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
