<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-BCP 54 antibody levels remained within a very narrow range, at least twofold higher than those of controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the presence of specific anti-BCP 54 autoantibodies in sera from a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patient and suggest that autoantibodies may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
