<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although the etiopathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) remains unknown, increased neutrophil functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and excessive production of reactive oxygen species, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>, may be responsible for the oxidative tissue damage observed in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">Cytochrome P-450</z:chebi> are a multigene family of enzymes involved in the detoxification and occasional activation of a wide variety of chemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two subjects with BD and 107 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 were performed by real-time PCR with a LightCycler instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We researched associations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">CYP</z:chebi> polymorphisms and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and heterozygous CYP2C19*2 genotypes were 66.1% and 33.9% in the patients and 83.2% and 16.8% in the controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a 2.53-fold increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in individuals with the CYP2C19*2 heterozygous genotype (OR = 2.53; 95% CI, 1.22-5.25) when compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C19*3 gene polymorphisms were not related to an increased risk of developing BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed that patients with BD presented with a higher prevalence of the heterozygous CYP2C19*2 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hereditary deficiencies of this enzyme activity may lead to an imbalance between pro- and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> systems, resulting in the formation of excessive reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
