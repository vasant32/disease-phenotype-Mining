<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no published paper with respect to its association with HLA class I and class II among the Turkish people who live in the eastern region of Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as it is known that B51 antigen is encoded by 21 alleles, B*5101-5121, HLA-B51 allele typing was performed, as well as HLA class I and class II genotyping of 75 patients with the disease and the 54 individuals in the matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result shows that the HLA-B51 frequency was significantly higher (58.66%) in the patient group, compared to that in the control group (18.51%) (OR = 6.245) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subtyping of B51 alleles, 44 B51-positive patients possessed B*5101 (45.5%), B*5108 (25%), B*5105 (9.1%) and B*5104 (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the HLA-B51 allelic distribution between the patient group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, homozygous carriers of HLA-B51 showed considerably high risk (OR = 2.647) in the patient group, compared to that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the genotyping of class II HLA alleles, while HLA-DRB1*04 (45.3%) and HLA-DRB1*07 (24%) were the predominant alleles in the patient group, DRB1*11 (50%) appeared to be more common in the control group </plain></SENT>
