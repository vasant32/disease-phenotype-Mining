<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is no disease activity index (DAI) currently available that can objectively assess the disease status of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a novel specific DAI for intestinal BD through a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Items included in the index were produced and graded by experts in intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two separate cohorts of patients (weighting and validation cohorts) with intestinal BD were prospectively enrolled, and their clinical and laboratory data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through weighting items by multiple regression modeling, the DAI for intestinal BD (DAIBD) was derived using the weighting cohort and validated using the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The index's responsiveness was evaluated using a longitudinal cohort derived from the weighting cohort at a follow-up visit 2-3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 110 patients with intestinal BD were enrolled in the weighting cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 17 items selected by the experts accounted for 86.8% of the physician's global assessment (<z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi>) variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DAIBD calculated with gradations of weighted items correlated more strongly with <z:chebi fb="168" ids="26334,27470">PGA</z:chebi> (r=0.850) than did the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> activity index (CDAI) (r=0.649) in 50 patients of the validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, quiescent, mild, moderate, and severe could be discriminated using the best cutoff scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The DAIBD showed much higher responsiveness than did the CDAI (r=0.812 vs. 0.645, respectively) in 109 patients in the longitudinal cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This novel DAIBD is an easy, valid, and responsive index to assess disease activity and can be useful to physicians who treat intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
