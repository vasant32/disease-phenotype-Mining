<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate a potential relationship between I/D polymorphism within intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene located on human chromosome 17 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from 35 Turkish patients diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease according to the International Study Group criteria and 150 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of I and D (insertion and deletion) alleles in intron 16 of the ACE gene in these DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found differences in ACE I/D polymorphism between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and healthy controls (chi2=4.61, d.f.=1, p=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients, the D allele frequency was 84.3% and I allele frequency 15.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An association between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and ACE polymorphism may provide a useful basis for future molecular studies and therapeutic approaches in this complex disease </plain></SENT>
