<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of a group of pediatric patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) who presented at least 1 episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during their disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We made a retrospective chart review of the clinical, biological, and radiological data of children with BD who presented at least 1 episode of either arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted from both an international pediatric <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet cohort and files referred from 7 French centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of BD was based on the criteria of the International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main locations for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were the cerebral sinuses, in 11 patients (52.4%); and lower limbs, in 9 patients (40.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrent episodes were observed in 4 patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> measurements were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 14 patients out of 21, while anticardiolipin antibodies were positive in 4 patients, and 2 out of 21 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi> were also added for variable periods in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients out of 21 were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, then anti-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi>) and 3 with antiplatelets (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thromboses are a serious complication of BD and may occur early in the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of thrombophilic markers could increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD, but the size of our population does not allow any conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An international cohort (PED-BD) is currently in place and will allow study of such cases longitudinally, as well as assessment of the elements that correlate with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in children with BD </plain></SENT>
