<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trace elements function as cofactors to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system and trace elements were investigated in many different studies, including BD, but these subjects have not been investigated as a whole in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the antioxidative system and trace elements in BD to contribute to the knowledge of pathogenesis and treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) activities together with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> (Se), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> (Mn), and iron (Fe) levels in plasma and erythrocytes of 50 patients with BD and 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that in patients with BD, erythrocyte GSH-Px and SOD activities and erythrocyte Se, plasma Fe, Mn, and Zn levels were significantly lower than those of controls and that plasma Cu, erythrocyte Zn, and Mn levels were significantly higher in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insufficient <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities were observed in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) of this phenomenon is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, supplementation with trace elements involved in the antioxidative processes may increase scavenger enzyme activities, and consequently, an improvement in clinical symptoms may be expected </plain></SENT>
