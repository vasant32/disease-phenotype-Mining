<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Where possible, patients with and without active disease were studied during and in the absence of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with active disease neutrophil migration was frequently greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, particularly with respect to numbers of cells migrating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also an increased frequency of emigrating neutrophils with less or more nuclear lobes than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients in whom function of skin window neutrophils was studied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> reduction and phagocytosis and killing of Candida guilliermondiae were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monocyte component of the skin window was more often reduced in patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment did not exert a major effect on leucocyte migration, though the doses involved were relatively small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil abnormalities were common in patients and particularly those with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neutrophil <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> may have an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
