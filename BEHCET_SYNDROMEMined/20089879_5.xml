<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Immune responses to retina-specific autoantigens, including S antigen (S-Ag) and interphotoreceptor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> binding protein (IRBP), have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors examined whether immune responses to IRBP and S-Ag in BD patients can be characterized by cytokine production profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and healthy controls, and each sample was cultured with IRBP, S-Ag, or purified protein derivative (<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of culture, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha concentrations in supernatants were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PBMCs from BD patients and healthy controls produced IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha on stimulation with IRBP or S-Ag, as well as <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> stimulation, immunity against which was acquired by Bacille Calmette-Guérin immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-17 and IFN-gamma production was significantly higher when PBMCs were stimulated with IRBP than with S-Ag, whereas the reverse was observed for IL-6 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IRBP-stimulated IL-6, IFN-gamma, and IL-17 production was higher in BD patients than in healthy controls, though IL-10 production was not different between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, IRBP-stimulated IFN-gamma production was significantly higher in BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> than in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immune responses to both IRBP and S-Ag were observed even in PBMCs of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the present results suggested that <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> autoantigen-stimulated IL-6, IL-17, and especially IFN-gamma production would be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
