<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: We present 3 patients (2 men and 1 women) diagnosed as having <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, according to the criteria of the 'International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease' of 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical findings in these patients, the results of investigations done (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> or CT, evoked potentials-PEV, PESS, PEATC-EEG, ECN, CSF and neuropsychological tests), their course and response to treatment with hyperimmune human gammaglobulim at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients had repeated episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and alterations of the cranial nerves; two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and two had signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at some time during their illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient died and the other two survived with severe disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial CT showed a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in one patient; evoked potentials showed axon damage in the two patients in whom this was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the only patient in whom ECN was done, signs of axonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients there was pleocytosis in the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients in whom hyperimmune human gammaglobulin was given, the results were: one improved after this treatment; in the other there was clinical deterioration, but this was considered to be secondary to a curettage done the day before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of neurological findings in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease not caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> worsens the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
