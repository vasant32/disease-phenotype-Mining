<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NATURE OF THE STUDY: Case report and review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient had a complete autopsy, drug screen and serological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A medical history was obtained and the literature was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 10-year-old African-American boy had massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> while at home and died shortly thereafter in the emergency department of a local hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had had two other episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> in the past 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, he had bilateral inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the lower lobe branches of the pulmonary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had eroded into the adjacent bronchus and accounted for the fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The right ventricle had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006685'>endocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The child did not have oral, genital, eye or <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> at autopsy, or by clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on the autopsy findings, a diagnosis of BD was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present the very unusual case of a 10-year-old African-American boy who died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> resulting from bilateral pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> caused by BD </plain></SENT>
