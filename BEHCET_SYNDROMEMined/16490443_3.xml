<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no data evaluating the value of Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac involvement and the LV function at rest and at the end of isometric exercise by pulse-wave Doppler and DTI methods in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 50 control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dimensions of cardiac chambers, aortic root dimension, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo>, and systolic function were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean E/A ratio was significantly lower in patients than controls (1.22 +/- .09 vs 1.36 +/- 0.30, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The E/A ratio was &lt;1 in 12 patients (22%) and in 3 controls (6%) (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By DTI, no difference was found in the mean S-, e-, and a-wave velocities, and e/a ratio between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The e/a ratio was &lt;1 in 13 patients (24.1%) and in 7 controls (14%) (p = 0.2) by DTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the mitral pulse-wave Doppler and DTI parameters in patient and control groups at the end of exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of cardiac pathology in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease did not differ appreciably from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the LV systolic and diastolic functions in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and controls were similar not only at rest but also at the end of exercise </plain></SENT>
