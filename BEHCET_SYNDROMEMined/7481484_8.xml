<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with BD fulfilling the International Study Group Criteria for the diagnosis of BD and 20 healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had active, and 20 patients had inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum sICAM-1 was determined by a sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) sICAM-1 level was significantly higher in the whole BD group (297.3 +/- 86.6 ng/ml) than in the healthy controls (213 +/- 83.5 ng/ml; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean sICAM-1 levels in active and inactive BD patients were 315.7 +/- 76.3 ng/ml and 258.3 +/- 73.3 ng/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean sICAM-1 level in active patients was significantly higher than in inactive patients and healthy controls (P &lt; 0.02 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference in mean sICAM-1 levels was found between inactive BD patients and healthy controls (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between the mean sICAM-1 levels of active patients with (351.3 +/- 77.2 ng/ml) or without vascular lesions (292 +/- 68.8; P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In spite of a positive correlation between disease activity and both erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP; P &lt; 0.01), we found no correlation between sICAM-1 and either of them (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The elevated levels of sICAM-1 may be due to endothelial cell activation and/or damage or may be the result of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
