<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three patients (63 eyes) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients underwent simultaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography with a double detector of scanning laser ophthalmoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Angiographic findings recorded on videotapes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relation of angiographic findings with systemic activity and aqueous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography showed leakage in varying degrees from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels in 30 patients (53 eyes, 84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ICG angiographic findings were choroidal vascular wall staining in 16 eyes (25%), hyperfluorescent spots in 42 eyes (66%) and hypofluorescent plaques in 22 eyes (35%), both of which were not evident with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>, leakage from choroidal vessels in 3 eyes (5%), and irregular filling of choriocapillaris in 11 eyes (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings did not have a statistically significant correlation with the presence or absence of aqueous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulcerations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease showed choroidal abnormalities, which could be revealed only by ICG angiography, but not with funduscopy or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous ICG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography would be useful for examining choroidal lesions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
