<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used whole blood cytometry to determine the exposure of CD62 on the surface of platelets and the expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of circulating red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microparticle and microaggregate formation from platelets were also determined in a well-classified group of 72 patients (39 males, 33 females, aged 46.5 +/- 12.5 years) with BD, in comparison with a well-matched control group of 72 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed no differences in the above-mentioned parameters when BD patients and controls were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when we compared BD patients with/without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> using these parameters, there were significant differences between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BD patients with previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had a higher percentage of circulating CD62-positive platelets and a higher number of circulating microaggregates than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, suggesting that platelet activation may be involved in the development of thrombotic events in these patients </plain></SENT>
