<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the reported hemostatic abnormalities are related to the inflammatory syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the activity of antithrombin III, protein C and protein S (PS), in 30 patients with BD and in 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> antecedents were found in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombin III and protein C were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, however free PS and PSactivity were significantly decreased in patients as compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PS deficiency detected in eight patients, was associated to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 6 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between free PS/total PS ratio and C4bBP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to PS were screened by ELISA and were present in 6 patients, associated to PS deficiency in 4, and to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> antecedents in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PS deficiency was transient in two patients, associated to a persistent antiPS in one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that auto-immune acquired PS deficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in BD </plain></SENT>
