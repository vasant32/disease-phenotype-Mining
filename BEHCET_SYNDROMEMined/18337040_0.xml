<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTs of 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 20 others in a control group have been evaluated retrospectively for PA (septal, reticular, nodular, atelectatic opacities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight out of 50 patients (16%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> showed PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three out of 20 (15%) in the control group showed PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients and the control group regarding pulmonary alterations (p=0.917) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in the disease duration, ages and sex in either group in those with and without PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pulmonary alterations can be seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, but these alterations are not significant </plain></SENT>
