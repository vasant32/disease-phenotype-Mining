<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) occurs in 4%-48% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) SPECT findings in BD patients and eventually to detect <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement by depicting cerebral blood flow disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi>-99m-HMPAO brain SPECT was performed on 33 consecutive BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cortical uptake was done using an automatic program that generated 32 regions of interest (ROIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An uptake index for each ROI was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reference values were obtained from a healthy control group (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients also had an MRI study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve of 32 patients (36%) presented with a clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SPECT and visual evaluation revealed that 17 patients (51.5%) had abnormalities; 9 of 25 MRI studies (36%) were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the quantitative approach for SPECT, 23 patients (69.7%) had abnormally low values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six of 12 patients with neurological symptoms had a visually abnormal SPECT scan, whereas quantitative analysis showed abnormalities in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 patients with no neurological findings, 9 had abnormal SPECT results, and 12 had low uptake indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HMPAO brain SPECT shows high rates of cerebral blood flow abnormalities in BD patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms, and it also is frequently abnormal in asymptomatic BD patients who have no abnormalities on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared with visual analysis, quantitative analysis detects an even higher rate of SPECT changes in BD patients </plain></SENT>
