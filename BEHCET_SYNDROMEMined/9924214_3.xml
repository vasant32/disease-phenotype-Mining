<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was designed to evaluate EA in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and to see if this parameter is predictive for the future development of vascular complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> of various organ systems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EA was measured by a photometric Myrenne aggregometer in 38 patients with BD at the time of initial diagnosis and in 40 age and sex matched healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow up period of 13.5 months, 13 patients developed vascular-ocular complications (eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and four both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were further divided into two groups: BD-a with mucocutaneous symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> only; BD-b with associated vascular-ocular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EA values at high shear rate (M) and at low shear rate (M1) were compared among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EA values at M and M1 were significantly higher in BD-b than BD-a and HC (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that determination of EA rates might be useful to identify subgroups who are likely candidates for developing vascular-ocular complications in BD and management of factors known to affect blood rheology might be beneficial </plain></SENT>
