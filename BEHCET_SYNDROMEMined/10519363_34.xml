<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed HLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) polymorphism analysis in BD and evaluated their contribution to ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 102 patients and 115 controls of Middle Eastern descent were investigated by HLA and B*51 subtyping using novel primers, and by LT alpha NCo 1 and TNF 308 promoter polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the HLA-B*51 family of alleles was raised in patients compared to controls (66% vs. 15%, Pc=2.5x10(-12), OR=10.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) of this group of alleles for subgroups of patients was as follows: non-ocular patients 7.8, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ocular patients 12.6, blind patients &gt;22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51 subtyping detected B*5101, 07, 08 and 09 alleles, with a similar frequency among patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-Cw*1602 was associated with B*5108, but was not an independent risk factor for disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LT alpha (TNFB*2) allele was associated with HLA-B*51 among patients and the frequency of this allele was significantly higher among completely blind patients compared to both non-ocular patients (P=0.048, OR &gt;3.6) and to healthy controls (P=0.022, OR &gt;4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rare TNF-2 polymorphism at the TNF -308 promoter position was associated with HLA-B*50 (not B*51), and was not associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this population the HLA*B51 family of alleles is a strong risk factor for BD, and in particular the development of ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51 subtyping did not define new markers for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A primary role for TNF gne polymorphisms in BD was not identified, but co-expression of the TNFB*2 allele with HLA-B*51 may contribute to severity of ocular disease </plain></SENT>
