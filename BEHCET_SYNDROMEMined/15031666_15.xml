<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although soluble (s) forms of 4-1BB (s4-1BB) and 4-1BB legand (s4-1BBL) have been detected in the sera of RA patients, their significance is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the serum levels of s4-1BB and s4-1BBL in RA patients with those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of s4-1BB and s4-1BBL were significantly higher in RA patients compared with healthy controls, SLE or BD patients, and the abundance was correlated with disease severity in patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of s4-1BB in RA patients were inversely corroborated with 4-1BB expression levels on activated T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a correlation between serum levels of s4-1BB and s4-1BBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The augmented secretion of s4-1BB and s4-1BBL levels into the serum may reflect the clinical symptoms of RA and levels of s4-1BB and s4-1BBL in sera at the time of diagnosis may be indicative of the severity and outcome of RA </plain></SENT>
