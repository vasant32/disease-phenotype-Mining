<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three fourths of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions occur around the Bartholin gland ducts or between them posteriorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic study of tissues from seven patients has not shown a characteristic pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and fails to confirm a reported association between these lesions and the minor vestibular glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These histologic studies and an in-depth clinical and epidemiologic investigation in nine patients, including microbiologic studies to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
