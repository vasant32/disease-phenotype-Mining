<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels of aCL and aGPI were determined by conventional enzyme immunoassay for both IgG and IgM classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve (25.5%) patients with BD were positive for IgG or IgM aCL and no patient was positive for aGPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven (78.6%) patients with SLE were also positive for aCL and among them, 8 (72.7%) patients were positive for aGPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive IgG aCL patients with BD showed lower level of IgG aCL than those with SLE (15.7+/-7.3 vs 34.1+/-16.0 GPL, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no relation between the presence of aCL in BD and either dinical activity or clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients with BD, aCL are found but it would not be associated with aGPI as they are in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with BD, aCL seem to be authentic aCL unlike those in patients with SLE and may not be related with vascular complications in BD </plain></SENT>
