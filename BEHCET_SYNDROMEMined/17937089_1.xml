<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients diagnosed with BD were referred from September 2002 to September 2005 to the Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Reproduction of the Second University of Naples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The International Study Group (ISG) Criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease (27) was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi>; clobetasol; and interferon alpha-2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Every month <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a complete blood count, platelet count, and liver function test </plain></SENT>
