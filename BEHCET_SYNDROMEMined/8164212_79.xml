<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As cytokines are involved in the regulation of immune responses and inflammatory reactions, we investigated whether they may play a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated spontaneous and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) stimulated production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, IL-8 and granulocyte monocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by peripheral blood monocytes from 21 patients with BD, 10 healthy controls and 10 patients with familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>), another <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> generation and surface antigen expression by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The spontaneous secretion of TNF alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 by monocytes was significantly increased in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secretion of TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 was found to be in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in asymptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LPS stimulated production of TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1 and IL-8 was significantly increased in patients with BD, without any correlation with BD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, PMN spontaneously generated significant amounts of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that monocyte and PMN dysfunctions may play a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
