<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate SP, CGRP and serum interleukin (IL)-8 levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and to explore the relationship of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with BD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 30 patients with BD, and 30 healthy individuals acted as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of SP, CGRP and IL-8 were determined by micro-ELISA test during the active and inactive disease periods of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data were compared with each other and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Active and inactive periods of BD were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean +/- SD serum CGRP (ng/ml) and IL-8 levels (pg/ml) in inactive BD (5.87 +/- 2.49 and 0.62 +/- 0.24, respectively) were significantly higher than the control group (4.74 +/- 1.17 and 0.46 +/- 0.11) (P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between serum CGRP and IL-8 levels in active BD were also significantly higher than in inactive BD (P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum SP values (ng/ml) in active BD (18.27 +/- 5.38) were significantly higher than in inactive BD (15.26 +/- 5.74) and controls (12.6 +/- 4.45) (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), whereas the difference between the serum SP values in inactive BD and the control group was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum SP and CGRP may have a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum IL-8, SP and CGRP levels can be used as laboratory parameters indicating activity in BD </plain></SENT>
