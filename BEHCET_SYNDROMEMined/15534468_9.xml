<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six eyes of 26 patients with uveitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who underwent trabeculectomy with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> between 1996 and 2001 were reviewed in this retrospective, noncomparative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trabeculectomy + <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> in concentration of 0.4 mg/mL for 3 minutes was performed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were control of IOP, the number of antiglaucoma medications required to achieve the desired IOP, visual acuity and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical success was defined as IOP less than 22 mm Hg and greater than 5 mm Hg without additional further <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> surgery or loss of light perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative probability of success was 83.3% at 1 year, 76.2% at 2 years, 70% at 3 years, 66.7% at 4 years and 62.5% at 5 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 40.0+/-18.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up 23% of the patients required no antiglaucoma medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Best-corrected visual acuity improved or remained within two lines of preoperative visual acuity in 19 eyes (73.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glaucomatous (1 eye 3.8%) and nonglaucomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> (3 eyes 11.5%) was the most frequent reason for visual decrease (total 4 eyes 15.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> formation in 6 eyes (23.1%), <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> leakage in 4 eyes (15.3%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal effusion</z:e> in 3 eyes (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000667'>Phthisis bulbi</z:hpo> was found in one (3.8%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Trabeculectomy and intraoperative application of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> appears to provide long term safety and effectiveness in uveitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
