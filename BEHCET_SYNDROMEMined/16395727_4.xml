<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This open prospective study was to assess the efficacy of selective granulocytapheresis in patients with refractory uveoretinitis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients aged 20-56 years were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocytapheresis was done with an Adacolumn filled with cellulose <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> leucocyte carries or beads that adsorb granulocytes and monocytes from the blood in the column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient received 5 Adacolumn sessions at one session/week over 5 consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to allow each patient to serve as his or her own control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total numbers of ocular attacks (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) were monitored for 6 months before and after 5 Adacolumn sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (mean +/- SD) per patient for the 6 months before Adacolumn was 4.21 +/- 1.6 and for the 6 months post Adacolumn was 2.93 +/- 1.39 ( P = 0.0275) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (64%) improved and 5 did not change or worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, for a sub-group (n = 7) with duration of BD &gt; or =5 years, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> were 4.71 +/- 1.89 for the first 6 months and 2.29 +/- 1.38 for the second 6 months ( P = 0.0054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for a sub-group (n = 7) with duration of BD&lt;5 years were 3.71 +/- 1.25 and 3.57 +/- 1.13, indicating that patients with long duration of BD are better responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that granulocytapheresis might be effective and safe for patients with refractory ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to fully evaluate the clinical efficacy of granulocytapheresis for BD </plain></SENT>
