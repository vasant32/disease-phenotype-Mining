<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 28 male consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease ( group A, aged 19-59, median 35.5 years) and 15 male healthy control subjects ( group B, aged 25-45, median 35 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each subject at the study enrollment stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured serum leptin, neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age and BMI between the patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and the control group were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>White cell count and ESR values were found to be significantly higher among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and ocular involvement (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median serum leptin concentrations were as follows: group A: 2.66 (0.57-7.02 ng/ml) and in group B: 2.55 (1.55-7.82 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum leptin level does not correlate with ocular involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
