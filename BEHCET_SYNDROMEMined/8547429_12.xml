<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other features include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by a relapsing inflammatory process of unknown aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) is an <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-like particle with a large <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> called <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) attached to its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B moiety through one or more disulphide bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) is related to plasminogen from which the enzyme plasmin, that hydrolyses fibrin blood clots, is released by tissue plasminogen activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unique structural features of Lp(A) give it the potential for atherogenic and thrombogenic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study 35% of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were shown to have higher Lp(a) concentrations than the cut-off point (0.30 g/l) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma Lp(a) concentrations in the remission period were also found to be lower than during the active period in the same patients (23% decreased) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) showed significant correlations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was concluded that the fluctuations of plasma Lp(a) levels with the activity of disease may be a contributing risk factor in the development of thrombogenic complications in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
