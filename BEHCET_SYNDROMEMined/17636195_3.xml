<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report presents computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography findings in 3 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imaging findings were confirmed by surgery in 1 patient and by angiography in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo>, 1 of which had already ruptured and had thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other had unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> accompanied with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive imaging modalities minimize any risk of endothelial damage and can be an alternative to angiography in assessment of pulmonary and cardiac involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
