<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 129 clinical case patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients fulfilled the criteria of the international study group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and were followed at the department of internal medicine of the university hospital of Sfax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA class I phenotyping was performed by microlymphocytotoxicity complement dependent for our 129 patients and for 123 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used the program SPSS 11.0 to analyse clinical data and to compare HLA class I antigen distribution between these two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group concerned a total of 129 patients (81 males and 48 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was of 32 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 antigen was the only antigen significantly more frequent among patients (24.81%) than controls (9.76%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-B44 was significantly more frequent among patients having familial history of recurrent buccal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA-A11 antigen was associated with early disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and HLA-A1 was negatively associated with severe form of the disease (neurological, vascular or ocular manifestations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the HLA-B51 association with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, B51 frequency in South Tunisian patients was lower than that found in other studies regardless of the clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
