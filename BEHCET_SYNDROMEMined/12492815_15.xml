<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously suggested that in a Japanese population the susceptible locus for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is HLA-B51 itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm this finding in another population, we performed HLA class I typing using the PCR-SSP method and analyzed eight polymorphic markers distributed within 1100 kb around the HLA-B gene using automated sequencer and subsequent automated fragment detection by fluorescent-based technology with the DNA samples of 84 Iranian patients with BD and 87 healthy ethnically matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, three microsatellite alleles (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6, MIB-348, C1-4-1-217) and HLA-B51 were found to be strongly associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these alleles HLA-B51 is the most strongly associated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no alleles that were increased in allele frequency at any microsatellite loci centromeric of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> or telomeric of HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, HLA-B51 was confirmed to be by far the most strongly associated gene with BD in an Iranian population </plain></SENT>
