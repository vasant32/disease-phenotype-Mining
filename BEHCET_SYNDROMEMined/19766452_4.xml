<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> that can be a possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When aortic valve replacement is performed in patients with BD, unless preoperative immunosuppressive therapy and special operative techniques are used, the postoperative course is usually complicated by valve dehiscence, necessitating another operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative diagnosis of BD is challenging because of its protean manifestations, but an early diagnosis is associated with a more favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 2008, 15 patients with final diagnoses of BD underwent aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records and echocardiographic findings were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 15 patients, only 2 were diagnosed as having BD prior to first operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve underwent repeat open-heart surgery because of valve dehiscence, and 6 of these 12 patients eventually died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients with available echocardiographic findings of native valve <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, echocardiography demonstrated characteristic aneurysmal changes and redundant coronary cusp motion in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vegetation-like mobile lesions and echo-free spaces mimicking <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> pockets led to misdiagnoses of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 7 patients at least once during their clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> requiring permanent pacemaker insertion developed in 5 patients, especially those with echo-free spaces in the periannular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dismal prognoses are almost inevitable unless etiologic diagnoses are made prior to surgery in patients with BD and AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is important to diagnose BD preoperatively, and the diagnostic importance of echocardiographic findings should be kept in mind when evaluating patients with AR </plain></SENT>
