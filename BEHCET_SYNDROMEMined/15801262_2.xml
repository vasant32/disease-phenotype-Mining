<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased production of NO during several inflammatory and infectious processes has been recently postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the serum NO levels in patients with active and inactive BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients with BD, 30 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with BD were separated into two groups: clinically active (n = 24) and inactive (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A blood sample was collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects in order to determine their serum NO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with active BD, higher serum levels of NO metabolite were found in comparison with patients with inactive BD, in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, or healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also found higher serum NO metabolite levels in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> than in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with inactive BD, statistically significant higher levels of serum NO levels were found in comparison with the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, we found no statistically significant difference between the patients with inactive BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, which indicated that inactive BD cannot be distinguished from <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> by serum NO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that serum NO levels may be an important marker for estimating the severity of BD </plain></SENT>
