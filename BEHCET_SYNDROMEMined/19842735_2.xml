<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare long-term outcomes of endovascular and surgical treatment of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (VBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 912 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who were seen between May 1995 and January 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 34 (3.7%) patients with 39 non-cerebral aneurysmal lesions were diagnosed with VBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between February 1998 and November 2006, 16 VBD patients (14 men; mean age 39.2+/-9.2 years, range 25-63) were treated for 20 arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with an endovascular technique (stent-graft and/or coil embolization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received immunosuppressive therapy (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 60 mg/d) before endovascular therapy to induce remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From February 1993 to January 2007, 8 arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 7 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men; mean age 33.0+/-7.9 years, range 25-51) were treated with surgical graft interposition over 31.5+/-23.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The endovascular procedure was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 47.6+/-41.8 months, during which 4 complications in 3 patients (3/16, 18.8%) occurred (2 occluded stent-grafts and 2 access site pseudoaneurysm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative primary patency rate in the endovascular group was 89% at 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 7 patients undergoing graft interposition for 8 arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 3 (42.9%) events occurred in follow-up: 2 recurrent pseudoaneurysms and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment is performed whenever possible because of the high risk of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was effective and safe, with an acceptable vascular complication rate and excellent patency of the treated site </plain></SENT>
