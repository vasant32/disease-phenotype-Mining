<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty-two patients with BD and 24 sex and age matched healthy subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>pure-tone audiometry including high frequencies (250-16000Hz) and DPOAE were performed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of the audiological evaluation were compared and correlation between the audiologic status and clinical manifestations of the BD were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0008619'>Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss</z:hpo> was detected in 27 (64.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hearing thresholds were found to be higher in patients with BD at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the frequencies except at 500Hz when compared to control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in the hearing levels tend to increase in high frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with control group, distortion products and SNR of the BD patients were lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the tested frequencies (p&lt;0.05) which indicates weaker outer hair cell motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the clinical manifestations and the audiological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Even having hearing levels within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in speech frequencies, increased hearing thresholds in high frequencies and decreased signal-noise ratios (SNR) in distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) indicate a cochlear involvement in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
