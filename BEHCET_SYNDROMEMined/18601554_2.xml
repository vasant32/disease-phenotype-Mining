<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> photobleaches rapidly, and the bleaching is known to be oxygen dependent, and at the same time, fractionation or reduced irradiance treatments have been shown to significantly increase efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, in vivo measurement of either the bleaching rate and/or the total bleaching yield could be used to track the deposited dose in tissue and determine the optimal treatment plans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in rat esophagus and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100580'>Barrett's esophagus</z:hpo> are measured during <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in both continuous and fractionated light delivery treatment, and the bleaching is quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reducing the optical irradiance from 50 to 25 mWcm did not significantly alter photobleaching in rat esophagus, but fractionation of the light at 1-min on and off intervals did increase photobleaching up to 10% more (p value=0.02) and up to 25% more in the human Barrett's tissue (p value&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While two different tissues and two different dosimetry systems are used, the data support the overall hypothesis that light fractionation in ALA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> esophageal treatments should have a beneficial effect on the total treatment effect </plain></SENT>
