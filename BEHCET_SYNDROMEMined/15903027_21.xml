<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BD is higher in the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>), is also known to be highly prevalent in these populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BD is higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patient population than in populations known to be rich in BD  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> have some pathophysiological features in common and they result from inappropriate activation of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of both diseases can mimic each other and the coexistence of both diseases in the same patient has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given that BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> have similar pathophysiological, epidemiological, and clinical features, we hypothesized that the gene responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, MEFV, may also play a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two BD patients who had no symptoms and family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and 66 healthy controls were screened for common MEFV gene mutations (E148Q, M680I, M694V, and V726A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (36%) displayed MEFV mutations (nine M694V, five E148Q, and one M680I) and mutation rates were significantly elevated compared to 66 (11%) healthy controls (p = 0.0034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The occurrence of frequent MEFV mutations in BD patients suggests that the MEFV gene is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
