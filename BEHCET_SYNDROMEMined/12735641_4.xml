<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four cases were positive for HSV-1; 1 of 11 Behçet's disease cases, 2 of 3 Sweet's disease cases and 1 of 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that there might be some relationship between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and the presence of HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 DNA and that HHV-6 and HHV-7 do not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNAs were also detected in non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease lesions, suggesting that HSV-1/2 is not correlated to the direct pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
