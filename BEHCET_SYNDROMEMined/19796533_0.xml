<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Studies from Israel and Turkey have proposed that patient clusters with discriminating clinical features may exist in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD); such clusters could help to better understand pathogenetic mechanisms and guide therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we searched for specific associations between each disease manifestation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other manifestations in Greek patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Specific clinical features were retrospectively recorded in 142 consecutive patients (80 men) fulfilling the International Study Group criteria, seen between 2000-2008 in our Departments (mean follow-up of 37 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> possible associations between distinct clinical features were examined; further analysis in relation to HLA-B51 status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test positivity, available in 89 patients, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant associations between various manifestations of BD were found, either among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, or among men or women analysed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was present more frequently in men, but not women, who were HLA-B51 carriers (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001) and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> involvement (p=0.008) in women, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> in men (p=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In contrast to studies from other countries, no subgroups of patients with distinct positive or negative associations between clinical features were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 may have some prognostic significance in men only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether differences in disease expression between geographical areas may reflect different triggers of pathogenetic mechanisms operating among ethnic groups could be further explored in comparative studies </plain></SENT>
