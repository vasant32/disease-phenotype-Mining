<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of specific polymorphisms of interleukin 1 (IL-1) A, IL-1B and IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1RN) genes could affect the susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 132 BD patients and 105 healthy controls were genotyped for IL-1A -889, IL-1B -511, -35, +5810, +5887, and IL-1RN +8006, +8061, +9589, +11,100 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and IL-1RN 86-bp variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism. chi 2-analysis was used to compare the allele and genotype frequencies of the cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-1A and IL-1B haplotypes were reconstructed using the Phase program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>Inheritance</z:hpo> of the C allele of the IL-1A -889 polymorphism was associated with BD (OR=2.0, P=0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the IL-1A -889C/IL-1B +5887T haplotype was identified as an increased risk for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IL-1A -889 and IL-1B +5887 CC/TT combined genotype was significantly more observed in BD cases than in controls (57.5 vs 38.1%, OR=2.2, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association with BD was found for other investigated polymorphisms in the IL-1B and IL-1RN genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Susceptibility to BD is increased in individuals carrying both the IL-1A -889C and IL-1B +5887T haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals who are both homozygous CC at IL-1A -889 and TT at IL-1B +5887 appear to have twice the risk of developing BD as individuals having other IL-1A -889/IL-1B +5887 genotypes </plain></SENT>
