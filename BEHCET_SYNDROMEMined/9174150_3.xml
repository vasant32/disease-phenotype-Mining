<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing analysis of the second and third exon of this new B allele revealed that B42AND was identical to B*4201 except for a single T to C substitution at position 97 of exon 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This substitution results in histidine (CAC) at codon 9 in B42AND instead of tyrosine (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>) in B*4201 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antigen frequency of B42AND in a Saudi Arabian population was around 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This novel B42AND has officially been named HLA-B*4202 </plain></SENT>
