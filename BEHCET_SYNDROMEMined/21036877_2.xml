<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of disease is &lt;16 years, disease duration is ≤3 years, future follow-up duration is ≥4 years and informed consent is obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expert committee has classified the included patients into: definite paediatric BD (PED-BD), probable PED-BD and no PED-BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis is performed to compare the three groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Centres document their patients into a single database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At January 2010, 110 patients (56 males/54 females) have been included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age at first symptom: 8.1 years (median 8.2 years) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 106 first evaluations have been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients underwent the first-year evaluation, and 36 had no new symptoms, 12 had one and 9 had two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Experts have examined 48 files and classified 30 as definite and 18 as probable </plain></SENT>
