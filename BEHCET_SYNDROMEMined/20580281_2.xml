<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Biopsy specimens were obtained from patients with BD (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) (n = 11), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206139" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral lichen planus</z:e> (OLP) (n = 11) and healthy individuals (HI) (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight samples in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> groups were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups were analyzed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> streptavidin-aminoethylcarbazole using monoclonal mouse antibodies to HSP60 Ab-1 (clone LK1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunostaining indicative of HSP60 expression in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> were significantly higher than HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between BD and OLP except in the suprabasal layer of epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Altered expression of HSP60 was found in ulcerative lesions of BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> suggesting that HSP60 has an association with the etiology or chronicity of these inflammatory lesions </plain></SENT>
