<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels and PON1 levels were measured spectrophotometrically in 16 patients with BD in the active stage of the disease and in 15 healthy subjects who constituted the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the BD group, median (range) serum PON1 and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were 149.64 U/l (88.02-281.68) and 1.21 nmol/ml (0.90-3.42), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group, median (range) serum PON1 and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were 206.86 U/l (114.43-422.52) and 0.72 nmol/ml (0.50-1.12), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant decrease in serum PON1 levels (p = 0.02) and an increase in serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels (p&lt;0.001) in patients with BD in the active stage when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endothelial damage and increased polymorph nuclear leucocyte activity in the active stage of BD could result in a pro-oxidation environment which, in turn, results in decreased <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> PON activity and increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation as evidenced by increased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
