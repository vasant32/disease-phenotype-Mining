<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: to determine whether <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease affects haemostatic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University Hospital, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: one hundred and twenty-seven consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 34 of whom with a history of vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: prothrombin fragment 1+2 tissue plasminogen activator, protein S and C, antithrombin, fibrinogen, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor, thrombomodulin and prothrombin time (PT) were measured in patient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: soluble thrombomodulin was significantly lower and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with vascular involvement showed the highest levels of vWF and tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no activation of coagulation, not even in patients with an active disease at the time of sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: there were indirect signs of endothelial activity or damage, particularly in patients with vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coagulation was not activated </plain></SENT>
