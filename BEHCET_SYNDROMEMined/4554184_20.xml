<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The metabolism of human plasminogen labeled with radioactive <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> was studied in 12 healthy men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The labeled plasminogen had a high specific activity and the same elution on Sephadex G-100 as the plasminogen activity in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectrophoresis revealed a single precipitin line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">Polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis revealed six main bands, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with plasminogen properties and radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purified plasminogen behaved as a homogeneous protein in the turnover experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma radioactivity data were adequately approximated by a sum of two exponential terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The metabolism of plasminogen was therefore represented by a two-compartment mammillary model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results in the 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were as follows: plasma plasminogen concentration 20.8+/-1.9 mg/100 ml; intravascular plasminogen pool 0.66+/-0.14 g; intravascular fraction 0.59+/-0.06; fractional catabolic rate 0.55+/-0.09 of the plasma pool per day; half-life of the plasma radioactivity 2.21+/-0.29 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Circulating large-molecular-weight degradation products of labeled plasminogen could not be detected by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The plasminogen turnover rate was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome and low circulating plasminogen activator activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the concept that under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions the primary pathway of plasminogen catabolism is not via the formation of plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The in vivo effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi>, a potent inhibitor of plasminogen activation, on the turnover of labeled plasminogen was studied in five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When 1 g was administered perorally t.i.d. to three of them, one showed an increased plasminogen turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A 2 g dose administered t.i.d. to the other two caused markedly increased catabolism in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This increase may be attributable to a direct reversible effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">tranexamic acid</z:chebi> on the plasminogen molecule </plain></SENT>
