<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MS patients' sera were screened by a protein macroarray derived from human fetal brain cDNA library (hEX1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera of 90 consecutive relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients and age-matched 145 Behçet's disease (BD) patients, 40 infectious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> patients, and 70 healthy controls were screened by ELISA for serum antibodies against the selected clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sequencing of the clone with the highest signal intensity revealed switch-associated protein 70 (SWAP70) as a potential target autoantigen in RRMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ELISA studies showed high-titer SWAP70-antibodies in 21 (23.3 %) RRMS and 7 (4.8 %) BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SWAP70 antibodies were more likely to be found positive in sera obtained during or shortly after a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Detection of SWAP70 antibodies during the attack period might suggest that SWAP70 is involved in MS relapse pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether serum SWAP70 antibody detection may be utilized as an MS relapse predictor should be tested in prospective studies </plain></SENT>
