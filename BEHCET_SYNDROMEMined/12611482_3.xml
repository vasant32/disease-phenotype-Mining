<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level in patients diagnosed as having <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venous blood was taken from 27 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 21 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were measured using fluorescence polarization immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> levels were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> were not significantly different in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease when compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.17, p = 0.13, and p = 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this study confirmed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were not elevated in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease when compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies in a subset of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are needed to determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> in the thrombotic form of the disease </plain></SENT>
