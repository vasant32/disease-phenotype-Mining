<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to retrospectively assess the prevalence of neurological involvement and the clinical patterns of presentation in a monocentric cohort of patients with BD, who have been followed in the last twenty years at our centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and seventeen patients were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The male/female ratio was 1.6:1, with a mean disease duration of 11±5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 42±9 years (min:18, max:77), while the mean age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 25±4 years (min:10, max:58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean ± SD duration of follow-up at our centre was 7±2 (min:1, max:11) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological involvement was observed in 38% (44 patients, 36 males and 8 females; mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 25±4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Organic brain involvement, demonstrated by MRI was due to ischaemic pons-mesencephalon lesions in 19 patients and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> with brainstem involvement in 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement was confirmed by electroneuromyographic study in 4 patients, and consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> prominent in the lower extremities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases; we have also observed only 2 cases of endocranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 3 BD patients suffering from pulsatile, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, without abnormal neurological examination, responding only to medium-high doses of steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement (total prevalence: 32% of the cohort) was observed in 2 patients within the first year from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BD, in 4 cases between the first and the third year, in 24 between the third and the fifth year, 7 between the fifth and the tenth year; none presented a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement after the first 10 years of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuro-BD is more frequent in young males and it never represents a presenting feature of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequent time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological involvement seems to be within the first 10 years of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since neurological involvement may result in severe functional disability or be a life-threatening disease, a careful follow-up during the first years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is recommended </plain></SENT>
