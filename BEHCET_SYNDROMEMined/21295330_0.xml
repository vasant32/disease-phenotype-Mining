<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While most patients respond to standard immunosuppressive therapies, a subset will develop refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, the use of a novel therapy for the treatment of BD is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients with severe refractory BD who were treated with nonmyeloablative high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy without stem cell rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment, both patients were completely weaned off immunosuppressive therapy and entered disease-free remissions of 18 and 24 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy without stem cell rescue as an alternative for the treatment of refractory BD </plain></SENT>
