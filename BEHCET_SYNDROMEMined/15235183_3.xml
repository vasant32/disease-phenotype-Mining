<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since its first description, the involvement of many organ-systems has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the involvement of the peripheric <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system has not been well documented yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients involved in the study were without prominent complaints of neuropathic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were surveyed through the outpatient clinic of the department of dermatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient filled out a total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> score (TNS) questionnaire after their neurologic exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A neurology specialist conducted the electrophysiological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results were noteworthy because this complication was present without significant complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the nerve dysfunction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> of BD is an axonal type of distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> and predominantly involves the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not find a predominant motor or sensory nerve involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This complication is mentioned and reported rarely in BD </plain></SENT>
