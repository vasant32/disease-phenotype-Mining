<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been some evidence that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) has a significant autoimmune component but the molecular identity of putative autoantigens has not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the initial analysis of the autoantibody profile in 39 Chinese BD patients, autoantibodies to cellular proteins were uncovered in 23% as determined by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now identified one of the major autoantibody specificities using expression cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum from a BD patient was used as a probe to immunoscreen a lambdaZAP expression cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Candidate autoantigen cDNAs were characterized by direct nucleotide sequencing and their expressed products were examined for reactivity to the entire panel of BD sera using immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactivity was also examined with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control sera and disease control sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six independent candidate clones were isolated from the cDNA library screen and were identified as overlapping partial human kinectin cDNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding that kinectin was an autoantigen was verified in 9 out of 39 (23%) BD patient sera by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sera from controls showed no reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of kinectin as a participant in autoimmune pathogenesis in BD and the potential use of autoantibody to kinectin in serodiagnostics are discussed </plain></SENT>
