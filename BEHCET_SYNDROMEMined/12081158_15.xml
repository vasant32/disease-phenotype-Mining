<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients diagnosed according to the International Study Group criteria as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly allocated to receive either dapsone 100 mg daily or placebo for three months in a double-blind manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After three months, patients were crossed over and followed for a further three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up in each visit by assessing the number, size, duration and frequency of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, other cutaneous manifestations, and systemic manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test was done on each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, white blood cell count, ESR, and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In dapsone-treated patients, there were significant reductions in the oral and genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> parameters as well as the incidence of other cutanous and systemic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the placebo-treated group, there were no significant changes in these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test result as well as those of other laboratory tests were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased in the dapsone-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although this study was a small scale study, it shows that dapsone was effective in treatment of mucocutaneous manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and possibly in prophylaxis against systemic manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This result should lead to a larger scale study with a longer duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
