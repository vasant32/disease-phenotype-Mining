<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There have been some studies on the burden of certain rheumatological disorders on the tendons; however, patients with familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) have not, up to now, been studied in this regard in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, this current study centers on ensuing changes in the tendons of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study comprised 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> (13 male, 19 female), 31 with BD (18 male, 13 female) and 35 control subjects (17 male, 18 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sonographical evaluations were performed from the triceps, quadriceps and Achilles tendons on the non-dominant extremities of the individuals using a linear array probe of 8-16 MHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean triceps tendon (TT) thickness value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients was greater than that of BD patients (P=0.03) or the controls' (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean quadriceps tendon (QT) thickness value of BD patients was greater than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients (P=0.00) or the controls' (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean Achilles tendon (AT) thickness value of BD patients was greater than that of controls' (P=0.05) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was not any difference between the tendon thickness measurements of either group of patients with and without arthritic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our first and preliminary findings pertaining to increased tendon thicknesses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> (TT) and BD (QT and AT) patients should be complemented with future histological and clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The functional relevance of tendon thickening, its probable reflection on the rupture risk and the role of each disease related contributing factor remain to be uncovered </plain></SENT>
