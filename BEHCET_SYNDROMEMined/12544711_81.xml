<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We surveyed the 20-year outcome of a cohort of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome with emphasis on both mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During 1999 and 2000, we collected outcome information on 387/428 (90.4%) of a cohort of patients (262 male, 125 female) who had registered in a dedicated outpatient clinic between July 1977 and December 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 245/345 (71.0%) patients, outcome information was based on a formal hospital reevaluation, and in the remaining patients, on detailed telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (9.8%) (39 male, 3 female) had died, mainly due to major vessel disease and neurologic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality, as measured by standardized mortality ratios (SMR), was specifically increased among young males, among whom morbidity was also the highest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the SMR tended to decrease significantly with the passage of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same was also true for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mucocutaneous and articular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> and its greatest damage were also usually within the first few years of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These suggest that the "disease burden" of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome is usually confined to the early years of its course, and in many patients the syndrome "burns out." However, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement and major vessel disease are exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They can have their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> late (5-10 yr) during the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As reflected in the mortality figures, the disease was less severe among the females for almost each disease manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no female patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001141'>Severely impaired vision</z:hpo> did not always mean an eventual loss of useful vision, and those patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> had a better visual prognosis </plain></SENT>
