<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This form of the disease, called as neurobehcet's disease (NB), can be misdiagnosed as multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating disorder</z:e> of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, so their differential diagnosis is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, to identify the parameters of electrophysiological testing that might be useful in their differential diagnosis, we performed evoked potentials (EPs) and electroneuromyography (ENMG) on patients with MS and NB, and on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 95 persons, 55 MS patients, 20 NB patients and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers between ages 31 and 55, were studied electrophysiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual evoked potential (VEP), brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP), posterior tibial somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and nerve conduction and needle electromyography studies were performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters of EPs were compared among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of the BAEP and SEP studies did not show statistically significant difference between NB and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the VEP study indicated that the amplitude values of cortical VEP potentials (P100) in the NB and MS groups were lower than those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (p &lt; 0.01), and that the amplitudes in the NB group were lower than for the MS group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, P100 amplitude measured from peak to peak seems to be more reliable and thus should be used in the differential diagnosis of MS and NB </plain></SENT>
