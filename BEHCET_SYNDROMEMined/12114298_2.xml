<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Structural brain examinations, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, may be useful in diagnosing and following-up these cerebral syndromes in some cases, but they are more often inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) with perfusion tracers is a powerful method that can disclose brain involvement in many clinical situations, even in patients with subtle neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, perfusion tracers can disclose regional hypoperfusion caused by both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to vascular narrowing and neuronal metabolic derangement due to direct neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter phenomenon occurs because the blood flow to the brain is strictly regulated by metabolic demands, so that hypometabolism is reflected by hypoperfusion in most instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPECT findings in 42 mainly neurologically asymptomatic patients with SSc and in eight mainly neurologically symptomatic patients with BD are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPECT was shown to be very sensitive and disclosed brain functional deficits in approximately half of SSc patients without neurological complaints and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with BD, who had various neurological symptoms but usually inconclusive structural brain examinations </plain></SENT>
