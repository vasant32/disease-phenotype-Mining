<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To demonstrate the effect of bevacizumab compared with triamcinolone acetonide for the treatment of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> in noninfectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 31 eyes of 31 patients with uveitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> that had persisted despite conventional treatment were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten eyes received 1.25 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab (<z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp>), 11 eyes received 4 mg of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA), and 10 eyes received 40 mg of posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide (PSTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in visual acuity with a logarithmic minimal angle of resolution and central foveal thickness measured with optical coherence tomography were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 22.3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best improvement in visual acuity and reduction in central foveal thickness was achieved at 4 weeks in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups but worsened with time until 12 weeks (visual acuity improved from baseline by 0.19, 0.27, and 0.16 and central foveal thickness decreased from baseline by 167.4 mm, 327.6 mm, and 166.4 mm with <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp>,IVTA, and PSTA, respectively; P , 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results with IVTA were better than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> or PSTA, although the difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravitreal bevacizumab provided a significantly better effect in visual acuity gain in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> than in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis showed that the median period of effect were 16 weeks with <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp>, 30 weeks with IVTA, and 12 weeks with PSTA.An increase in intraocular pressure (.5 mmHg greater than baseline) was observed in 1 eye(10%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp>, 5 eyes (45.5%) with IVTA, and 4 eyes (40%) with PSTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravitreal bevacizumab was a well-tolerated and effective supplementary therapy for persistent uveitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo>, especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and for patients with the risk of an increase in intraocular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, reinjection may be required because of the limited potency and duration of the positive effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
