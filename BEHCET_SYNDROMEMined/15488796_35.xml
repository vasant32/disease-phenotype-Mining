<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody infliximab in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients without clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> and impaired visual acuity because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> (CME) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with refractory CME (14 eyes, mean duration of 14 months), associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adamantiades-Behcet disease</z:e> (n = 2), adult-type vascular pseudotumor (n = 1), and HLAB27+-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (n = 1) received an intravenous infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg); five patients were retreated after 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macular thickness, measured by ocular coherence tomography, was reduced from 428 +/- 138 microm to 219 +/- 51 microm at 2 months postbaseline (P = .0001), while visual acuity increased from 0.41 +/- 0.18 to 0.83 +/- 0.17 (P &lt; .00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anatomic and functional improvement was sustained at 6 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No ocular or extra-ocular side effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These promising results suggest that TNF may play an important pathogenetic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> CME, thus, a controlled trial is warranted </plain></SENT>
