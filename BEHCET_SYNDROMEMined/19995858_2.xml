<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-six men with BS, who had only active mucocutaneous manifestations when entering a controlled trial of thalidomide mean (s.d.) 11.7 (0.8) years ago, were re-evaluated for the use of immunosuppressives as an indication of major organ involvement during the post-trial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcome information was obtained in 91 (95%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine (43%) patients had to use immunosuppressives during the post-trial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive use was significantly more frequent among patients developing BS at younger age (76%; &lt;or=24 years) than older age (30%; &gt;or=25 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Developing BS at young age (OR = 6.3; 95% CI 2.09, 19.04) and not using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> during the post-trial period (OR = 3.860; 95% CI 1.484, 10.034) were risk factors for immunosuppressive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 82% of the patients using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> during old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> showed a significant effect in decreasing the use of immunosuppressives only among patients of old age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (Fisher's exact test = 5.026; P = 0.031) in the subgroup analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Eye disease</z:e> (18 patients) and vascular involvement (14 patients) were the most frequent indications for immunosuppressive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Being free of major organ involvement during the early years of BS does not indicate a mild prognosis for men developing BS at young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> will reduce the need for immunosuppressive use among men developing BS at old age awaits formal studies </plain></SENT>
