<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the interobserver and intra-observer reliability of the Turkish version of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF), which was obtained by a translation and back-translation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (BS) patients were assessed by four rheumatologists in separate morning and afternoon sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed good intra- and interobserver agreement for the <z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and eye involvement of BS, but there was poor agreement between (kappa score = 0.14) and within observers (range for kappa scores 0.09-0.25) for their overall impression of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual low kappa scores were also noted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, vascular involvement, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement and gastrointestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the Turkish version of BDCAF may be useful for assessing the classic triad of BS (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> and eye involvement), but more experience is needed for its other parts </plain></SENT>
