<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> of young adults characterized by venous occlusion in both the deep venous and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In severe ocular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> may occur despite immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common inherited risk factor for the development of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is the presence of the Factor V (FV Leiden) mutation, which confers resistance to activated protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of FV Leiden with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease has been reported, but its influence on ocular disease is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the prevalence of this mutation in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease to determine its contribution to the presence and severity of ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and six Middle Eastern patients satisfying international criteria, and 120 healthy control subjects without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were included in the study, and patients underwent standard examination by two ophthalmologists with an interest in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and screened for the FV Leiden mutation with the polymerase chain reaction method with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FV Leiden was detected in 19% (23/120) of the control population compared with 27% (29/106) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (P = .13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who had ocular disease (75/106), the prevalence of FV Leiden was significantly higher (32%) than it was in control subjects (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ocular patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease in whom <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> occlusive disease was observed (25/75) had the highest expression of FV Leiden (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that FV Leiden may be an additional risk factor for the development of ocular disease and, in particular, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vaso-occlusion, and it may contribute to the poor visual outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
