<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well known that CD4(+) CD25(+) T-regulatory (Treg) cells prevent harmful immune responses to self- and non-self-antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the role of Treg cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV)-induced BD-like symptoms was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HSV type 1 (F strain) inoculation of the earlobe of ICR mice has been shown to induce the development of BD-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the effect of Treg was associated with change in BD-like symptoms, CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells from the splenocytes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice were adoptively transferred intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treg cells of splenocytes were significantly elevated following the transfer of 3 Ã— 10(5) CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells to BD-like mice compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The transfer of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells to BD mice improved the symptoms, and the serum protein levels of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6 and IL-17 were significantly altered compared with the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of anti-CD25 antibody to BD mice reduced the frequency of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells and increased the BD severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the influence of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells on BD-like mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that up-regulation of the CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells in BD-like mice improves the inflammatory symptoms, while down-regulation of CD25(+) T cells is associated with deteriorated symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these findings are correlated with changes in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels </plain></SENT>
