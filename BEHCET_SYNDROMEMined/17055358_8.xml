<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pivotal mediator of Th1 cytokine response, have been reported to be upregulated in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the distribution of IL-18 promoter -607 C/A and -137 G/C polymorphisms in 103 BD patients (mean age 41.0 years; 48 male, 55 female) using allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared with healthy control subjects, BD patients had a significantly higher frequency of the -607 CC genotype (42.7% vs 23.3%, odds ratio [OR] = 2.455, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.350-4.461, p(c) = 0.021) and a higher frequency of the -607 C allele (60.7% vs 48.1%, OR = 1.668, 95% CI = 1.129-2.464, p = 0.0101) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis showed that BD patients had significantly less -607A/-137G haplotype (27.3% vs 44.2%, OR = 0.469, 95% CI = 0.268-0.820, p(c) = 0.032) and -607A/-137G haplotype homozygote (5.8% vs 20.4%, OR = 0.242, 95% CI = 0.096-0.612, p(c) = 0.014) than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of -607C/-137G haplotype homozygote was significantly higher in BD patients than control subjects (48.5% vs 20.4%, OR = 3.684, 95% CI = 1.997-6.791, p(c) = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there were no associations between the polymorphisms and clinical manifestations or severity, patients with the -607 CC genotype or -607C/-137G haplotype homozygote showed significantly earlier symptom development (p = 0.034 by ANOVA; p = 0.009 by t-test, respectively) than those with other genotypes or diplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the IL-18 promoter gene is a candidate susceptibility gene in BD patients </plain></SENT>
