<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 5 cases, histologic examination of intestinal biopsy specimens showed lymphatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the small intestine which were considered to be a characteristic finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002593'>intestinal lymphangiectasia</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002243'>protein-losing enteropathy</z:hpo>, but no patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease showed reduced concentration of serum total protein as well as abnormal value of 131I-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphograms showed an increase in number of iliopelvic and lumbar lymphatic vessels as a major finding, but they failed to demonstrate a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of lymphatic system or obstruction of thoracic duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that the lymphatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the small intestine in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be related to increased flow of lymph due to excessive vascular hyperpermeability and may not be related to a block of lymphatic system which has been considered to be a cause of enteric protein loss in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002593'>intestinal lymphangiectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors wish to emphasize that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of lymphatic vessel of the small intestine is not a sufficient finding to indicate the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002243'>protein-losing enteropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
