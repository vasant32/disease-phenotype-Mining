<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine the true frequency and anatomic location of the PPL and compare this with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also sought to determine whether or not there was any relationship between PPL and either disease activity or other manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with BD, diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e>, were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 100 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatologic diseases</z:e> (21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> and 79 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> patients), selected randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dermatologist counted the lesions, in a blind protocol, on seven anatomic locations: scalp, face, neck, trunk, upper and lower extremities and genitalia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of PPL in patients with BD was 96% and the most common location was the trunk, whereas in the control group the frequency was 89% and the most common location was the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> patients, the frequency was 100% and 86.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total mean number, and mean numbers of PPL on the location of trunk, upper and lower extremities, and genitalia were higher in patients with BD than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the PPL in BD patients with a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test was compared with that in patients with a negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test, the difference was significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PPL appear to be non-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the diagnosis of BD the mean number and anatomic location of the lesions are of more importance than the frequency </plain></SENT>
