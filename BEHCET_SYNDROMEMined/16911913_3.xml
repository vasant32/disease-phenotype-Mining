<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether aortic distensibility and arterial wave reflections are linked to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in ABD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-two patients and 40 controls with similar atherosclerotic risk factors were examined by applanation tonometry of the radial artery (SphygmoCor) and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Augmentation index (AI%) and arrival time (Deltat, ms) of reflected arterial waves as well as aortic distensibility (AoD) assessed by echocardiography were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler diastolic abnormalities were defined as proposed by the European Study Group on Diastolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> by measurement of E/A ratio, isovolumic relaxation time, deceleration time, and flow propagation velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had impaired central augmentation index (CAI), Deltat, and AoD compared with controls (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, atherosclerotic risk factors, left ventricular mass, and medication the odds-ratio of AoD and CAI for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> was 0.664 (95%CI 0.449-0.982), P = .04, and 1.073 (95% CI 1.014-1.140), P = .001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of CAI to the multivariable model including AoD significantly increased the power of the model for prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> (-2 Log likelihood change = 18.8, P for change &gt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Augmentation index has a complementary value to aortic distensibility in the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> in ABD </plain></SENT>
