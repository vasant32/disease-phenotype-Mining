<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 22 consecutive BD patients with refractory uveoretinitis treated with infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients dropped out from the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 19 patients received the therapy for 6 months or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy was evaluated by the ocular attacks and best corrected visual acuity at remission in the 19 patients and the safety was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of ocular attacks in the 6 months before and after the infliximab therapy were 3.0+/-2.6 and 0.4+/-1.1, respectively (p&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was very effective in 7 patients where no ocular attacks occurred throughout infliximab therapy, effective in 10 patients where ocular attacks was reduced, and non-effective in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vision was either improved or unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes at the 6th months therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Various adverse effects were seen in 14 patients, but non were serious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infiximab therapy is effective in managing the refractory uveoretinitis in BD, but elucidation of the safety needs more patients and a longer follow-up period </plain></SENT>
