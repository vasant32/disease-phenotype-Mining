<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results have confirmed the light microscopical qualitative findings of a large number of lymphocytes (67%) but have established that a relatively large proportion of the leukocytes (14%( belong to the monocyte-macrophage series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The virtual absence of plasma cells during the early stages of ulceration and the presence of a large number of lymphocytes and monocytes argue in favour of a type IV cell-mediated immune reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the lesion progresses a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0301918" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">type III reaction</z:e> develops and this might be associated with immune complexes found in the serum of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
