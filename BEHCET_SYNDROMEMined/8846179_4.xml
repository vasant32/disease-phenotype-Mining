<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University Hospital, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty nine patients with BD diagnosed and treated in our hospital during the last 10 years were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients with 54 vascular lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of isolated venous lesions in BD was 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Venous lesions developed after the initial diagnosis of BD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients within 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (63%) of the 54 vascular lesions were venous and 15 (28%) were arterial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 5 (9%) patients, both arterial and venous lesions were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>Deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was the most frequent lesion (76%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (10%), superior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (10%) and inferior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (2%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Venous lesions are not rare and affect the prognosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For this reason, venous lesions of BD should always be sought at follow-up of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
