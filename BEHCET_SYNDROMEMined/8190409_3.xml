<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study consisted of 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and five control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 25 eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 25 eyes, 10 were in a state of remission, and the other 15 were in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was performed by administering 370 MBq (10 mCi) 99Tcm-GH intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Planar images were acquired 6 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eye/scalp indices were quantified by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) around each eye and normalizing the mean counts per pixel by the mean counts in the scalp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean eye/scalp indices were 1.87 +/- 0.19 in controls and 1.98 +/- 0.19 in the affected eyes that were in remission (P = 0.23, nonsignificant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the illness, the mean eye/scalp index was 2.18 +/- 0.28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between controls and the eyes that were in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the illness was significant (one way analysis of variance, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean value of the index for affected eyes in remission was not significantly different to that for eyes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (P = 0.068, nonsignificant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings suggest that, despite previously published reports in animals with experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, 99Tcm-GH scintigraphy may not be a very sensitive method for evaluating human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
