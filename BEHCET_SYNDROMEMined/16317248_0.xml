<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to ascertain whether erythrocyte aggregation (EA) may be involved in thrombotic events and or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD patients, we determined using two erythrocyte aggregometers i.e. Myrenne and Sefam (which provides the total disaggregation threshold, needed for erythrocytes to disaggregate), EA in 77 BD patients (42 male, 35 female, aged 44 +/- 12 years) and 77 controls (41 male, 36 female, aged 43 +/- 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BD patients showed higher EA determined with both aggregometers: Myrenne (EA(0): P = 0.035; EA(1): P &lt; 0.001) or the Sefam (Ta: P &lt; 0.001, AI(10): P &lt; 0.001, gammaD: P = 0.014) as well as higher fibrinogen and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.003, respectively) compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However no differences were observed in any of the aggregation parameters determined either with the Myrenne (EA(0), EA(1)) or the Sefam (Ta, AI(10), gammaD) aggregometer when BD patients with thrombotic events (n = 23) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (n = 21) were compared with those who did not (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results reinforce previous findings of our group, suggesting that EA does not seem to be involved in thrombotic events or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
