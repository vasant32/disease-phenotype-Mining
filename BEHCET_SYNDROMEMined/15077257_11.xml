<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and type of vascular lesions and to study the association of factor V gene G1691A (Leiden) and prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in Italian patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Included were 118 consecutive Italian BD patients followed over a 3-year period (1997-1999) who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 132 healthy Italian blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BD patients and controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific restriction enzyme techniques for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Vascular lesions were observed in 37 (31.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2 most common lesions were subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (10.2%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) of the legs (22.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant demographic and clinical differences between patients with and without DVT were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of prothrombin gene G20210A and factor V Leiden polymorphisms did not differ significantly between BD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of carriage rates of prothrombin gene G20210A and factor V Leiden polymorphisms in BD patients with and without DVT were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of 20210A allele was significantly higher in BD patients with ocular disease than in those without, particularly in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>/<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency and types of vascular lesions in Italian BD patients were similar to those reported in studies from other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and G20210A mutation in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene with DVT was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, a prothrombin gene G20210A mutation may influence the development and severity of ocular involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
