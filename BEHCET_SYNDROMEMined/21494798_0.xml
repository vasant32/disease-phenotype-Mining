<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were enrolled to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the patients were inactive, and 39 of them were active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 30 healthy subjects as being control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visfatin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-α) levels were measured with ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visfatin levels were significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> whose illnesses were active or inactive than the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the active patient and inactive patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reason for the lower levels of serum visfatin in active and inactive patients' group could be due to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 which suppress genetic expression of visfatin in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, or else </plain></SENT>
