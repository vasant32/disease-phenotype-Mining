<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A similar enhancement of blast formation in the mixed lymphocyte culture was also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High concentrations of the drug led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of both of these responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations led to studies in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> model in which immunopotentiation was demonstrated in vivo, and this effect was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As in the human in vitro studies, high doses of the drug were not associated with augmentation of the immune response and in this circumstance no inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assuming that potentiation of immune responsiveness is of benefit to patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome, the development of clinical trials employing levamisole appears justified, as long as the drug dosage is carefully monitored </plain></SENT>
