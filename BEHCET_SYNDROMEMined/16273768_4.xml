<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) are found in 50-60% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels have been reported in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reassessed the level of IgG and IgA ASCA antibodies in BS and in a group of diseased and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-five patients with BS were studied along with 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS), 24 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), 25 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 21 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A commercial ELISA kit was used (Inova Diagnostics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was only the patients with CD who had significantly higher levels of antibodies compared with the rest of the group (ANOVA: ASCA IgG, p = 0.0001; ASCA IgA, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>42% of CD, 4% of BS, 4% of UC and 15% of AS patients had a positive IgG+IgA ASCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant trend for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) involvement with BS (n = 8) to be more positive for IgG and IgG+IgA ASCA compared to the rest of the patients with BS (n = 77) (Chi-square, IgG, p = 0.02, IgG+IgA, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rate of positivity of ASCA in BS is comparable to that observed among patients with UC and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with BS who have GI involvement may have higher levels of ASCA and this needs to be further studied </plain></SENT>
