<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The assessment of disease activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), either by BD Current Activity Form (BDCAF) or Iranian BD Dynamic Measure (IBDDAM), depends largely on the history of the clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of recall of a retrospective questionnaire might influence its reliability to some extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with BD can recall the items included in both of the disease activity forms accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with BD completed a retrospective questionnaire that included BDCAF and IBDDAM, twice, 1 month apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We made some modifications in the IBDDAM, while the BDCAF (revised 8.5.2002, GL) was applied in its original structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the original application of IBDDAM, in which the history obtained depends on the variable time period, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> items of IBDDAM in the present study asked subjects to report their symptoms over the preceding 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, those IBDDAM items for which the operational definitions are not clearly provided by the developers, as well as the items that depend on the objective examination rather than the history, were not included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concurrent daily data were collected for 2 months via telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of agreement between the retrospective responses and those extracted from daily recordings were quantified for each item using intraclass correlation coefficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the recalled and daily reports was good (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>&gt;0.60) for the majority of items (oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and eye involvement) included in BDCAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exceptions were gastrointestinal symptoms (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>&lt;0.40) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> 0.40-0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With regard to the IBDDAM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the items examined had good agreement (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>&gt;0.60), except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, for which the agreement was moderate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e> 0.40-0.50) for the first and poor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>&lt;0.40) for the second month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For most of the BD-related features questioned in the disease activity forms, patients provided reasonably accurate reports in comparison to information obtained from daily records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, it should be kept in mind that the limitations of the study design need to be considered while interpreting the results of the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Notably, unlike its original application in which the assessment depends on the variable time period, IBDDAM used in the present study assessed the symptoms present during the month prior to the date of assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our findings regarding IBDDAM cannot be applied to its original use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lack of patients in some of the symptom groups, as well as possible manipulation of recall with daily questioning, might have influenced our results to some extent </plain></SENT>
