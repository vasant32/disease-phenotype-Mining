<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the reduction of T cell receptor (TCR) AV24+,BV11+ CD4-,CD8- (double-negative [DN]) natural killer T (NKT) cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> (SS) to analyze why NKT cells are selectively reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, and to examine whether nonresponse to alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) is due to an abnormality in the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or NKT cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood from patients with RA (n = 20), SLE (n = 18), SSc (n = 13), and SS (n = 17), as well as from healthy donors (n = 13) and patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD; n = 20), was examined by flow cytometry to determine the number of TCR AV24+,BV11+ DN T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBLs from 10 RA, 10 SLE, 8 SSc, and 9 SS patients, as well as from 7 healthy subjects, were cultured in vitro with alpha-GalCer, and the number of TCR AV24+,BV11+ DN NKT cells was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APCs from responder and nonresponder patients were cocultured with NKT cells from responder and nonresponder patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> number of TCR AV24+,BV11+ DN NKT cells per ml of whole blood was found to be 48.8+/-10.0 in RA patients, 50.6+/-12.9 in SLE patients, 80.8+/-30.6 in SSc patients, and 40.0+/-11.7 in SS patients, while 290.0+/-69.6 and 321.2+/-103.4 NKT cells were present in healthy subjects and BD patients, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of 10 RA patients, 5 of 10 SLE patients, 4 of 8 SSc patients, and 6 of 9 SS patients (a total of 18 of 37 patients, or 48.6%) responded to alpha-GalCer, indicating that patients could be divided into two groups: alpha-GalCer responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, NKT cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthy subjects proliferated against alpha-GalCer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APCs from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonresponder patients were found to function as alpha-GalCer-presenting cells, while NKT cells from nonresponders did not expand even in the presence of APCs from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings strongly suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> can be divided into two groups (alpha-GalCer responders and nonresponders) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that the reduced numbers of NKT cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> may be due to an inadequate amount of alpha-GalCer-like natural ligands (i.e., adequate in only 48.6% of patients) for the induction of NKT cells in vivo, or to a dysfunction in the NKT cells themselves (in 51.4% of patients) </plain></SENT>
