<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six patients with complete type <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were studied electro-retinographically and electro-oculographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrical responses tested include the hyperosmolarity response in the EOG, the oscillatory potentials and the rapid off-response in the ERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The oscillatory potentials diminished in five eyes of four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one of these eyes the rapid off-response and the hyperosmolarity response were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hyperosmolarity response was suppressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> which suffered from severe diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001094'>iridocyclitis</z:hpo> accompanied with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020641" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypopyon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The a-wave, the b-wave, the oscillatory potentials and the rapid off-response were also abnormal in this eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hyperosmolarity response was abnormal in an eye with severe ocular lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, while the oscillatory potentials were frequently abnormal even in the earlier stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hyperosmolarity response originates in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The oscillatory potentials originate in the inner <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> take place in the inner <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layer in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
