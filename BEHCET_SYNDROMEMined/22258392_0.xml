<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide association study identified six microsatellite markers as disease susceptibility loci for Japanese patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To confirm our recent results, these microsatellite markers were examined in a Korean population as a replication study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study participants included 119 Behçet's disease patients and 141 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were enrolled in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association between the six reported microsatellite markers (D3S0186i, D6S0014i, D6S0032i, 536G12A, D12S0645i and D22S0104i) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-B was genotyped by sequence-based typing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A microsatellite marker located near the HLA-B region demonstrated significant association with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genotype and phenotype frequencies of the HLA-B*51 gene were significantly increased in patients (23.1 and 39.5%, respectively) compared with healthy controls (11.2 and 20.1%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microsatellite analysis revealed that the HLA-B*51 gene was strongly associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
