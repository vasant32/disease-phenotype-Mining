<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to report our experience in the surgical treatment of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 2001 through May 2004, 18 arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were diagnosed in 16 Behçet patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 24 to 52 years (mean, 37.4 +/- 5.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were six abdominal aortic, three common femoral, two iliac, two popliteal, two superficial femoral, and two anterior tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and one subclavian artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but four were in remission at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those 4 patients received immunosuppressive therapy before the surgical intervention to induce remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After hospital discharge, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were followed up regularly at 3-month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 17 +/- 4.2 months (range, 6-24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a successful surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the study period, we performed five aortic tube graft interpositions, two aortofemoral bypasses, one aortobifemoral bypass, three common femoral artery graft interpositions, and two femoropopliteal bypasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The popliteal artery (n = 2), anterior tibial artery (n = 2), and subclavian artery (n = 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were repaired primarily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> had to undergo reoperation because of postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The postoperative hospital stay was 8.5 +/- 4.3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, two false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the common femoral artery were repaired with a graft interposition procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Another patient who had undergone an aortic tube graft interposition was readmitted 9 months later with an external iliac artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The external iliac artery was ligated through a retroperitoneal approach, and femorofemoral bypass was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition, one femoropopliteal interposition graft was occluded, without disabling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although aneurysmal disease is rare in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, it can complicate the clinical picture and cause life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We believe that the establishment of remission before the surgical intervention decreases the incidence of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because recurrence at the site of anastomosis is possible, prolonged monitoring is required </plain></SENT>
