<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Using a genome-wide association scan and DNA pooling, we previously identified 5 novel genetic susceptibility loci for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to establish the genetic effect within the UBAC2 gene, in the course of which we replicated this genetic association and identified a functional variant within this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a total of 676 Behçet's disease patients and 1,096 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discovery set included 156 patients and 167 controls from Turkey, and the replication sets included 376 patients and 369 controls from Turkey and 144 patients and 560 controls from Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and around UBAC2 was performed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genetic association between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and UBAC2 was established, replicated, and confirmed (meta-analysis odds ratio 1.84, P = 1.69 × 10(-7) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis identified both a disease-risk haplotype and a protective haplotype (P = 0.00014 and P = 0.0075, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using conditional haplotype analysis, we identified the SNP rs7999348 (A/G) within UBAC2 as the most likely SNP with a genetic effect independent of the haplotypic effect formed by the remaining associated SNPs in this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we demonstrated that rs7999348 tags a functional variant associated with increased <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression of a UBAC2 transcript variant in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals homozygous for the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-associated "G" allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, our data suggested the possibility of multiple genetic effects that increase susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the UBAC2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We established and confirmed the genetic association between UBAC2 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in 3 independent sets of patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We identified the minor allele in rs7999348 as a disease-risk allele that tags altered UBAC2 expression </plain></SENT>
