<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the safety and to conduct a preliminary assessment of efficacy of intravitreal infliximab, an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor antibody, for sight-threatening relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single intravitreal injection of infliximab (1 mg/0.05 mL) was given to 15 patients with relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a unilateral attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Best-corrected visual acuity, anterior chamber cells, vitreous haze, and posterior eye segment <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were assessed at baseline and at 1, 7, 14, and 30 days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ocular or extra-ocular side effects were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline best-corrected visual acuity (mean logarithm of minimal angle of resolution, 0.74; range, 0.15 to 1.7) improved significantly by day 7 and continued to improve through day 30 after infliximab (mean, 0.30; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Profound decreases in anterior chamber cells and vitreous haze (both P &lt; .0001), as well as beneficial effects in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (P = .0001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> (P = .001) were evident through day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>Cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> persisted in 9 of 11 eyes affected, but central macular thickness decreased from a baseline mean of 434 to 309 mm at the end of follow-up (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lack of systemic treatment at baseline in 4 patients or background immunosuppressive medications, which remained unchanged during follow-up, did not influence significantly these responses; additional treatment was not required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that intraocularly produced or acting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor, or both, is crucial in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease-associated relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and that intravitreal infliximab should be considered when systemic administration is not feasible or contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies may identify patients for whom intravitreal infliximab is preferable to systemic treatment </plain></SENT>
