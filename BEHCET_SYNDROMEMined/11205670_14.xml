<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical records of 64 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, treated in our hospital during the last 4 years, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>37 patients underwent angiography or CT in the symptomatic regions because of symptoms or clinical signs of vascular involvement by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>33 (male:female ratio 28:5; mean age 35 years) of the 37 patients demonstrated vascular involvement, which was surgically proven (18 patients) or diagnosed on angiography (15 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiograms and CT images of these 33 patients were retrospectively analysed for lesion type, location, extent and other characteristic findings of vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>12 patients had only venous lesions, 11 had only arterial lesions and 10 had both arterial and venous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major angiographic findings of vascular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in deep veins of the lower extremities (19 patients), in the inferior vena cava (4 patients) and in the superior vena cava (2 patients), pseudoaneurysms of large or medium sized arteries (11 patients), and occlusions/ stenoses of distal run-off arteries (13 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common CT findings were obliterated deep veins (8 patients) and non-calcified thickened aneurysmal walls (9 patients), with or without contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of these angiographic and CT findings with clinical manifestations are helpful in distinguishing vascular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
