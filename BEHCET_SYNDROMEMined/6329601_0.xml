<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The collagenolytic activity of neutrophil was found to be significantly higher in patients during the attack phase of this disease than in patients during the remission phase, in patients with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collagenase was present in the collagenolytic enzyme, which showed high activity in the attack phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight of this enzyme was similar to that of mammalian neutrophil collagenase </plain></SENT>
