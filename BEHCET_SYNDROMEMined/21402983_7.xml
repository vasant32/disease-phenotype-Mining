<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose and dose-escalating therapy of interferon alfa-2a in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 37 patients with refractory <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> unresponsive to conventional immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Induction interferon alfa-2a therapy was given as a daily dose of 3.0 million IU (MIU) subcutaneously for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maintenance dose was achieved with 3.0 MIU 3 times per week given subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dosage was increased sequentially to 4.5, 6.0, and 9.0 MIU 3 times per week if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> relapses occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total therapy duration was 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measure was control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> with quiescence during maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ocular relapses per patient-year before and after initiation of interferon alfa-2a therapy and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-sparing effect were secondary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also estimated the rate of remission after discontinuing interferon alfa-2a therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During maintenance therapy, interferon alfa-2a controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in 35 patients (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients (41%), a maintenance dosage of 3.0 MIU 3 times per week controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> without any relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> relapses decreased from 3.52 per patient-year before to 0.75 per patient-year after initiating interferon alfa-2a therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were receiving systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> at the time of initiation of interferon therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the maintenance stage, 9 patients were able to discontinue and 8 to taper systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis estimated that the rate of remission after discontinuation of interferon alfa-2a therapy was 76% by 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The rate of remission remained stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A treatment protocol using a low-dose and dose-escalating therapy with interferon alfa-2a was able to control and achieve remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in most patients with refractory ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
