<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By means of video-densitometric image analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, we measured the buildup time (BT), time constant of washout rate (TC) and mean circulation time (MCT) for both the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery and vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: 1) The BT in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group was slightly prolonged compared to that in the control group, while the BT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Harada's disease</z:e> was shorter than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2) The TC in both the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's and Harada's groups was significantly prolonged compared to that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3) The MCT in both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's and Harada's groups was not significantly different from that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease cases may have normally and compensatory <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation, whatever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> occurs on <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:mp ids='MP_0001848'>choroiditis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Harada's disease</z:e> has no influence on <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation </plain></SENT>
