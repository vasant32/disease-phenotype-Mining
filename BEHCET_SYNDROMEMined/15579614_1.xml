<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A cross sectional study in which 17 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 13 healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups: those with and without end stage ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurotological status was evaluated with audiological tests (pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry, short increment sensitivity index, tone decay, and evoked response audiometry), and Dix-Halpike positional testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positional test was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The audiological test results of the patients with and without end stage ocular involvement were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sloping audiogram with bilateral symmetric and mild <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was the main audiogram obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the presence or absence of the end stage ocular involvement and the otological parameters studied excluding I-III interval on evoked response audiometry (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the main underlying pathogenetic factor in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is the autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurological and ocular damage may be different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the differential involvement of certain organ systems may not reflect the nature of the disease process itself, but rather the manner in which each organ responds to injury </plain></SENT>
