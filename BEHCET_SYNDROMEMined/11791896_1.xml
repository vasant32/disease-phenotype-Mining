<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to investigate the possible role of human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) polymorphism in susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-five patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease gave their written informed consent to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven point mutations (G191A, C282T, T341C, C481T, A803G, G590A, G857A) in the NAT2 gene were analysed using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, each patient received 100 mg dapsone orally to determine their NAT2 phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dapsone and its metabolite monoacetyl-dapsone were measured in 3-h plasma samples using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with an acetylation ratio (monoacetyl-dapsone/dapsone) less than 0.4 were defined as slow acetylators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 85 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 54 (63.5%) were identified as genotypically slow acetylators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 60% (51 of 85) of patients were diagnosed as slow acetylators according to monoacetyl-dapsone/dapsone ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, a low incidence of genotype/phenotype discrepancy (3.5%) was observed in Turkish patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When we compared our results with previous phenotyping and genotyping studies in the Turkish population, frequencies of slow and rapid acetylators were not statistically different in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the *5B allele was found to be slightly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than historic controls (44.7 vs 35.6%, P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of the overall genotypes and alleles of NAT2 between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of the NAT2*5B allele, responsible for slow acetylation, was slightly higher in patients than historic controls, our results failed to show an association between NAT2-acetylator status and risk for developing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
