<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of early surgery in patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the long-term clinical outcomes in patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease first diagnosed at surgery ("early surgery") compared with those requiring surgical resection during the course of the disease ("late surgery") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a single tertiary academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We reviewed the medical records of 272 consecutive patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease between March 1986 and August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cumulative probabilities of clinical recurrence and reoperation after operation were the main outcomes measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty of 272 patients were first diagnosed with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease at surgery (early surgery); the remaining 232 were diagnosed clinically, with 62 undergoing surgery during their follow-up after clinical diagnosis (late surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probabilities of postoperative clinical recurrence and reoperation were significantly lower in the early-surgery group than in the late-surgery group (p = 0.045 and p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, early surgery was the only independent factor significantly associated with a reduced probability of reoperation (HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.71; p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, when we analyzed only the patients who underwent surgery because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> symptoms, early surgery was not associated with lower cumulative clinical recurrence and reoperation rates (p = 0.896 and p = 0.492) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: We analyzed the clinical characteristics retrospectively, and the number of patients was insufficient to reach a decisive conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : According to the current study, the patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease undergoing early surgery showed better prognoses in comparison with those undergoing late surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early surgery may represent a valid approach in the initial management of the patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, at least in the subset of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
