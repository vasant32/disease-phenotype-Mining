<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BD is prevalent in the area of the Silk Route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that hsp are involved in the T cell activation in patients with BD in the UK, where this disease has developed sporadically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have thus examined whether the T cell response to the hsp-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> may be induced in patients with BD in Japan, an east pole of the Silk Route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As with patients in the UK, the human 60-kD hsp <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 336-351 also yielded vigorous proliferation of T cells in Japanese patients with BD, but neither in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects nor in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA); there was significant association between proliferation by this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and the presence of ocular lesion, but not any other symptoms of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> stimulates T cells as a polyclonal activator, a specific antigen or a superantigen-like substance, we analysed T cell receptor (TCR) usage of responding T cells by means of MoAbs specific for TCR Vbeta subfamily and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)-based technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that T cells with certain TCR Vbeta subfamilies (including Vbeta5.2-3, 8, 13.6, 18, 21.3) were increased in circulation and responded to the hsp <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in an antigen-specific fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, TCR Vbeta gene-amplified products of freshly isolated T cells of patients with BD formed several bands in the PCR-SSCP analysis; some of them became prominent after stimulation with the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that T cells in patients with this disease have already been expanded oligoclonally in vivo, which may be a result of stimulation by triggering antigens, including the hsp <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, hsp <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> stimulation induced proinflammatory cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including IL-8, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and TNF-beta in eight out of eight patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results suggest that hsp antigen may play a role in the pathogenesis of BD, not only in the area of the Silk Route, but also outside the Silk Route area </plain></SENT>
