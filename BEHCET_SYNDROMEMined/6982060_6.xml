<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of twenty-five patients with non-aphthous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e> and eight healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary cell lines obtained from oral mucosa by suction <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blistering</z:mp> and subsequent enzymatic dissociation were used as target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a modified 51chromium release macro-assay, a significant lytic effect due to antibody-independent lymphocytotoxicity could be demonstrated in patients with BD, but no significant lysis of target cells was found in the RAU patients compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results provide further evidence that antibody-independent lymphocytotoxicity may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> in BD </plain></SENT>
