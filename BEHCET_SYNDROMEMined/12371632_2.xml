<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether or not plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels play a part in vascular involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 74 consecutive BS patients fulfilling the criteria of the International Study Group for BS, 35 healthy control (HC) and 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BS patients were then classified as those with and without vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> concentrations were measured by enzyme immunoassay and chemiluminescent immunoassay methods respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were found to be higher in the BS patients than in the healthy control (16.08 +/- 7.5 vs. 12.9 +/- 6.3 micromol/L, p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels in the RA group on MTX were higher compared with both the BS and HC groups (28.7 +/- 9.9; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No remarkable difference pertaining to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels was found between BS patients with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> was also detected in 11 out of 22 (50%) of the patients with vascular involvement, which proved to be of no significant difference in comparison with those without vascular involvement (20/52, 38%; chi2 = 0.26, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Active BS smokers exhibited a higher concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> in contrast to non-smoker BS sufferers (20 +/- 8.4 vs 14.1 +/- 6.1 micromol/l; p &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Smoking was determined to have a positive correlation with vascular involvement (r = 0.26, p &lt; 0.046), as well as with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels (r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.012) in BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upon logistic regression analysis, smoking was found to have a significant relationship with vascular involvement (odds ratio 3.12 [95% CI 2.02-4.22] p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the study groups with respect to their <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> vitamin and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We were unable to make any correlation between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> in any of the groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and vascular involvement in our BS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We determined that smoking seems to pose a risk for vascular involvement in BS patients </plain></SENT>
