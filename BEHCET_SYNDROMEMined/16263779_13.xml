<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effect of depot <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> primarily for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and secondarily for the other mucocutaneous manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomized 86 patients who had active disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> to receive either intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> injections (40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6889">methylprednisolone acetate</z:chebi>) or placebo every 3 weeks for 27 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (88%) completed the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the mean number of genital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum lesions was less in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> group as a whole (P = 0.0046); subgroup analyses revealed that this was significant for females (P = 0.0148) but not for males (P = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-dose depot <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> did not have any beneficial effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it was useful in controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum lesions, especially among the females </plain></SENT>
