<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the increase in phagocytic cell activity by triggering oxidative reactions in various targets such as <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, proteins, and DNA leads to severe inflammatory and degenerative pathologies seen in BD In this study, oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status of patients with BD was evaluated in comparison with controls and in respect to disease activity by measuring serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate, vitamin A, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and total sulfhydryl levels (T-SH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and 8-OHdG levels (respectively 30.04 vs. 17.93 nmol/ml, P = 0.0004 and 1.60 vs. 1.03 ng/ml, P = 0.0019) and the decrease in T-SH levels of patients with BD in comparison with controls (0.69 vs. 0.76 mmol/l, P = 0.0085) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicate the impaired oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive correlation found between <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>/8-OHdG levels (P = 0.02), and the negative correlations both between T-SH/8-OHdG levels (P = 0.031) and T-SH/<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels (P = 0.009) show the concordance between the parameters evaluating oxidant-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the parameters used for evaluating oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status, serum 8-OHdG was the only one showing significantly higher levels in patients with clinically active disease in comparison (P = 0.004) to patients in inactive period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 8-OHdG that is assessed for the fist time in BD with this study can be proposed as a more reliable indicator of oxidant stress in evaluating disease activity </plain></SENT>
