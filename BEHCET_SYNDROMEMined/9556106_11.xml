<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A debate exists as to whether they are different from ordinary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has important clinical and pathophysiologic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathologic features of papulopustular lesions seen both in BS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> vulgaris (AV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Representative samples were obtained from 17 patients with BS and six patients with AV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detailed histopathologic features were evaluated by a dermatopathologist blinded to the diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering the epidermis, follicle epithelium, and dermis separately, no differences could be found between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The papulopustular lesions seen in these two disorders cannot be distinguished on the basis of clinical and histopathologic findings </plain></SENT>
