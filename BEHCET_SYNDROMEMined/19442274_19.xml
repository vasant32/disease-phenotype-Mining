<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we perform the first genome-wide association study in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using DNA pooling technology and the Affymetrix 500K arrays, we identified possible candidate gene associations with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in a cohort of 152 Behçet's disease patients and 172 healthy ethnically matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic loci that were identified in the pooling study were genotyped in patients and controls using TaqMan genotyping technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified genetic associations between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KIAA1529, CPVL, LOC100129342, UBASH3B, and UBAC2 (odds ratio = 2.04, 2.26, 1.84, 1.71, and 1.61, respectively; P value = 4.2 x 10-5, 1.0 x 10-4, 3.0 x 10-4, 1.5 x 10-3, and 5.8 x 10-3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the associated SNPs, the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-risk allele in rs2061634 leads to substitution of serine to cysteine at amino acid position 995 (S995C) in the KIAA1529 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using an unbiased whole-genome genetic association approach, we identified novel candidate genetic loci that are associated with increased susceptibility for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings will help to better understand the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
