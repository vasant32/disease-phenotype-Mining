<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cultured endothelial cells were incubated with neutrophils to assess tissue injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases of the complete type, in the active stage of the disease, OI production was markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other patients showed significantly higher OI and higher lysosomal enzyme levels than patients with other diseases (controls) receiving drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity tests showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release was also significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The destruction of desmosomes and cell deformation were demonstrated electron microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and catalase in the cell culture decreased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release to control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that neutrophils from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease generate high levels of OI, resulting in endothelial tissue damage </plain></SENT>
