<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease examined in our Department of Ophthalmology since 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included 140 patients (63 female and 77 male) with a mean follow-up of 6.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at the first manifestation was 23 years; full disease was noted at 32 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of eye involvement was 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were of Turkish (n=73) or German (n=34) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 56% patients developed eye involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine out of 76 HLA-B51-positive patients (64.5%) and 26 out of 60 HLA-B51-negative patients (43.3%; P=0.014) developed ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More than the half of the patients with Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease evaluated in our department developed ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significantly higher frequency of HLA-B51 in these patients </plain></SENT>
