<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease of whom 6 have had leg <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, some parameters of hemostasis or fibrinolysis have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet count, fibrinogen level, factor VIII coagulant activity, factor VIII antigen, plasminogen and antithrombin III level were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic capacity in response to venous occlusion of the arms was the same in patients and in healthy subjects, in the patients, there was no difference in regard to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These parameters seemed therefore not able to detect the thrombotic tendency in this disease </plain></SENT>
