<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsy specimens revealed typical features of membranous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in light microscopical, electron microscopical and immunofluorescent microscopical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating immune complexes (IC) phagocytized by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in this patient were significantly increased compared with those in healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrent oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> had persisted for 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> due to membranous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depositions of IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 were observed in the subcutaneous arteriolar walls by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and membranous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> might be due to a deposition of circulating immune complexes in various types of vascular vessels in this patient </plain></SENT>
