<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by 3 main symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001094'>iridocyclitis</z:hpo>, and oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>Nervous</z:mp> system involvement is seen rarely in this clinical entity and is known as neurological <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> usually occurs in the brain stem, cerebellum and medulla spinalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Voiding and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> can be due to progressive inflammatory reactions in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> and vascular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated the dysfunctional bladder and penis, and therapeutic options were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurological <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome after neurological evaluation were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological involvement and localization of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system were proved on evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Voiding and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> was evaluated regardless of the presence of related symptoms, and the results were compared with those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with voiding dysfunction on urodynamic study were treated and reevaluated symptomatically after 3 and urodynamically after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> in neurological <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome was 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mixed type vasculogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>impotence</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003834" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial insufficiency</z:e>, veno-occlusive dysfunction and neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>impotence</z:hpo> were identified in 7, 2, 2 and 1 patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Detrusor instability was demonstrated in 12 patients with urgency <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>, including 3 with detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Brain stem localization was determined in these patients on neurogenic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement was observed with anticholinergic treatment and clean intermittent catheterization in 3 patients with detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hypersensitive and hypocompliant detrusor was noted in patients with neurological <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> voiding habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Incontinence</z:e> or irritable bladder symptoms should not be considered innocuous clinical findings in neurological <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Lower urinary tract function should be evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with this neurological syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> is approximately 65% and the therapeutic approach should be determined according to lower urinary tract function </plain></SENT>
