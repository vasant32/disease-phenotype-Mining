<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients diagnosed according to the International Study Group criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients had mild-to-moderate disease and 16 patients had severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty matched control subjects were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a full history and examination from each subject, 10 mL blood was drawn from each for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum malondialdehyde, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, ceruloplasmin, copper and zinc levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> showed increased levels of serum malondialdehyde and copper while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and zinc levels were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between these parameters in patients with mild-to-moderate disease with those with severe disease showed only that serum zinc levels were lower in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum malondialdehyde levels were found to be significantly positively correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> size, duration and frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> levels were found to be inversely correlated with the clinical manifestation index and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Zinc levels were found to be inversely correlated with the clinical manifestation index and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test positivity grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Copper levels were found to be positively correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> did not show correlation with disease severity, they were correlated with the disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This points out the importance of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
