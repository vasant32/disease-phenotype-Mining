<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) patients and the potential link between <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymatic defences impairment and the disease duration, activity and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 40 BD patients (27 males, 13 females; mean age: 38.8 years) were prospectively enrolled in the study and compared to a sex and age matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), the reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH)/oxidised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSSG) ratio, erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, catalase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-PX) were analysed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A correlation analysis was performed between these parameters and disease duration, activity and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activity and severity of BD were assessed meaning two respective clinical scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When compared to controls <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> was increased and GSH/GSSG reduced in BD patients (respectively p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower while catalase was significantly higher in BD than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis showed that SOD activity was significantly and negatively correlated to disease duration and activity but not to severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> markers were not significantly linked to neither disease duration nor activity and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study confirm the existence of an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (OS) state in BD as shown by the increase of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and the diminution of GSH/GSSG ratio which can be used as another index of OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite this OS state, the activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and especially of SOD is impaired and negatively correlated to the disease duration and activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We think that a rational strengthening of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defences should be part of an optimal treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
