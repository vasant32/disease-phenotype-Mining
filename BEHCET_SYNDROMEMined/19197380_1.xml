<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Untreated 70 patients with BD and 33 healthy individuals were included into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were evaluated with respect to activity and specific individual clinical manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels were found significantly elevated in active BD when compared to inactive BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> levels were found to have high correlation with the number of active clinical manifestations increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was found between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and TNF-alpha levels, CRP, and ESR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> was found to be the best predictor of TNF-alpha among other parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> may involve in the pathogenesis of BD by inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
