<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> is now well established as an effective second-line drug to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In April 1995, the microemulsion-based formulation of cyclosporin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi>) was introduced based on its increased bioavailability at 'no extra cost' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There may have been concerns that with increased bioavailability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi>, some patients might experience increased toxicity, particularly if transferring from Sandimmun to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi> at the same dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience of 51 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi>--39 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, six with psoriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and the remainder with a variety of diseases, including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients continued their other medication including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five continued low dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (average 7.5 mg per day) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were monitored for safety and efficacy throughout their treatment according to standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients were enrolled in a study of efficacy and safety where the dose of cyclosporin was reduced to 2.5 mg/kg/day at the time of conversion, i.e. to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi> 2.5 mg/kg/day; 19 patients were converted dose for dose, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> dose range 2.5-4 mg/kg/day converted to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi> dose range 2.5-4 mg/kg/day and 27 patients started <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi> de novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cyclosporin is a useful disease modifying anti-rheumatic agent, and our experience suggests that the new formulation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi>, has a similar safety and efficacy profile to the original preparation (Sandimmun) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi> was relatively easy to manage and we noted a slight reduction in dose when compared to Sandimmun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With dose adjustments over 18 months the mean dose for patients with RA fell from 3.2 to 2.7 mg/kg/day and of the 27 patients starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Neoral</z:chebi> de novo only seven required an increased dose above 2.5 mg/kg/day in order to establish efficacy </plain></SENT>
