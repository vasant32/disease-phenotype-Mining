<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Tim-3-Tim-3L interaction serves as a specific down-regulator of the Th1 immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that Tim-3 expression is higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) mouse model, Tim-3 was expressed in a similarly high level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-9 in macrophages from BD-like mice was lower than in asymptomatic BD <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice; therefore, we injected 100 Î¼g of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-9 into BD-like mice five times at 3 day intervals and subsequently observed changes in symptoms over 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-9 improved the symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, decreased the severity score, and increased regulatory T cell expression in treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were lower in the <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-9-treated group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, Tim-3-Tim-3L interaction was found to influence inflammatory symptoms in BD-like mice </plain></SENT>
