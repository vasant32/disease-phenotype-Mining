<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We analysed the clinical vascular characteristics of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) patients in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of 412 patients who fulfilled the 1987 Japanese criteria for BD and were treated in two University hospitals from July 1991 to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> were excluded, since it is categorised as a skin manifestation according to the Japanese criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (6%) had large-vessel involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean ages at BD diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vascular episodes were 39.7 and 41.6 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Males predominated (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial and venous lesions were found in 8 (31%) and 21 patients (81%), respectively, including 3 (12%) with both types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was the most common arterial lesion (n=5, 19%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (n=2, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was the leading venous lesion (n=20, 77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>) occurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal involvement was more frequent than in patients without vascular involvement (p&lt;0.001); ocular involvement was less frequent (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients (12%) required surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, including infliximab, for vascular and/or concurrent gastrointestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine patients received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient died during the observation period, 4 days after surgery for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of vascular involvement in BD in Japan is lower than in other ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although one patient died during the observation, there was no fatal haemoptysis, even in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
