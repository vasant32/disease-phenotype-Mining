<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the EULAR/ESCISIT initiative was to develop evidence-based recommendations for the management of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), supplemented where necessary by expert opinions and taking already published data into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current article briefly summarises the results in German and comments on them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The multidisciplinary expert committee consisted of nine rheumatologists, three ophthalmologists, one internist, one dermatologist, and one neurologist, representing six European countries, Tunisia and Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient representative was also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Problem areas and related keywords for a systematic literature search were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature research was performed using MedLine and the Cochrane library up to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, 40 initial statements were generated based on the literature research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These yielded the final recommendations which resulted from two blind Delphi rounds of voting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine recommendations were developed for the management of different aspects of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strength of each recommendation was determined by the level of evidence and the expert's opinions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of agreement for each recommendation was determined using a visual analogue scale for both the whole committee and for each individual viewpoint of the subgroup, who considered themselves experts in that field of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was excellent concordance between the level of agreement of the whole group and the "experts in the field" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recommendations relating to eye, skin, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e>, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> are mainly evidence-based, while recommendations on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and neurological and gastrointestinal involvement are based largely on expert opinions and uncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The need for further properly designed controlled clinical trials is apparent </plain></SENT>
