<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chemokines are a family of chemoattractants of leukocytes that play a critical role for leukocyte recruitment in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of chemokines, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) in the peripheral blood, with a special reference to disease activities of the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of totally 55 patients with BD who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> (20 patients with active BD, 35 patients with inactive BD) as well as 19 healthy volunteers as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was defined according to the existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-8 and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 concentration levels in the plasma and whole-blood samples were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole-blood samples were obtained by lysing cell membranes of peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the plasma IL-8 samples were below the detectable limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whole-blood IL-8 levels were readily measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels in the patients with active BD were significantly higher than the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with active and inactive BD showed higher plasma and whole-blood levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The plasma and whole-blood <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels of the samples collected at the same time showed a linear correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A close relationship was found to exist between the cell-associated IL-8 and the disease activity, while a persistent role of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 was observed in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Measuring the whole-blood levels of chemokines is useful for monitoring the disease activity </plain></SENT>
