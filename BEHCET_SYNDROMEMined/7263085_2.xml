<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of alpha 2-PAG in 24 control subjects were less than 10 micrograms/ml, whereas 11/26 (42%; p less than 0.001) of patients with ROU and 20/33 (61%; p less than 0.0005) with BS had concentrations greater than 10 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence staining for alpha 2-PAG on the surface membrane of blood mononuclear cells suggests that there is an increase in the number of alpha 2-PAG-positive cells in BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is not clear at present whether the increased concentrations of alpha 2-PAG might exert an inhibitory effect on the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between the levels of alpha 2-PAG in ROU and BS and concentrations of alpha 1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, C9, factor B or lysozyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is therefore unlikely that the increase in alpha 2-PAG is a manifestation of an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase protein </plain></SENT>
