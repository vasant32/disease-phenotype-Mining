<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Gramzyme A (GrA) is a serine proteinase with trypsin-like activity that is released extracellularly during the degranulation of cytotoxic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the cytotoxic cells, gamma/delta T cells participate in the early phases of the immune response and are known to express perforin and granzymes constitutively in agreement with their cytolytic pontential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: GrA activity was detected using the synthetic substrate N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18019,29967">L-lysine</z:chebi> thiobenzyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> in the plasma and supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultured in the presence of Dimethylallyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> to obtain Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly high levels of GrA were found in the serum and supernatants of lymphocytes from patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease cultured in the presence of DMAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels were found to be significantly lower after remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was observed between GrA levels in the supernatants and the Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell expansion factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells are active participants in the pathogenesis of the disease through their degranulation and granzyme release </plain></SENT>
