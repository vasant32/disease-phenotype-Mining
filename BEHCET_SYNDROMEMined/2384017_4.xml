<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies to several <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> proteins, circulating lymphocyte subsets and cellular reactivity to S-antigen were evaluated repeatedly during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody titers were similar in patients and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However the serum content of antibodies to IRBP or S-antigen was lessened during inflammatory periods in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some sera, antibodies reacted with enzyme digested S-antigen preparations by immunoblot, whereas the same sera were negative for the native protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decrease of the CD4+ subpopulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes was associated with relapses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339402" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birdshot retinochoroidopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this disease and in idiopathic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, the positive lymphocyte stimulation test and basophil degranulation test with S-antigen were significantly most frequent in the period preceding a relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These tests could therefore be of predictive value for relapses occurring within the next few months </plain></SENT>
