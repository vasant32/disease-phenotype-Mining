<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 115 patients with BD and 114 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TNFalpha promoter at positions -1031, -863, -857, -308, -238, and -646 were analysed using automated sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in patients with BD and controls using the chi(2)-test or Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype frequency was also assessed using the chi(2)-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no significant differences in the frequencies of polymorphic genotypes and alleles of the TNFalpha promoter region between BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resulting haplotype frequencies of the BD patients were also not significantly different from those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the TNFalpha promoter polymorphisms analysed here were associated with clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with the novel -646A allele of the TNFalpha promoter region were significantly associated with the expression of the HLA-B51 allele (p(corr) = 0.006), although this novel polymorphic allele was not associated with BD susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The novel -646A TNFalpha allele was associated with the expression of HLA-B51 in Korean BD, although we found no genetic role of TNFalpha promoter polymorphisms in the susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies to examine the contributions of this gene polymorphism and HLA-B51 to the susceptibility to BD in large populations are required </plain></SENT>
