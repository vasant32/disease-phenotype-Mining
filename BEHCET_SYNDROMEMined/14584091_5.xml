<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been postulated that an imbalance of the oxidant and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> systems related to the disease are important in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous publications have reported increased levels of enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defence systems in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The non-enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> systems, including <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, were looked for in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this aim, the serum malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), an end product of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, as endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, were determined in 20 patients with BD (11 in active and 9 in inactive periods) and 20 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level was significantly higher in both the active and inactive period patients compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> level was also significantly higher in the active period patients compared with the inactive period patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in both the active and inactive period patients compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> level between the active and inactive period patients (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant difference in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels between the groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the patients group, a negative correlation was found between the levels of serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (r=-0.517; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that decreased <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and increased <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels reflect the increased levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in BD patients, and this situation may be important in relation with its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
