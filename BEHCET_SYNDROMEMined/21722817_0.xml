<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in BD has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with BD is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and to investigate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) size and the distribution of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) subpopulations in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty six BD patients were compared to 36 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) levels were measured using standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subclasses and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> size were estimated using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> linear gradient gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level was measured by a turbidimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) level was determined using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In BD patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels as well as its subfraction levels were decreased (respectively, p &lt;10(-6) and p &lt;10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Percentage of HDL2 subpopulation was also decreased (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HDL3 subfraction was significantly higher (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TC was correlated with CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and its subfractions were correlated with CRP and TG levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subparticle percentages were also correlated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of a reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and HDL2 subpopulation and an increase HDL3 subclass and a higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratio may be considered as important predictors of cardiovascular events in BD patients </plain></SENT>
