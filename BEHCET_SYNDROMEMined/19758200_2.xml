<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microlymphocytotoxicity test was used to perform serologic HLA typing in a group of 124 healthy volunteers and a group of 365 patients suffering from clinical manifestations of AS and/or BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-B27 was found in 3.2% of healthy subjects and in 42.9% of patients with AS (P &lt; 0.00006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 is, however, found in 16.1% of healthy subjects and in 30.0% of patients with BD (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike HLA-B51, which seems to be as frequent in Tunisian patients with BD as in healthy subjects, HLA-B27 is more frequent in patients with AS than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This highlights the usefulness of HLA-B27, rather than that of HLA-B51, in the diagnosis of the respective diseases </plain></SENT>
