<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed nailfold capillaroscopy in 128 randomly selected patients fulfilling the international classification criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Capillaroscopy was done in eight fingers with a x3.2 microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were questioned for history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e>, ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, smoking, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computerized form including demographic, clinical, and para-clinical features was used to collect data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the relation between capillaroscopic findings and disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio and a confidence interval at 95% (CI) were calculated for each item </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 37 +/- 10 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.56:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Capillaroscopy was abnormal in 51 patients (40%, CI 8.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Enlarged capillaries were seen in 33 patients (26%, CI 7.6), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in 21 (16%, CI 6.4), and capillary loss only in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In univariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of enlarged capillaries was associated with lower age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (OR = 0.9, CI 0.9-1; p = 0.04), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 4.2, CI 1.5-11.4; p = 0.006), superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> (OR = 5.5, CI 1.2-24.4; p = 0.03), and negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (OR = 0.4, CI 0.2-0.9; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> tended to be associated with articular symptoms (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis also confirmed the association of enlarged capillaries with lower age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p = 0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.001), and superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nailfold abnormalities, mainly enlarged capillaries, are frequent in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that these abnormalities may be related to other vascular features of the disease such as superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp>, but it does not seem to confer special risk for any other specific clinical symptom of the disease </plain></SENT>
