<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case report of a patient suffering from Behet's syndrome with pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of endobronchial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> in the bronchus intermedius and right upper lobe bronchus led to severe bronchial stenosis and dyspnoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulcerations</z:e> in the bronchial mucosa occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the granulomatous stenosis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33372">Neodym</z:chebi>-YAG laser resection and immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On follow-up there was a recurrence of the stenosis, characterised by fibrotic strictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore a balloon dilation was performed and immunosuppression instituted, which led to an increase in airway diameter and a reduction in dyspnoea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These clinical results suggest that recanalisation therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33372">Neodym</z:chebi>-YAG laser and/or balloon dilation with additional immunosuppression is suitable in benign stenosis (granulomatous or fibrotic), caused by Behet's disease </plain></SENT>
