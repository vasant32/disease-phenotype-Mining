<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of disease duration, disease activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dosage, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> levels was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six consecutive BD outpatients and 26 healthy controls matched for age, education and sex completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including tests of memory, visuospatial and constructional abilities, language, attention and psychomotor speed, non-verbal reasoning and executive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Hamilton scales for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed using the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, BD patients were significantly impaired on tasks evaluating long-term verbal and non-verbal memory, and visuospatial skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, BD patients were significantly more anxious and depressed than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was evident in 46.1% of BD patients compared with none of control subjects (p&lt;0.0001), with memory representing the cognitive domain most affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both high disease activity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.5, p&lt;0.04) and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dosage (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7, p&lt;0.03) were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in BD after adjustment for demographic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, involving mainly memory functions, occurs frequently in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may occur independently of clinically overt neurological involvement, and is more common in patients with an active disease and in those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
