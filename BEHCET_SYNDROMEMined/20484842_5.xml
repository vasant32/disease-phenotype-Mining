<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of platelet function, and the increase in MPV has been identified as an independent risk factor of recurrent vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BD is characterized by a relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of the venous as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying thrombotic tendency in BD are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that there might be an association between thrombotic complication and MPV in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated activation of platelets in patients with BD using a simple marker, MPV, the most accurate measure of platelet size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 60 patients with BD and 40 age- and gender-matched controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BD patients were divided into subgroups based on the presence (n = 22) or absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 38) and clinically active (n = 30) or inactive (n = 30) state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MPV was higher in patients with BD than controls (8.14 +/- 0.8 vs. 7.48 +/- 0.3 fl, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among BD patients, MPV was larger in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (8.45 +/- 1.0 vs. 7.96 +/- 0.7 fl, p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in MPV between BD patients with active and inactive states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increase in MPV is independent of the disease activity, and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is associated with higher MPV in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, antiplatelet therapy may be useful to prevent thrombotic complications in BD patients </plain></SENT>
