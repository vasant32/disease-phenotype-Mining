<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven randomly selected BD patients and the patients in the control group (N=40) were evaluated by two blind rheumatologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hands were examined for the presence of pain, tenderness, swelling, effusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, warmth, range of motion and limitation of motion, deformities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then scintigraphic examination of the hands was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control hand scintigrams were obtained from 40 age- and sex-matched patients and were examined by the same two observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two of the 57 patients (56.1%) showed <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's clinical hand findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Terminal phalangeal pulp <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was observed in 17 (29.81%), rheumatoid-like hand findings were observed in 16 (28.1%), dorsal interosseos <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was observed in 12 (20.05%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> over the digits was observed in 12 (20.05%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (42.1%) had scintigraphic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease duration was observed to be an important factor for hand findings (P=0.040) and scintigraphic involvement (P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High prevalence of hand involvement in BD and its relationship with disease duration is demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hand involvement tends to be overlooked and careful examination is required in the evaluation of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The scintigraphic involvement detected in hands requires special consideration, too </plain></SENT>
