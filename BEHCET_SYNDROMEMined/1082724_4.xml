<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of an evaluation of the clinical picture and of the progression three stages of the disease were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These stages were compared to the changes in amplitude of the b-waves of the ERGs (Fig 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings in this group of patients were also compared to those from 11 patients with "simple" <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> (Fig. 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The electroretinographic results in both these groups were highly similar: in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients progression of the ocular disease was accompanied by parallel reduction in amplitude of the b-wave of the ERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ERG responses were affected in a similar way: the rod-system was in general more severly affected than the cone-system in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data it appears that the ERG indicates the stage of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, we could not detect ERG changes characteristic for the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
