<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the parenchyma has been found to worsen the prognosis in patients with neuroBehçet (NB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical features and course of patients with NB involving the parenchyma of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: Seven patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and neurological localizing signs were seen in our hospital between 1989 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnosis was of ischemic ictus in five of the seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both neuroimaging studies and investigation of the cerebrospinal fluid were always pathological in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular studies (arteriography and echo-Doppler of the supra-aortic trunks) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had serious sequelae following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NB should be included in the different diagnosis of ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the parenchyma of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> was accompanied by lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, perhaps also leading to a worse functional prognosis </plain></SENT>
