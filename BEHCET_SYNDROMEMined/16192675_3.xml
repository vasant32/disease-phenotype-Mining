<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generalized derangements of the lymphocyte and neutrophil populations, activated monocytes, and increased PMNLs motility with upregulated cell surface molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, which are found on the endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets, have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been demonstrated during the course of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to investigate the association of serum concentrations of soluble P-selectin in patients with BS, and to evaluate whether disease activity has an effect on their blood levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This multicenter study included 31 patients with BS (15 men and 16 women) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control volunteers (11 men and nine women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants as well as soluble P-selectin levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age and sex distributions were similar (P &gt; .05) between BS patients (35 years) and control volunteers (36 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of soluble P-selectin in patients with BS (399 +/- 72 ng/mL) were significantly (P &lt; .001) higher when compared with control subjects (164 +/- 40 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, active BS patients (453 +/- 37 ng/mL) had significantly (P &lt; .001) elevated levels of soluble P-selectin than those in inactive period (341 +/- 52 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study clearly demonstrated that serum soluble P-selectin levels are increased in BS patients when compared with control subjects, suggesting a modulator role for soluble P-selectin during the course of platelet activation and therefore, atherothrombogenesis formation in BS, especially in active disease </plain></SENT>
