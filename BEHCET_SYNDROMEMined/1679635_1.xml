<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> showed massive perivascular infiltration of the lymphocytes and plasma cells in adventitia and vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrous obliteration of the vasa vasorum was seen, and neutrophilic infiltration was also associated in two cases with recurrent prosthetic valve failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> showed similar histologic features, but giant cells and histiocytic reactions were additional findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0391861" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Plasma cell infiltration</z:e> was more pronounced compared to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of luetic <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> showed a non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory reaction with florid endothelial cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> showed fibrous thickening at the periannular portion of the aortic valve cusps, but this finding was also seen in an aortic valve of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case without any disease association showed similar features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with granuloma formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that they have similar histologic features indistinguishable in terms of the clinical disease association, but a granulomatous reaction could be expected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
