<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the Helicobacter pylori seropositivity and cytotoxin associated gene-A status in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 83 age- and sex-matched persons with or without any gastrointestinal complaints were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics and H. pylori IgG, IgM, and cytotoxin-associated gene-A IgG status of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and the control groups were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The influence of eradication therapy on clinical findings was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of H. pylori IgG seropositivity was slightly but not significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared to the controls [72 (79.1%) vs 56 (67.5%), (p = 0.082)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of cytotoxin-associated gene A positivity was significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared to the controls [59 (64.8.%) vs 32 (38.5%), respectively, (p = 0.002)] </plain></SENT>
