<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">PGE1</z:chebi> named OP1206 has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OP1206 is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation as well as a strong <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, and its half-life in humans is extremely prolonged because it is not metabolized in the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leg ulceration is one of the cutaneous manifestations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and sometimes is very difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this investigation five patients having <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were treated with OP1206 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had the leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> for more than 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen micrograms of OP1206 was given initially, and the dosage was increased to 30 micrograms whenever there were no adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were soon able to tolerate the drug and increased dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within 2 weeks, regeneration of granulomatous tissues was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> healed within one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one patient developed diarrhoea, but this symptom disappeared when he adjusted to the dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings strongly indicate that OP1206 is a safe and promising drug for the treatment of leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
