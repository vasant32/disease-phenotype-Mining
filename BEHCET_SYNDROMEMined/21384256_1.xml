<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involvement of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> occurs in 4-48% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of subclinical neuropsychiatric affection in asymptomatic Egyptian BD patients using psychometric tests and brain imaging with single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), also to assess possibly associated clinical predictive variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five BD patients without overt <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement and ten healthy controls matched for age, education, and sex completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including Hamilton scales for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and Wechsler memory scale-revised </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences between cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal SPECT were found regarding disease duration, frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, BDCAF, frequency of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e>, major vascular involvement, mean Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores, and mean MQ </plain></SENT>
