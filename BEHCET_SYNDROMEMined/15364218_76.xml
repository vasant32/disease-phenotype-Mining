<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to compare visual prognosis between male and female sex and between patients who presented before and after 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of 880 consecutive patients (1,567 eyes) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> seen at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> Service, Department of Ophthalmology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, from 1980 to 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met the classification criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on the patient's sex, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, ocular features, ocular complications, visual acuity, and systemic treatment was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-nine patients (68%) were male and 281 (32%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was 28.5 years in male and 30 years in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ocular involvement was bilateral in 78.1% and unilateral in 21.9% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>Panuveitis</z:hpo> was the most common form in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fundus lesions as well as sight-threatening complications were more common in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of the follow-up, potential visual acuity was 0.1 or less in 30.9% of eyes in males and 24.2% of eyes in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated the risks of losing useful vision (&gt;0.1) at 5 and 10 years for males and females as 21% vs 10% and 30% vs 17%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Male patients who presented in the 1990s had a significantly lower risk of losing vision compared with male patients who presented in the 1980s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> starts frequently around the end of the third decade and has a male predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The disease is more severe and the risk of losing useful vision is higher in males than in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this risk has been significantly reduced in the 1990s </plain></SENT>
