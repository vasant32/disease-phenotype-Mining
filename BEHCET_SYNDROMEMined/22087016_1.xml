<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Recent genetic surveys including a genome-wide association study have identified CD40 as a susceptibility gene for several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the association of CD40 gene polymorphisms with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome in a Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs4810485 and rs1883832, were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 373 BD patients, 519 VKH patients and 402 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the influence of gender on the association of CD40 polymorphisms with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of the homozygous rs4810485 TT and rs1883832 TT in BD patients as compared with the controls [Bonferroni-corrected P-value for gender adjustment (Pac) = 0.006, odds ratio (OR) = 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38, 2.83;  = 0.012, OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.22, 2.46, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A markedly decreased frequency of the heterozygous rs4810485 GT was observed in BD patients as compared with the controls (  = 0.042, OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.51, 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genotype and allele frequencies of rs4810485 and rs1883832 were not different between VKH patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis did not find any association between the tested SNPs and extra-ocular manifestations of both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that TT genotypes of rs4810485 and rs1883832 may be predisposing genotypes for BD, and that the rs4810485 GT genotype may be a protective genotype for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The two tested CD40 gene polymorphisms are not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e> in the investigated Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
