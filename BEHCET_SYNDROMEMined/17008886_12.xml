<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During periods of smoking, patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease have less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e> than in abstinence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate this observation, human keratinocytes and dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were incubated with serum of 20 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 20 healthy controls for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximum non-toxic concentrations were determined and the cells were further treated with 6 microM <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>, 3.3% cigarette smoke extract (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>), 100 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17574">biochanin A</z:chebi>, and 6.25/12.5 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi> dithiocarbamate alone and in combinations for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-8 levels of patients were significantly lower than those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after 4 hours incubation with patients' sera, IL-8 release by both cell types was markedly increased when compared with the corresponding serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release were after 4 hours similar with the corresponding levels in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-1 was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi> significantly decreased IL-8 and -6 release by HMEC-1 maintained in both patients' and controls' sera, but only IL-6 release by keratinocytes maintained in patients' sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGF release by both cells was markedly increased after <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> treatment in either serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> significantly decreased IL-8 release and increased production of VEGF in keratinocytes maintained in patients' serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The phytoestrogen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17574">biochanin A</z:chebi> alone and in combination with <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> further decreased the secretion of IL-8, -6, and VEGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data support a specific anti-inflammatory effect of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> on keratinocytes and endothelial cells maintained in the serum of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
