<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Antikinectin autoantibody has recently been identified as a potential biomarker in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) for detecting this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of antikinectin was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Partial or full-length cloning for human kinectin in prokaryotic or eukaryotic system was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three fragments covered kinectin coding sequence were used to establish ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Full-length kinectin overexpressed HepG2 cells were used as a substrate for IFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from BD (n = 46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> SLE, n = 16), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA, n = 160, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS, n = 14), primary Sjörgen syndrome (pSS, n = 12), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>, n = 8), and healthy donors (n = 51) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Good measurement consistency between IFA and ELISA (p &lt; 0.001) and previous immunoprecipitation assay (p = 0.011) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antikinectin was found not only in 32.6% (IFA) to 41.3% (ELISA) BD patients but was also identified in pSS, SLE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>, and RA with prevalence ranging from 12.5% to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the titer of antikinectin (ELISA) is statistically higher in BD compared to other autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> (p = 0.0286) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antikinectin was found exclusively among complete form of BD (p &lt; 0.001), but there was no correlation with specific clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the previous observation that antikinectin is related to BD, especially in the complete form of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The specificity and predictive values are moderate </plain></SENT>
