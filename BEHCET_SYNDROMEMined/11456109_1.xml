<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, the functions of the N-terminal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> consisting of Asp-2 to Val-43 of beta-actin (42-merP) and the truncated actin with an N-terminus of Met-44 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We first confirmed that the 42-merP existed in the patient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The motility of human peripheral blood neutrophils and neutrophilic granulocytes differentiated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was suppressed by the 42-merP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when neutrophil-like cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells were preincubated with 10 nm 42-merP, migration of the cells induced by chemotactic factors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> and IL-8 was suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The release of PMN-elastase, which is a neutrophil granular enzyme that is responsible for the production of the 42-merP and truncated actin, was suppressed by pretreating the neutrophils with 42-merP before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>-stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The truncated actin was unable to polymerize in 0.1 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, suggesting that the increase of truncated actin damages the reconstitution capacity of actin in neutrophils of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the increase of 42-merP and truncated actin in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease changes functions of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
