<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the topographic characteristics of the optic discs in patients with severe and mild ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease by using Heidelberg <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> tomographaphy (HRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study included 47 eyes of 47 patients with ocular BD who were being followed-up at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> Clinic of the Ankara Ulucanlar Eye Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 21 eyes with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and group 2 consisted of 26 eyes with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent topographic optic disc analysis by HRT II, and the quantitative optic disc parameters of both groups were compared by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean cup volume, rim volume, cup area, disc area and cup depth in group 1 were found to be statistically significantly greater than those in group 2 (p&lt;0.0001, p = 0.03, p = 0.021, p = 0.01 and p = 0.017, respectively), while the difference between the mean cup-to-disc ratios in group 1 and group 2 were found to be statistically insignificant (p = 0.148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A relationship was found between the severity of ocular BD and optic disc topography determined by HRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eyes with smaller optic discs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was observed to have a more severe course with more frequent relapses than those with larger discs </plain></SENT>
