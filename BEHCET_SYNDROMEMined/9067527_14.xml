<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etiology and pathogenesis of BD remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha/V beta gene product expression as well as Jbeta gene segment expression in peripheral blood of BD patients were analysed to investigate the possible role of T lymphocytes in the etiopathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry with 12 TCR V-specific MoAbs was used for TCRV analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Jbeta gene segment usage by T cell populations expressing certain V betas was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with V beta- and C beta-specific primers, Southern blotting of PCR products, and subsequent hybridization with radiolabelled Jbeta gene segment-specific probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although 13 of the 23 BD patients exhibited increases in expression of one or more TCR V-gene products, only expansions among the CD4+ T cell subset were significantly more frequent in BD patients (7/23) compared with healthy controls (0/15) (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six out of eight cases followed for up to 20 months had at least one expansion correlated with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strict preference for particular Jbeta gene segments implicating clonality was apparent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analysed T cell expansions and correlated well with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a possible involvement of antigen-specific T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
