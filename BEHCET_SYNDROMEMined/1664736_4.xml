<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report addresses in vivo effects of BG-104 in various disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma SSA and laboratory parameters were determined in patients <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> (SjS) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> (M), and the effects of BG-104 treatment on these parameters were studied and compared with those of another <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, vitamin E (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma SSA was significantly lower both in patients with BD and M, and in patients with SjS without <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> treatment as compared to that in healthy controls, and it showed an inverse correlation with disease activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment with BG-104 and/or vitamin E significantly enhanced the plasma SSA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disorders studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the erythrocyte sedimentation rates, the absolute number of neutrophils, as well as C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in patients treated with BG-104 and/or vitamin E than those without these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the BG-104 has an anti-inflammatory effect through enhancing plasma SSA in patients with BD, SjS or M </plain></SENT>
