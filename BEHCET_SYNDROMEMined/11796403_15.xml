<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was suggested that MIC-A (major histocompatibility complex class I related gene A) is the pathogenic gene after strong association was found between the MIC-A A6 allele of the transmembrane region and the disease in Japanese and Greek patients, although in Greek patients this association was found to be due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate microsatellite polymorphism in Arab and non-Ashkenazi Jewish (NAJ) patients in Israel, to determine whether this association occurs in these groups with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and elucidate the associated HLA allele of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty four Israeli patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, including 20 Arabs and 24 NAJ, and 130 ethnically matched healthy controls were examined for MIC-A microsatellite polymorphism of the transmembrane region using polymerase chain reaction, autoradiography, and sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MIC-A A6 allele was significantly more frequent in the Arab patient group (19/20 (95%)) than in healthy Arab controls (25/42 (60%)) (p(corr)=0.015, OR=12.92), but not in the NAJ patients (16/24 (67%)) compared with NAJ healthy controls (48 /88 (55%)) (p(corr)=1.02, OR=1.667) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In stratification analysis of the Arab subgroup, on the confounding effect of MIC-A A6 on HLA-B51 association and vice versa, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was distinctly associated only with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results imply strong association between the MIC-A A6 allele and the disease in Israeli Arabs, but not in Israeli NAJ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stratification analysis indicates that this association results secondarily from a strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51, and the real disease susceptibility gene which plays a part in the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is most probably the HLA-B51 allele itself </plain></SENT>
