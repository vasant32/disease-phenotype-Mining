<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To predict the clinical outcome in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> according to the colonoscopic findings, we classified the characteristic colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, evaluated the efficacy of medical treatment on colonoscopic lesions, and calculated the operation rates and recurrence rates relative to the macroscopic types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records and colonoscopic photographs of 50 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The colonic lesions were examined by colonoscopy in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and gastrointestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The colonoscopic findings were categorized into three types of ulceration: volcano-like, geographic, and aphthous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of medical treatment was assessed by follow-up colonoscopy or double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema four to eight weeks after treatment, and recurrence of the lesions was evaluated during the follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative surgery rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The macroscopic classification of colonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> identified 25 of 50 patients (50%) with volcano-type lesions, 11 (22%) with the geographic type, and 14 (28%) with the aphthous type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of complete remission after medical treatment and surgery, respectively, were six of 25 (24%) and 13 of 25 (52%) with volcano-type ulcerations; eight of 11 (73%) and one of 11 (9%) with the geographic type; and nine of 14 (64%) and two of 14 (14%) with the aphthous type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic and clinical recurrence rates were nine of 19 (47%) in volcano-type ulcerations, one of nine (11%) in the geographic type, and one of 11 (9%) in the aphthous type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Volcano-type ulcerations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> showed a less favorable response to medical treatment, a more frequent requirement for surgery, and more frequent recurrences than the geographic and aphthous types of ulcerations </plain></SENT>
