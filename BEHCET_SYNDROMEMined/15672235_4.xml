<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 14 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and nine with familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and 16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Synovial chemokine levels were measured by two-step sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and significant differences were found in the various chemokines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to its angiogenic properties, increased synovial levels of interleukin-8 by attraction of more neutrophils to synovial fluids might also be responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> changes with the eventual development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155094,C0333350" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">pannus</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> might result from relatively lower expression of interleukin-8 and the transient, short-lived nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
