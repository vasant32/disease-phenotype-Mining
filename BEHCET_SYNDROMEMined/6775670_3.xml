<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In five of seven patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and in five of thirteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum a significant elongation of euglobulin lysis time was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in two patients with allergic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, a significant shortening of euglobulin lysis time was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, factors responsible for the change of euglobulin lysis time were sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that the significant elongation of euglobulin lysis time in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum was based on an increase of fibrinogen content in the euglobulin fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it was speculated that the significant elongation of euglobulin lysis time in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease might be due to an increase of antiactivators in the patients' plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the authors further investigated the status of this antiactivator which is increased in plasma of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and proposed the possibility that the increased antiactivator might consist of at least two types of antiactivators, one of which is considered to be alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor </plain></SENT>
