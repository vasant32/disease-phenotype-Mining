<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role played by HLA-B51 in the neutrophil hyperfunction of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, we determined the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production by purified peripheral blood neutrophils from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients, from HLA-B51 positive healthy individuals, and from HLA-B51 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neutrophil function was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis, detecting the conversion of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate into dichloroflurescein, induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in the neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation between the neutrophil hyperfunction and the possession of HLA-B51 phenotype, regardless of the presence of the disease, was observed in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi>-stimulated neutrophils (without in vitro priming) from HLA-B51 transgenic mice, but not those from HLA-B35 transgenic mice or from nontransgenic mice, produced substantial amounts of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA-B51 molecule itself may be responsible, at least in part, for neutrophil hyperfunction in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
