<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of anti-VCA (viro-capsid antigen) and anti-EA (early antigen) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients and in controls were similar, but the frequency of sera with elevated titers (greater than or equal to 1:160) and the geometric mean titer of anti-VCA in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> was significantly higher than in the controls (P less than 0.025, P less than 0.01) and in the patients with pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of sera with elevated titers of anti-EBNA (Epstein-Barr virus associated nuclear antigen) (greater than or equal to 1:160) in the patients with pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was significantly lower than in the controls (P less than 0.02) and in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
