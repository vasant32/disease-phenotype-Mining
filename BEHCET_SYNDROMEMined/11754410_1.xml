<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated plasma total TFPI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, and some other coagulation and fibrinolytic system parameters in 30 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 15 controls by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TFPI levels were significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group (119 +/- 57.5 ng/ml) compared with the control group (74.8 +/- 31.5) (P &lt; 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also noted a statistical significance in TFPI levels between patients with active disease (n:16) (139 +/- 55) and patients without activation (n:14) (96 +/- 53) (P &lt; 0.03), whereas inactive patients lacked any significance when compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other parameters disclosed no statistical significance between patients and control group except for elevated fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels in the patient group (P &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of TFPI may reflect a defensive mechanism like in other diseases characterized by thrombotic tendency and represent a parameter of disease activity </plain></SENT>
