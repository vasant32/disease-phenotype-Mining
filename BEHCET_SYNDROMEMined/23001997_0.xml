<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) and functional studies were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 149 patients and 951 controls were enrolled in the initial GWAS, and 554 patients and 1,159 controls were enrolled in the replication study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction, luciferase reporter assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our GWAS and replication studies identified a susceptibility locus around STAT4 (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] rs7574070, rs7572482, and rs897200; P = 3.36 × 10(-7) to 6.20 × 10(-9) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of STAT4 was observed in individuals carrying the rs897200 risk genotype AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the idea that STAT4 regulates the production of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon-γ, IL17 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were increased in individuals carrying the rs897200 risk genotype AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the risk allele A of rs897200 creates a putative transcription factor binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To test whether it directly affects STAT4 transcription, an in vitro luciferase reporter gene assay was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher transcription activity was observed in individuals carrying the risk allele A, suggesting that rs897200 is likely to directly affect STAT4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 2 SNPs, rs7574070 and rs7572482, which are tightly linked with rs897200, were cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) SNPs, suggesting that SNP rs897200 is an eQTL SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the clinical disease severity score was higher in individuals with the rs897200 risk genotype AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings strongly suggest that STAT4 is a novel locus underlying BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We propose a model in which up-regulation of STAT4 expression and subsequent STAT4-driven production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, constitute a potential pathway leading to BD </plain></SENT>
