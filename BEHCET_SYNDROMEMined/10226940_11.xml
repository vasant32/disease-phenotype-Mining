<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in patients with BD, and the correlation between major or minor <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and systemic expression and severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with BD were studied, of whom 13 (37%) had major, 21 (60%) had minor and one (3%) had herpetiform <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of major <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> was significantly higher compared with a control group of patients with idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (37% vs 9%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BD patients with major <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> had significantly more relapses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> in a year, higher numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> per relapse, and longer duration of aphthous episodes, compared with patients with minor <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcers</z:hpo> also appeared at a significantly younger age in patients with major than with minor <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the systemic expression of the disease, as well as the disease severity score, were similar in patients with major and minor <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that major <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> is common in patients with BD, and is associated with a more severe, repeated and prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the presence of major <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in BD does not predict a more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> </plain></SENT>
