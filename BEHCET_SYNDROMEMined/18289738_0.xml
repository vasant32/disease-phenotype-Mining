<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 176 patients with BD who were followed between 1980 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients fulfilled the international study group on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rheumatic manifestations were noticed in 79 out of 176 patients (45%), ranking second after the skin and mucosal manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Articular manifestations were the first disease manifestation in 16.5% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> were the most common manifestation and observed in 81%, interesting mainly the large lower limb joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease course was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> was less common: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oligoarthritis</z:e> (7.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158026,C0494905" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">monoarthritis</z:e> (6.5%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthritis</z:e> (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Axial involvement was also noted: spine pain in 29%, isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sacroiliitis</z:e> in 7.5%, and definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Joint involvement is common in BD and could be the first manifestation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients present with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> of the large lower limb joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disease course is usually favourable, spontaneously or with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in our study population, skeletal manifestations were responsible for significant disability </plain></SENT>
