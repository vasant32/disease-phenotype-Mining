<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OCE significantly inhibited the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), compared to absence of OCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects of OCE showed in a dose-dependent manner, and OCE had better effects than immunosuppressive drug, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OCE is able to effectively inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and immunoregulatory Th1 cytokine </plain></SENT>
