<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of pimecrolimus (PIM) cream on the pain and healing time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 76 patients were randomized to either receive PIM cream plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (COL) tablets (1-2 g/day) or COL tablets (1-2 g/day) alone for 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluations were performed in 68 patients at the baseline and on the 3rd, 7th, 10th, 14th and 28th days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> pain was evaluated using a verbal pain score at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety was monitored through adverse event reporting and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean healing time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> was shorter in the PIM + COL group (4.2 +/- 1.5 days) than the COL group (4.7 +/- 1.8 days), without statistical significance (p = 0.399) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual analog scale scores decreased in both groups significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither of the treatment modalities was found to be superior to the other; however, pain was relieved in 4.2 +/- 0.5 days in PIM + COL group and in 5.5 +/- 1.2 days in COL group in the intention to treat population (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Observed adverse events were transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to COL alone, COL + PIM cream shortens the pain duration without any significant effect on healing time </plain></SENT>
