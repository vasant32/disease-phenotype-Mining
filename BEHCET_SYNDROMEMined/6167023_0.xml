<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were as follows: (1) The mean value of CSF cell counts was 126 +/- 177/3 mm3 in 88 specimens from the patients, and 2.9 +/- 2.4/3 mm3 in 30 specimens from healthy control subjects, the former being significantly higher than the latter (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) In the patients' CSF, the average percentages of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells were 67 +/- 23% and 32 +/- 23%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(3) In CSF cytogram from 37 specimens from the patients, the average percentage of small lymphocytes was 59 +/- 19%, which was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than control (71 +/- 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average percentage of activated lymphocytes, activated monocytes and neutrophils which were not observed in control were 0.5 +/- 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1.9 +/- 2.2% and 17 +/- 16%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) The ratio of nucleic acids (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>/DNA) measured by microspectrophotometry (Zeiss UMSP-1) in CSF lymphocytes stained with methylgreen and pyronin was 0.58 +/- 0.12 in 17 specimens from the patients and 0.55 +/- 0.07% in 10 specimens from the control; there was no significant difference between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the pleocytosis in Neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may represent perivascular inflammatory process in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
