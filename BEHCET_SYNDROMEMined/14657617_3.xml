<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of plasma from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) on the production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: NO levels were measured in cell culture media after 24-hour incubation of the cells with plasma obtained from 22 BD patients and 16 age/sex-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After treatment of the patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, 12 of the patients were considered to be in the inactive phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of NO production were also measured in these 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the in vitro experiments, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(2)-macroglobulin and neutrophil counts were measured in the patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of NO in active state BD patients (15.9 micromol/10(6) cells) were significantly lower than values obtained from both patients in the inactive period (19.2 micromol/10(6) cells) and the control group (19.7 micromol/10(6) cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in induced NO products between the patients in the inactive stage and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma from BD patients decreased the level of NO production in the HUVECs, and therefore may cause dysfunction in the endothelial NO synthase activity </plain></SENT>
