<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, pulmonary artery involvement in BD is not limited to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>; the other main type of pulmonary artery involvement is pulmonary artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (PAT), with or without associated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> like nodules and cavities in the lung parenchyma are frequently associated with pulmonary artery involvement, and can be misinterpreted as being due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We surveyed the clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics and outcome of 47 BD patients with pulmonary artery involvement and the associated findings, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seen and followed at a single dedicated tertiary care center.We identified 47 (41 male, 6 female) patients in whom pulmonary artery involvement was diagnosed, who were registered in the multidisciplinary clinic at Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty between January 2000 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis was 29 ± 8 years, and mean disease duration to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pulmonary artery involvement was 3.6 ± 4.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>Hemoptysis</z:hpo> was the most common presenting symptom (79%) followed by cough, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, and pleuritic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four of 47 patients (72%) presented with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>, including 8 with associated PAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 13 patients (28%) had isolated PAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with isolated PAT in general have clinical features similar to patients with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> was less frequent and voluminous in patients with isolated PAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most (91%) of the patients had active disease outside the lungs when they presented with pulmonary artery involvement.Forty (85%) patients had nodules and 6 (13%) had cavities when first seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was present in 36 of 47 (77%) patients, and intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in 12 of the 36 (33%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nodules, cavities, and intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were mainly present in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages of pulmonary artery involvement.Pulmonary artery involvement is usually multiple, and involves mostly descending branches of the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary artery involvement may disappear, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusions usually develop at the same location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 7 years, 12 of 47 (26%) patients were dead; patients with larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were more likely to die </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 47 (34%) patients were symptom free, and the remaining 40% had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (13/47) and/or small bouts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> (8/47).Pulmonary artery pressure may be elevated, and may indicate a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
