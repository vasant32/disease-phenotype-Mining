<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, a common complication, is painful, recurrent and sometimes resistant to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Topical or intralesional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="36333">local anaesthetics</z:chebi> are used for palliative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether irsogladine, a drug for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo>, reduced aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> lesions in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Irsogladine 2-4 mg/day was administered orally to ten BD patients (cases 1-10), three men and seven women, with a mean age of 48.5 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> as the main symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-existing treatments were not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up at our outpatient clinic once a month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients had no systemic neurological, gastrointestinal or vascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the macroscopic findings of aphthous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We counted the number of aphthous lesions three times prior to administration of irsogladine and three times after treatment at the outpatient clinic, i.e. six times in total, and compared pre- and post-treatment mean numbers of lesions for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Irsogladine was effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> count decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients 3 months after administration (p &lt; 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cases 5 and 6 stopped taking irsogladine of their own accord when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> disappeared; however, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> reappeared, and in both patients, aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> healed completely soon after re-administration of irsogladine </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The dose of irsogladine in this patient was then increased to 4 mg/day, after which aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> resolved </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The improvement in gap-junctional intercellular communication by irsogladine may contribute to the treatment of aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Increasing the dose of irsogladine may resolve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> resistant to low doses of irsogladine </plain></SENT>
