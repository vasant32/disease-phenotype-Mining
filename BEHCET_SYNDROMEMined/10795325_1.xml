<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is also unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with initial mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis means, pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic modalities are also more precisely defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three male patients (21, 25 and 27 years of age, respectively) were hospitalized for progressive vena cava superior syndrome accompanied by mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> demonstrated by MRI and/or CT scan which both showed infiltration of the mediastinal fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple calcifications were also present in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histology was performed in one case </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of venae subclavia and left jugularis was also present in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other manifestations leading to the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were demonstrated by the patient's history and, in one case, occurred on the fourth day of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After initiation of a treatment including corticoids, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, the outcome was favorable in two cases </plain></SENT>
