<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ACE and eNOS gene polymorphisms were investigated in 73 BD patients and 90 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distrubition of "DD", "ID" and "II" genotypes of the ACE gene were 32 (43.8%), 29 (39.8%) and 12 (16.4%) for BD patients and 32 (35.5%), 35 (38.9%) and 23 (25.6%) for healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.140, OR 1.44, CI 0.90-2.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with ocular involvement were compared to the control group, statistical significance was found (p = 0.049, OR 2.18, CI 1.00-4.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The "bb", "ba", and "aa" genotype frequencies of the eNOS gene were 48 (65.8%), 23 (31.5%), and 2 (2.7%) for patients with BD and 75 (83.3%), 15 (16.7%), and 0 (0%) for healthy controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significant difference found in allelic frequencies between the two groups (p = 0.011, OR 2.32, CI 1.11-4.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with ocular involvement were compared, sharper statistical significance was found (p = 0.001,OR 4.61,CI 1.85-11.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The ACE gene polymorphism does not play a role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings of the eNOS gene polymorphisms confirmed the significant association with BD and even more in patients with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
