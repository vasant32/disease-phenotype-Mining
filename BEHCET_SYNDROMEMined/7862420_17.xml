<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, recurrent, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> characterized by the triad of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although many of these patients become blind, some have good vision <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> their life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To attain more accurate data on the prognosis of these patients, the authors studied 52 Japanese patients (101 eyes) seen at Kyushu University Hospital between 1980 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the first visit, patients ranged in age from 21 to 61 years; at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, they ranged in age from 17 to 55 years; and the disease duration at first visit was from 0 to 22 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five of the 101 eyes had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> of more than five lines or the patients became blind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors divided the subjects into two groups--favorable group and unfavorable group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If an eye had more than five lines of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> or the patient became blind 3 years after the first visit, it was placed in the unfavorable group, and if not, it was classed in the favorable group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two factors determined from clinical records were used to select statistically significant risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed the following four factors that were significantly different between favorable and unfavorable groups: sex, disease interval, other complications, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (first year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the following seven factors had mutually independent contributions to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>: <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>; posterior attacks; other complications (experienced), including gastrointestinal, vascular, and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system lesions; female sex; disease interval; and anterior attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The first four factors have effects of losing vision, whereas the others are related to vision retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors find that <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, posterior attacks, and other complications are linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo>, whereas female sex, disease interval, and anterior attacks are related to retention of vision </plain></SENT>
