<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients with BD were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline and stimulated cells with heat shock protein-60 (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-60), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) and crude extract of Streptococcus sanguis (SS) were analyzed for toll-like receptor-1, -2, -4 and -6 expressions using flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were confirmed using semi-quantitative PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of TLR-6 expressing granulocytes in BD patients was significantly lower than in controls (4.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 9.2 +/- 0.6 and 8.0 +/- 1.4, BD vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and healthy control (HC); P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TLR-6 expressing granulocyte population was enhanced after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-60 and SS (20 +/- 0.5 and 12.8 +/- 0.6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased TLR-2 expression was noted in monocytes of BD patients after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-60 and LPS (71.0 +/- 0.5 and 73.0 +/- 0.5; P &lt; 0.02, for both antigens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional abnormalities of these receptors or different activation cascades by different microorganisms are associated with disease pathogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
