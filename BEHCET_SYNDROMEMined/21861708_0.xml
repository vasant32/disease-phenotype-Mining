<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of these mutations to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in Israeli patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with BD (n=54; 27 men and 27 women) underwent clinical and genetic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (n=43; 79.6%) were of Arab descent (31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and 12 familial cases from 4 families), and 11 patients (20.4%) were of Jewish descent (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FV Leiden mutation was identified in five patients (9.2%), and eight patients were MTHFR 677TT homozygotes (14.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had the 20210A mutant prothrombin allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical differences between carriers and noncarriers with regards to demographic and disease manifestations were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arabs were diagnosed earlier than Jewish patients (25.8±11.6 compared with 37.2±10.7, p=0.01, respectively), but Jewish patients had, respectively, more events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) compared with Arabs (3 of 11, 27.3% and 3 of 43, 7%, p=0.09) </plain></SENT>
