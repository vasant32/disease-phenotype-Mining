<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers specific for BD and to establish a diagnostic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from patients with BD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome</z:e> (VKH), and healthy controls (HC) were randomly divided into a training set (49 BD, 31 VKH, and 48 HC) and a testing set (13 BD, 10 VKH, and 11 HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proteomic mass spectra were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine differential m/z peaks associated with BD were identified, and the m/z peaks at 1,644, 1,711, 2,023, 4,347, 6,628, and 8,559 were used to construct a model for the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This diagnostic model can distinguish BD from non-BD controls with a sensitivity of 83.67% (41/49) and a specificity of 89.87% (71/79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD was detected in our blinded testing set with good sensitivity and specificity of 84.6 and 90.48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that proteomic fingerprint technology combining magnetic beads with MALDI-TOF-MS has potential for the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The biomarker classification model was suitable for preliminary identification of BD and could potentially serve as a useful tool for BD diagnosis and differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
