<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We present the description of a successful outcome of intravitreal triamcinolone injection (IVTA) in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular oedema</z:hpo> (CME) and severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> suggestive of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HISTORY AND SIGNS: A healthy 32 year-old Caucasian man presented initially with right <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> with preserved vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite initial systemic treatment with high dose steroids, he developed CME with a reduction in vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>THERAPY AND OUTCOME: IVTA injection was carried out, and resulted in a good anatomic and functional response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same picture developed in his left eye 2 months later and a similar response occurred following IVTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months after the initial episode and despite treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, CME reoccurred in his RE inducing a decrease of his VA from 6/5 to 6/24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IVTA injection was repeated and a week later his VA increased to 6/6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this stage patient was referred for initiation of therapy with infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IVTA injection appears to be very helpful for the resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CME and for visual recovery, but we would like to emphasise that even though this approach seems to be helpful in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> situation, the effect is short-lived and proper immunosuppression is needed for long-term control of the disease and its complications </plain></SENT>
