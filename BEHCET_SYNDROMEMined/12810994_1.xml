<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the acetylator status in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) patients and compare it to a matched group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven healthy volunteers and forty-one BD patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed history was taken from the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 was determined in the BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Clinical Manifestation Index (C.M.I.) was determined for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> test was also done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After an overnight fast, each control subject and patient received a single oral dose of 100 mg of DDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A blood sample was collected after 3 hours and the plasma was separated for determination of dapsone/monoacetyldapsone by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of slow acetylators in healthy individuals was 70.2%, while the frequency of rapid acetylators was 29.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of slow acetylators in BD patients was 53.7%, while the frequency of non-acetylators (undetected monoacetyldapsone MADDS in plasma) was 46.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no rapid acetylators among the BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a strong negative association between the acetylator status and the severity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, acetylator status correlated with HLA-B51, in that BD patients with positive HLA-B51 were characterized by a very slow or non-acetylator status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Slow or non-acetylators had more severe BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BD patients have a unique acetylator status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding may have implications for the theories for the pathogenesis of the disease as well as for therapeutic aspects </plain></SENT>
