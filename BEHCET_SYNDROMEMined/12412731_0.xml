<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> gene polymorphisms have been identified as risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the possible role of the GP Ia C807T/G873A polymorphism as a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ia C807T/G873A gene polymorphism in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was obtained from 20 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and 61 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were of Turkish ancestry and were genotyped for the GP Ia C807T/G873A polymorphism with real-time PCR method by LightCycler system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 807 CC, CT and TT genotypes corresponded with 873 GG, GA and AA genotypes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete linkage between the 807 and 873 sites was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 807CC(873 GG), 807CT(873GA), 807TT(873AA) genotypes found to be 45.9%, 45.9% and 8.1% in controls and 30.0%, 55.0% and 15.0% in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Odds Ratio for BD (OR = 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-9.13) is high for the 807 TT genotype compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was found in 7 cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease group: five cases have 807CT, one case has 807TT genotype and one case has 807CC genotype </plain></SENT>
