<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) develop lesions that clinically resemble those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN) but differ from that condition with regard to their microscopic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 11 sections of EN-like lesions in BD and compared them with 9 sections of classic EN using routine histopathology and immunohistochemistry so as to form a comprehensive picture of the pathologic findings in BD and to determine the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the formation of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>Erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions of BD are characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp>, usually lobular or mixed septal and lobular in pattern, with variable numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes as well as variable numbers of necrotic adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> was noted in most EN-like lesions in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scattered vessels showing lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were evident in 6 sections, and foci of leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were obvious in 4 sections, sometimes with <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003848" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In specimens with classic EN, we did not observe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the percentages of CD3+ lymphocytes and chloroacetate esterase-positive neutrophils in the infiltrating cells showed statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) between EN-like lesions in BD and EN through immunohistochemical and enzyme cytochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the EN-like lesions in BD was extensive and not limited to areas of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, we believe that it is primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> is an important pathologic event in EN-like lesions in BD but cannot determine the extent to which other pathologic changes such as septal or lobular <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp>, fat <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, neutrophilic infiltration, or microabscess formation are secondary features </plain></SENT>
