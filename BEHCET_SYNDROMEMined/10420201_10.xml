<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the 65 kDa heat-shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) of Streptococcus in recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> within the oral cavity may be involved in the uveoretinitis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, possibly through sensitization of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this possibility, we examined serum antibody titers for various members of the 60 kDa family of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> and their implications with regard to a role for HSP60s in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We isolated HSP60 of Streptococcus pyogenes from the margin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e> in one <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patient with severe uveoretinitis and the HSP60s of Yersinia enterocolitica, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> cell line clone Y79, and bovine <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> extract and investigated the reaction of each of these HSP60s with 100-fold diluted serum samples from 20 Behçet's disease patients using anti-HSP60 antibody titers determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anti- Streptococcus HSP60 antibody and anti-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> HSP60 antibody titers of the 100-fold diluted serum samples from the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients were both significantly higher than those of similarly diluted serum samples from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the ELISA antibody titer assay showed that, although the various HSP60s share a common basic antigenicity, they differed in reactivity to the anti-HSP60 antibodies in the sera of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that subtle but significant differences exist in the antigenicity of the various HSP60s tested, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which share a common basic antigenicity and are of approximately the same molecular weight, and suggest that an immuno-cross-reaction between <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and streptococcal <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> and a related <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> may be involved in the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
