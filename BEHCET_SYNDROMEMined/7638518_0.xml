<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Few cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> associated to manifestations suggesting <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case is of a young married woman who presented, during a period of 7 years, clinical manifestations consistent with the late diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, when she developed recurrent lymphomonocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At this time, she was found to be infected by HIV-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> produced an unsatisfactory response and she evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">toxoplasmosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter diagnosis was presumed on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging findings and proved by necropsy after her third hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the factors hindering the appropriate diagnosis was the low level of CD4 and the CD4/CD8 ratio, sometimes observed in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and higher than those observed in patients with this severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No information about the exact period of time she had been infected with HIV-1 is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>So, we do not know whether both diseases were overlooked, if the patient, infected by HIV-1, developed an unusual clinical feature consistent with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, and subsequently evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
