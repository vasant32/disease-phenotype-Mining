<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the influence of IL-17F gene polymorphisms on disease susceptibility and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) patients and 114 controls were genotyped to analyze three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including A126G, G155A, and A161G of the IL-17F gene using automated sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequencies of IL-17F alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes in patients with BD and controls using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in the frequencies of allele and genotype in A126G SNP of IL-17 gene were found between BD patients and controls (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of three IL-17F SNPs were associated with diverse clinical features in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of haplotype AA did not differ between patients with BD and controls (P=0.985) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The haplotypes, AG, and GG, have positive and inverse association with BD susceptibility (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that IL-17 gene SNPs may influence the susceptibility of BD </plain></SENT>
