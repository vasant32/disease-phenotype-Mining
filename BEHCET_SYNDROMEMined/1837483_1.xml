<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six patients (three males and three females), mean age 35.2 years (range 31-43 years), with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial laboratory data indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antithrombin III (ATIII), four patients had low protein C (PC), three patients had low protein S (PS) and two patients had low plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients had high fibrinogen and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had reduced tissue-type plasminogen activator activity, elevated tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor and low fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi>, 5-7 mg/kg orally once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients there was significant elevation of ATIII, PC, PS, and plasminogen, reduction in plasma fibrinogen and PAI and enhancement of fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 12-36 months period of follow-up, there were no symptoms or signs that suggested recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apart from <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> of 5-10 kg and disturbed menstrual cycle in two women, no major side effects were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> is potentially useful therapy that may increase levels of natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in patients with thrombotic illnesses in which ATIII, PC and PS are low or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm these observations </plain></SENT>
