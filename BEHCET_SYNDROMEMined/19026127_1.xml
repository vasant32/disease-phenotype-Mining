<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Current tools for assessing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (BS) do not include patient-reported outcomes such as functional disability, pain or <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined various outcome measures using the multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) and compared them between BS patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also compared the results to those for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), the disease in relation to which the MDHAQ has been most thoroughly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a comparative review of BS and early RA patients being followed at the New York University Hospital for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Joint Diseases</z:e> (NYU HJD) and the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Syndrome Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed an MDHAQ at each visit, which included functional disability, pain, morning stiffness, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and patient and physician global assessments of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A chart review for BS manifestations and treatments was also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patient evaluations reported here represent the baseline values at first visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 129 patients with BS and 116 with early RA were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BS patients had similar pain levels and physician global assessment of disease activity to the RA patients and higher functional disability, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and patient assessments of global disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among BS patients, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> had significantly higher scores for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the outcome measures examined except the physician global assessment of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using the MDHAQ could reveal previously under-recognized problems in BS, as was observed in this survey of BS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such information might be helpful in the management of patients with BS </plain></SENT>
