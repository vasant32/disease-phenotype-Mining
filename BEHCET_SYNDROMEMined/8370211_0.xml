<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We followed up the clinical course and changes of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a case of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and performed serial immunological examinations of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the two episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> (Gd)-enhancement effects on brain MRIs were observed in the brain stem and the deep white matter of cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CSF abnormality of this period was characterized by increases in proportions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and intrathecal IgG synthesis in addition to the findings suggesting breakdown of the blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings disappeared in parallel with clinical improvement by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, during a subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive stage, steroid-resistant neuropsychiatric symptoms and an absence of Gd-enhancement effects on brain MRIs were observed despite progressive breakdown of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease should comprise two distinct immunopathogenetic stages, that is, a relatively early steroid-responsive stage with a relapsing-remitting clinical course and a late steroid-nonresponsive stage with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive course </plain></SENT>
