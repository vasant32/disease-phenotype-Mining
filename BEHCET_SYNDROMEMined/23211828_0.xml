<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical in the innate immune response to microbial invaders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the role of TLRs in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TLR2/4 expression and IL-1β and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were studied in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) obtained from BD patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> (AAU) patients, and healthy controls using real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NLRP3 inflammasome of MDMs was downregulated by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of phosphorylated P38, Erk1/2, and JNK MAPK were evaluated using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TLR2/4 expression was significantly increased in MDMs from active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-1β and ROS production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8005">peptidoglycan</z:chebi> (PGN)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced MDMs from active BD patients was significantly increased compared with inactive BD patients, AAU patients, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ROS activator and inhibitor significantly increased and decreased the production of IL-1β, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The production of IL-1β was significantly decreased after the NLRP3 inflammasome was downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation levels of p38 and ERK1/2 in MDMs from BD patients and controls were increased following stimulation with either PGN or LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly decreased the production of IL-1β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that TLR2/4 expression in MDMs from active BD patients is significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Interaction of TLR2/4 with their ligands PGN/LPS is involved in BD pathogenesis, possibly by the induction of IL-1β through a ROS-NLRP3-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
