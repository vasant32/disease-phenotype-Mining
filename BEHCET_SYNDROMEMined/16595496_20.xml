<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive patients with suspected or documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were prospectively evaluated with whole-body PET/CT 3 h after injection of autologous (18)F-FDG-labeled leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians who were unaware of the clinical end-diagnosis reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PET/CT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A visual score (0-3)-according to uptake intensity-was used to assess studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of PET/CT with (18)F-FDG-labeled white blood cell ((18)F-FDG-WBC) assessment were compared with histologic or biologic diagnosis in 15 patients and with clinical end-diagnosis after complete clinical work-up in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unknown etiology, 6 patients had documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> but with unknown extension of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e>, 4 patients had a documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with unfavorable evolution, and 2 patients had a documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with known extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity was obtained when a visual score of &gt;or=2 was chosen to identify increased tracer uptake as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With this threshold, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were each 86% on a patient-per-patient basis and 91%, 85%, and 90% on a lesion-per-lesion basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this small group of patients, the absence of areas with increased WBC uptake on WBC PET/CT had a 100% negative predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hybrid (18)F-FDG-WBC PET/CT was found to have a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It located infectious lesions with a high precision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this small series, absence of areas with increased uptake virtually ruled out the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG-WBC PET/CT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> detection deserves further investigation in a larger prospective series </plain></SENT>
