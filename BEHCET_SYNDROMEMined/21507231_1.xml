<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Currently, there is one <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) specific self reporting questionnaire developed and published in the literature, The Leeds BD-quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Arabic version of the Leeds BD-QoL METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 41 consecutive patients attending rheumatology clinics at the American University of Beirut Medical Center between June and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BD-QoL questionnaire, the Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaires were co-administered during the same visit, and severity scores were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cross-cultural adaptation of BD-QoL was performed using forward and backward translations of the original questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the final version were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to assess the dimensionality of the scale items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>External construct validity was examined by correlating Arabic BD-QoL with the severity score, ADL and IADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30 items of the adapted Arabic BD-QoL showed a high internal consistency (KR-20 coefficient 0.89) and test-retest reliability (Spearman's test 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The convergence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 items suggests that the 30-item adapted Arabic BD-QoL scale is unidimensional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BD-QoL did not correlate with any of the patients' demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Still, it was positively correlated with patient severity score (r 0.4, p 0.02), and IADL (but not ADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This cross-cultural adaptation has produced an Arabic BD-QoL questionnaire that is now available for use in clinical settings and in research studies, among Arabic speaking patients </plain></SENT>
