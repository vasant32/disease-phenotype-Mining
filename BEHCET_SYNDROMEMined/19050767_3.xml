<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies have shown a strong association of human leukocyte antigens-B51 (HLA-B51) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the association of non-HLA genes with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms of the Fc receptor-like 3 gene (FCRL3), -169C/T, -110A/G, +358C/G, and +1381A/G, have been reported to be associated with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine whether the polymorphisms of FCRL3 were associated with susceptibility to BD in a Chinese population mainly with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was performed in 245 Chinese BD patients and 289 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; -169C/T, -110A/G, +358C/G, and +1381A/G) in FCRL3 were detected using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 genotyping was performed by the PCR sequence specific primers method as described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed a significantly higher frequency of the G allele at the -110 site in BD patients compared with that in controls (corrected p=0.044, 75.3% versus 67.5%, chi2=7.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haplotype CGCG frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls (corrected p=0.0096) whereas haplotype TACG frequency was significantly lower in patients compared with controls (corrected p=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between clinical signs and FCRL3 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between patients and controls after HLA-B51 stratification concerning the four SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the -110 G allele and the haplotype CGCG of FCRL3 are positively associated with BD in a Chinese population and that the haplotype ATCG might be a protective haplotype for BD </plain></SENT>
