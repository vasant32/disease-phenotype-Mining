<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil abnormalities observed in BD patients even during clinical remission suggest prominent involvement of these phagocytic cells in the pathogenesis of the disease (Niwa et al., 1982) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify how HLA B51 antigen might confer susceptibility to BD, we have investigated neutrophil function in 13 B51-positive and 13 B51-negative healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte spontaneous proliferation and circulating immune complexes were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas neutrophils from B51-positive subjects showed an increase in the chemotactic response toward casein (P = 0.003) and LPS (P = 0.033) and also in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production (P = 0.008) no evidence of enhanced lymphocyte activation emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the HLA region can exert a regulatory control on PMN functions </plain></SENT>
