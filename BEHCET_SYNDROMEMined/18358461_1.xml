<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data which needs recognizing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the importance of making the right decision, the present work is carried out for searching better classification procedures for the Doppler ultrasound signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by the eigenvector methods and classification using the classifiers trained on the extracted features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is classification of the Doppler ultrasound signals by the combination of eigenvector methods and the classifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present research demonstrated that the power levels of the power spectral density (PSD) estimates obtained by the eigenvector methods are the features which well represent the Doppler ultrasound signals and the probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on these features achieved high classification accuracies </plain></SENT>
