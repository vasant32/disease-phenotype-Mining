<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between OS and myocardial perfusion, which is based on microvascular dysfunction, in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Material and method: Twenty-seven patients with BD (16 M, 11 F, mean age: 38.7 +/- 9.4 years) and 22 healthy volunteers (12 M, 10 F, mean age: 35.8 +/- 6.5 years) participated in our study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the comparison of myocardial perfusion scores, perfusion defect prevalence and OS parameters, there was a significant difference between the BD and control groups </plain></SENT>
