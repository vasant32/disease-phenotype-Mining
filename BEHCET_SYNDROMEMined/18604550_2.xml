<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell-activated protein C receptor (EPCR), which was discovered at the surface of endothelial cells, binds protein C and enhances its activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) has been detected in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> affecting multiple organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a common clinical manifestation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and the pathogenic mechanism of thrombotic tendency in the disease is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine sEPCR concentrations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with and without ocular involvement as well as to investigate the association between sEPCR levels and clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 67 healthy control subjects were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A complete ophthalmic examination was performed by ophthalmologists with an interest in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 30 patients with ocular involvement and Group 2 consisted of 30 patients without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Soluble EPCR levels were determined in plasma by using sEPCR Asserachrom enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Differences of the mean sEPCR levels between groups were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation analysis was used for evaluating the correlation between sEPCR levels and age, gender, duration of the disease as well as different clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age and gender ratio were not different between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Plasma sEPCR concentrations were significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than those in controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in serum sEPCR levels between the patients with versus the ones without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant correlations between sEPCR levels and age, gender, duration of the disease or clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests a possible role of soluble EPCR in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further studies by possible mutations and polymorphisms in EPCR gene in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease would be useful to bring to light the pathogenic mechanism of ocular and systemic vascular complications of the disease </plain></SENT>
