<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemokine levels except SDF-1 were significantly higher in the 3 disease groups than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, mean GRO-α levels were 15-fold higher than IL-8 levels and mean IP-10 levels were 22-fold higher than MIG levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with the same disease activity, AH levels of GRO-α and IP-10 were significantly higher in patients with BD than in patients with VKH disease and HLA-B27-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (p=0.0474; p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that GRO-α and IP-10 are the predominant CXC chemokines involved in neutrophil and activated T lymphocyte chemoattraction in endogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, particularly in BD </plain></SENT>
