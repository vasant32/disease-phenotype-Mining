<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients who were registered at the BD Specialty Clinic of Severance Hospital between 2004 and 2008 underwent FDG-PET scans to evaluate the cardiovascular presentations associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records and FDG-PET images of the patients were retrospectively reviewed to determine the clinical significance of the cardiovascular findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median quantitative FDG uptake index was 1.46 (range, 0.58-2.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FDG uptake was detected in multiple pseudoaneurysms, <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, and aneurysmatic dilation of the sinus of Valsalva, atherosclerotic change of the proximal ascending aorta associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The quantitative FDG uptake intensity was significantly associated with the ESR level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET scans may have clinical value as a workup study for patients with BD who have cardiovascular presentations </plain></SENT>
