<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of strong cross-reactivity among antigens comprising the B5 cross-reactive group (i.e., HLA-B5, B15, B18, and Bw35), we initiated a study of the chemical basis of cross-reactivity among this group of antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using classic serologic procedures, an 125I-Protein A binding assay, and chemical immunoprecipitation techniques, we have defined a new antigenic determinant, tentatively designated "Y," which is present on certain HLA-B molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By a series of sequential immuno-precipitation experiments, Y was shown to be a "public" antigenic determinant distinct from the "private" determinants B5, B15, B18, and Bw35, but present on the same 44,000 dalton <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although B5 is most highly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, other members of the B5 cross-reactive group have also been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s, albeit to a lesser extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These associations suggest that determinant Y may play a role in predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
