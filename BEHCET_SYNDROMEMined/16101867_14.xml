<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a major chemokine with pivotal effects concerning leukocytes and endothelial cells, has been found to be elevated in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the significance of elevated levels of IL-8 with respect to the activity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (37 males, 30 females; 32.5 +/- 9.3 years) were enrolled in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of active clinical manifestations at the time of serum sampling was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of association between disease activity and IL-8, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-8 increased as the number of clinically involved organs increased (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate showed no correlation with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the IL-8 level is a more sensitive marker of disease activity than the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be assumed that IL-8 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
