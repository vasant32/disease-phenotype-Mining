<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> (FM) in Korean patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and to evaluate the association between FM and clinical and psychological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy patients with BD were examined for FM tender points and asked to complete a Korean version of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fibromyalgia</z:e> Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was measured using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and a clinical activity score, which was calculated by summing the clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory (STAI) and Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI) were used for psychometric scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six BD patients (37.1%) met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients who met the criteria for FM were more frequently female, less frequently employed, and less well educated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, disease duration, clinical manifestations, medication, and measures of disease activity did not differ between BD patients with and without FM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, BD patients with FM had higher STAI and BDI scores than did patients without FM (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FM tender points were significantly correlated with the STAI and BDI, and not with disease activity variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FIQ scores were also strongly correlated with the STAI and BDI scores, and not with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FM was very common among BD patients and was associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and not with disease activity </plain></SENT>
