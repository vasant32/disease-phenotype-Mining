<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No increase of these antibodies was detected in the cases compared to 55 healthy unrelated blood donors from the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding is in contrast with the correlation between Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies and BD as reported in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It seems that environmental factors may contribute to disease expression in different populations, producing different effects according to the individual's genetic predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies do not seem to be of any significance in the Greek population </plain></SENT>
