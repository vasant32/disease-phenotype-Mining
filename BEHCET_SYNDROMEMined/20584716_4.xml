<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the relationship between the serum concentration of infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α), and its effectiveness in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied 20 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who had been treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After informed consent was obtained, samples of the peripheral blood were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors began collecting blood samples after at least 4 months of infliximab infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first sample was collected at 1 h after an infliximab infusion (Day 0), then after 4 weeks (Week 4), and finally at 1 h prior to the infliximab infusion 8 weeks later (Week 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were collected from the clinical charts of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration of infliximab was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean serum concentration of infliximab in the 20 patients was 117.4 ± 28.2 μg/ml on Day 0, 11.4 ± 6.8 μg/ml on Week 4 and 6.3 ± 4.8 μg/ml on Week 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration of infliximab in each patient was significantly correlated with its effectiveness in resolving the recurrent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Monitoring infliximab serum concentrations is useful in determining the effectiveness of infliximab treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
