<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As it is now known that the B51 antigen can be encoded by 21 alleles, B*5101-B*5121, we performed HLA-B*51 allele genotyping among 58 Greek patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After serological HLA typing, typing of HLA-B*51 alleles was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-sequencing-based typing (PCR-SBT) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the B51 antigen was found to be significantly higher in the patient group as compared with the control group (75.9% of patients vs 22.0% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the genotyping of B51 alleles, 34 out of 44 B51-positive patients possessed B*5101, 13 out of the 44 carried B*5108 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 9 B51-positive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls carried B*5101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study revealed a strong association between Greeks with BD, both B*5101, B*5108, provided important insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the association between HLA status, this disease </plain></SENT>
