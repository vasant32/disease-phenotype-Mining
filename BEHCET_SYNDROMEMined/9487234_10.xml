<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of rheumatology consultations, along with the diagnoses, and abnormal results on serologic testing in Gulf War veterans evaluated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282550" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gulf War syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of the first 250 consecutive Gulf War veterans referred to the comprehensive clinical evaluation program at Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center and Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, Tex, were reviewed for demographic characteristics and frequency of subspecialty consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of rheumatic diagnoses and the frequency of abnormal serologic test results was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 250 Gulf War veterans evaluated in the comprehensive clinical evaluation program, 139 (56%) were referred for rheumatology consultation, which was the most common elective subspecialty referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients evaluated, 82 (59%) had soft tissue syndromes, 19 (14%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, and 38 (27%) had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common soft tissue syndromes were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">patellofemoral syndrome</z:e> (33 patients [25%]), mechanical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo> (23 patients [18%]), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> (22 patients [17%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, 10 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001997'>gout</z:hpo>, and 1 each had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, parvovirus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, psoriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020676" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypothyroid</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal serologic test results were common among the Gulf War patients regardless of the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rheumatic manifestations in Gulf War veterans are similar to symptoms and diagnoses described in previous wars and are not unique to active duty soldiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the results of serologic screening were poor predictors of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
