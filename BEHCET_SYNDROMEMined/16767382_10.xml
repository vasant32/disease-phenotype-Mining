<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the mechanisms involved in the development of neovascularization of the optic disc (NVD) in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to evaluate the effects of medical and laser treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 26 consecutive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients (38 eyes) with NVD who presented between 1990 and 2004 at our university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on age at presentation, sex, disease duration, laterality of NVD, ocular findings, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographic findings, visual acuity, medical treatment, laser photocoagulation, surgical procedures, and the follow-up period was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eyes with diffuse capillary leakage on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography were defined as having <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced NVD, and eyes with extensive <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> capillary nonperfusion were defined as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced NVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients were male, and eight were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age at presentation was 25.4 +/- 4.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median disease duration was 5.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had bilateral NVD; 14 had unilateral NVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp>-induced NVD was seen in 87% of the eyes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced NVD in 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> combined with conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> was effective in 45% of the eyes with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced NVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> laser photocoagulation was effective in three of five eyes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced NVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with interferon alpha-2a resulted in resolution of NVD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients who received this agent for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>- or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced persistent NVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Final visual acuity was less than 0.1 in 24% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory mechanisms seem to predominate in the pathogenesis of NVD in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that the response to intensive anti-inflammatory and conventional immunosuppressive treatment is not satisfactory; <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> laser photocoagulation may be ineffective even in eyes with <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp>, but interferon alpha-2a seems to be effective for the treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with NVD </plain></SENT>
