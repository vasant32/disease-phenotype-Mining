<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of rheumatological findings and the status of bone metabolism in this disease are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory diseases</z:e> may predispose to a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and there are many studies concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate BMD and bone turnover markers in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty BD patients (17 male and 13 female patients, mean age 36.9+/-12.6 years) and a total of 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (17 male and 13 female controls, mean age 34.9+/-8.95 years) recruited from the general population were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine (L1-4) and the left hip (total hip) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were collected between 8 and 10 am after overnight fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), parathormone (PTH), total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Free deoxypyridinoline cross-links (DPD) in second-void urine and total daily urinary calcium excretion were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in lumbar spine or femoral BMD and bone turnover markers were found between BD patients and control groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although it is difficult to draw definite conclusions because of the limited number of patients involved, our study indicates that bone mineral density and bone turnover markers in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were no different than in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
