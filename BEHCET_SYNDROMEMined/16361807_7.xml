<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If a patient of RAU without any other typical symptoms of BD has gastrointestinal symptoms, it is difficult to distinguish this RAU from true BD with gastrointestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because pathognomonic clinical features and tools are absent, the differential diagnosis of these two diseases relies on the characteristic clinical features and the judgement of an experienced physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five out of a total 960 RAU patients and forty-four of 556 BD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms between January 1996 and December 2003 participated in this study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic findings were analyzed and ELISA tests were conducted to detect serum levels of ASCA and pANCA </plain></SENT>
