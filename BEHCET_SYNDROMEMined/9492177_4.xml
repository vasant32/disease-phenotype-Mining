<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The production of IgA protease in twelve strains of Streptococcus sanguis isolated from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protease activity was detected in 10 out of 12 strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protease was purified from one representative strain, S. sanguis 113-20, by employing Rotofor and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-Sephacel chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular mass of the purified protease was approximately 100 kDa, and it cleaved the proline-threonine site of the IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both IgG and IgA titers against the cells (113-20) and the purified IgA protease in the sera of BD patients and healthy controls, 36 each, were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgG titers against the cells and protease were not significant in the BD patients or controls, but the IgA titers against the cells and protease in the BD patients were significantly higher than those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the BD patients are infected with IgA protease-producing S. sanguis strains, which cause an increase of IgA titer against these organisms and IgA protease antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the organisms can proliferate in BD patients for a long period of time (years), it seems that IgA antibodies cannot effectively eliminate the organisms </plain></SENT>
