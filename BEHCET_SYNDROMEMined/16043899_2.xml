<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the length of the follow-up period of patients on the frequencies of clinical features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 231 patients who applied to our dermatology clinic from June of 1991 to October of 1996, only 52 patients that were followed up for at least five years were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline characteristics of these 52 patients were almost the same as those of the 179 patients who dropped out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the frequencies of clinical features at the end of the follow-up period of five years were higher than those at the time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most prominent increases were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (59.6% to 75.0%), papulopustular lesions (84.6% to 94.2%), and large vessel involvement (23.1% to 30.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to our results, it is most likely that studies mainly including mostly patients with long-standing disease will report higher figures for the frequencies of these clinical features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
