<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 3 patients were affected with severe persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> that was refractory to common <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi>, and 1 patient had recurrent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, MRI on 5 patients, and CT on 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT was performed using a high-resolution, brain-dedicated camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After conventional visual analysis by 2 expert readers, 2 transaxial sections were drawn parallel to the bicommissural line: the first across the thalami and the second across the temporal lobe at the level of the mesiotemporal structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cortical regions of interest were drawn automatically on the cortical ribbon on the 2 sections, whereas other regions of interest were drawn by hand around the basal ganglia, the thalami, and the mesiotemporal structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry analysis was then applied, and hypoperfusion was considered when the asymmetry value was &gt;10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hypoperfusion was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by visual and asymmetry analyses; this finding was localized mainly in the basal ganglia, the thalami, and the temporal cortex, including its mesial portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Temporal hypoperfusion was found primarily in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and hypoperfusion of deep gray nuclei was found mainly in the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography disclosed brain functional impairment in 5 of 6 patients, where- as MRI showed multiple bilateral white matter lesions in 1 patient suffering from persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As in adults, perfusion SPECT seems to be very sensitive in disclosing brain abnormalities in children and adolescents with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and signs or symptoms of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, even with negative findings on brain MRI </plain></SENT>
