<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the occurrence of the symptoms retrospectively in chronologic order in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 60 consecutive patients (29 male and 31 female; aged 35.87 +/- 9.84 years) were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of the disease were retrospectively recorded in the time order of the manifestations per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcer</z:hpo> was the most commonly observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> manifestation (51 of 60 patients: 85%), followed by genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (13 of 60 patients: 21.7%) and articular symptoms (10 of 60 patients: 16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> and the fulfillment of diagnostic criteria was calculated to be 3.77 +/- 4.43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same duration was 2.50 +/- 4.74 and 2.11 +/- 3.44 years for genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and articular symptoms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration between the time point of fulfillment of diagnostic criteria and the diagnosis (2.83 +/- 2.3 years) was found to be longer in female patients (3.2 +/- 2.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration was also longer in patients having only mucocutaneous lesions (3.18 +/- 2.5 years) than in patients having serious organ involvement such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> (1.63 +/- 0.7 years; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> is the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> manifestation in the majority of the patients and the disease is often diagnosed with a delay of several years after the appearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> sign </plain></SENT>
