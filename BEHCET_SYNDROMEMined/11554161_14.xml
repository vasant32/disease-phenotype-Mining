<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histologic nature of these lesions has been a matter of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish their distinguishing features, biopsy specimens from nodular lesions of 24 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, 25 with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (NV), and 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis revealed insignificant differences between most of the histologic features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çed syndrome and NV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, neutrophil-predominating infiltrate in the subcutis was more common in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, while <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and granuloma formation were encountered more frequently in NV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çed syndrome and EN were more significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Septal <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp>, lymphocyte-predominating infiltrate, absence of many vascular changes as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were features in favor of EN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nodular lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome are mainly neutrophilic vascular reactions with histologic features similar to NV but significantly differing from EN associated with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
