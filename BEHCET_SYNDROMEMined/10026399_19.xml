<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> resulting from many factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We conducted this study to show if there is any change of plasma <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate levels by using the enzymatic-spectrophotometric method as an indicator for nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production, considering the disease activity in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted 21 patients and 20 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate levels, and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-2-macroglobulin and the neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn before and after treatment of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi>, nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> + nitrate levels in the active period of the disease were found to be decreased compared to the inactive period and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in plasma <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and nitrate levels between the inactive period and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was concluded that decreased NO production in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may have critical biological activities relevant to pathologic events in the active period of the disease </plain></SENT>
