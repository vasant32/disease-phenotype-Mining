<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also very difficult to distinguish the gastrointestinal involvement of BD from that of CD in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, this study aimed to investigate a possible involvement of the common CD-predisposing CARD15 variants in the genetic susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 85 consecutive patients with BD (51 male, 34 female) of Turkish origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of them had intestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of 100 ethnically matched, non-related healthy volunteers were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were genotyped for 3 common CARD15 variants (R702W, G908R, and Ll007fsinsC) using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the three CARD15 variants predisposing to CD was observed in patients with BD, including two patients with intestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The R702W mutation was observed in I healthy chromosome, and the 3020insC mutation in 2 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No individual was found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for these variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 3 most common CD-predisposing CARD15 variants do not constitute a genetic susceptibility factor for BD in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies would be helpful to rule out a possible contribution of other rare or unknown variants and/or the effects of different ethnic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
