<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The finding of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> led us to perform systematic renal biopsies in ten other patients with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>Proteinuria</z:hpo> was found in five, two of whom had associated <z:mp ids='MP_0011418'>leukocyturia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy mesangial and extramembranous glomerular deposits were observed in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterioles in ten patients showed subendothelial and medial hyaline deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A granular pattern of fluorescent staining identified the presence of the third component of complement in these deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circulating immune deposits were sought and found in six out of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of circulating immune complexes and deposition of complement in glomerular and arteriolar tissues supports an immune complex mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and is consistent with the hypothesis of an immunological pathogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
