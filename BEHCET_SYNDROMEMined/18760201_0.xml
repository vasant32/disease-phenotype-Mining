<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been few studies in the literature evaluating the effect of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) on tendons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we planned to search for the involvement of hand and foot tendons in BD by using ultrasonography and to determine the relation of tendon involvement with clinical measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of 33 randomly selected BD patients and 36 voluntary healthy controls matched by age and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sonographic evaluations were performed from hands (flexor digitorum süperficialis (2-5), flexor digitorum profundus (2-5), flexor carpi radialis) and Achilles tendons of the nondominant extremities using an 8-10 MHz linear array probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grip strength and crepitation were also measured on the nondominant side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean hand and foot tendon thickness values of BD patients were significantly higher than in control group (p=0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease duration, age, and presence of crepitation were not correlated with tendon thickness in the BD group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p values&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grip strength values were lower in the BD group than in control group but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.344) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grip strength values were not correlated with hand tendon thicknesses in BD groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p values&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because tendons tears and thicknesses are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, awareness of tendon pathologies is very important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It would be of value to investigate this relationship in future studies in order to determine if this increment in tendon thickness is an indicator of disease activity and affects prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The physician should be on alert about tendon involvement even if the patient has no complaints </plain></SENT>
