<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte GGT activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was found to be significantly lower than that of control lymphocytes (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This altered activity may be due to the abnormality in the membrane of lymphocytes of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients </plain></SENT>
