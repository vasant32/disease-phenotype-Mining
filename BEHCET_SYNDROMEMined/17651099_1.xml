<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of 20 patients with BD and 18 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD11b and CD63 on the surface of granulocytes and monocytes were measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RV and LV diastolic functions were assessed by tricuspid and mitral annular tissue Doppler recordings, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Backscatter cyclic variation (CV) and maximal intensity (IB) were measured in RV lateral wall, interventricular septum, and posterior LV wall from parasternal long-axis view, apex from apical four-chamber view, anterior, inferior, and lateral LV walls from parasternal short axis view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD11b on granulocytes and CD63 on monocytes in BD patients was higher than those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD had smaller mitral and tricuspid annular early diastolic wave velocities and early/late diastolic wave velocity ratios (E/A) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MFI of CD11b and CD63 was inversely correlated with tricuspid and mitral annular E/A in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CV of RV and global CV of LV were found to be diminished in BD patients than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CV of RV and global CV of LV showed a direct correlation with tricuspid and mitral annular E/A ratio, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is an association between the levels of cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, deterioration of diastolic function, and altered myocardial ultrasonic reflectivity in BD </plain></SENT>
