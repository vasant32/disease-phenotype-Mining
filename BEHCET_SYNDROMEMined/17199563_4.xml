<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T cells in this disease proliferate vigorously in response to a specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) 60 in an antigen-specific fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is a cytokine participating in the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the prominent features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) may play a role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by inhibiting production of prostacyclin by endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of HSP60, VEGF and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and their relation to clinical manifestations and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were included; 17 were in the active stage and 13 were in the inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete clinical examination and Doppler examination were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of HSP60, VEGF and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of HSP60, VEGF and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were significantly higher in patients than in controls; however, their level did not correlate with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The serum level of VEGF correlated significantly with the presence of vascular manifestations and ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The serum level of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> was greater in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HSP60 has an important role in aetiopathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, which sheds new light on its autoimmune nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An elevated serum level of VEGF may be a risk factor for the development of ocular disease contributing to poor visual outcome </plain></SENT>
