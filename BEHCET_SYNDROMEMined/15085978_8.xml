<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> is not common in western Europe and the disease presentation is less obvious than in "endemic" countries such as Turkey and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This makes the diagnosis more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis is important, as the prognosis is better if therapy is started early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New methods such as ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiography (ICGA) can improve the characterisation and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to present our experience with these new methods as well as HLA-B51 testing in the appraisal of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients seen by the authors between 1997 and 2001 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> or suspected <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and who underwent ICG angiography or UBM were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and signs, results of laboratory work-up including HLA-B51 antigen testing and the delay to diagnosis, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> and ICG angiography and UBM testing were performed according to standard protocols used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients and their contribution towards diagnosis and management were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was non granulomatous in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography showed moderate to severe diffuse <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> compatible with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 testing was positive in 5 of 7 tested cases, being useful to orient the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>UBM contributed to the diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five tested cases, being the determining element in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It allowed redirection of the diagnosis from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pars planitis</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's in 2 patients with poorly transparent media because it failed to show the typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pars planitis</z:e> deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In a case originally diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's it allowed correction of the diagnosis to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030593" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pars planitis</z:e> because of the presence of the typical UBM pars plana depositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography allowed detection of choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five tested cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients who did not present with a full-blown clinical picture, as they are often seen in non-endemic areas, UBM examination and HLA-B51 testing were valuable additional diagnostic elements helping to redirect the diagnosis correctly and to reduce the diagnostic delay in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The hitherto unknown choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> shown by ICG angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five investigated patients indicates that choroidal involvement probably occurs in most newly diagnosed <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
