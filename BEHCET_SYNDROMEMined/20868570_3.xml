<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was set up to investigate the contribution of SUMO4 locus to the genetic susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five Tunisian BD patients and 167 healthy blood donors from the same geographical area were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction for the SUMO4 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SUMO4+438 C allele frequency is significantly increased in BD patients (p=0.03; χ2=4.71; OR=1.44; 95% CI=1.02-2.04) and highly significantly increased in HLA-B51 positive BD patients (p=3 10-6; χ2=21.62; OR=4.44; 95% CI=2.21-8.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the SUMO4 -847 G allele frequency is significantly increased in BD patients (p=0.03; χ2=4.34; OR=1.41; 95% CI=1.01-1.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The studied polymorphisms were also associated with disease severity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SUMO4+438 C and -847 G alleles seem to be associated with susceptibility to BD in Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that SUMO4 gene polymorphisms may be involved in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, vascular BD, as well as the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
