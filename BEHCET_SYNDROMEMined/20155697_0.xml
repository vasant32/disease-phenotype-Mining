<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few cases of involvement of the nasal mucosa have been reported in the literature, and its true prevalence is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a cross-sectional study of 400 consecutively presenting patients with confirmed <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (according to classification-tree criteria) to determine the incidence of nasal mucosal involvement, to identify its particular characteristics, and to determine if there are any statistically significant differences in clinical and paraclinical parameters between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease patients with nasal involvement and those without </plain></SENT>
