<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of infliximab therapy for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled six patients who failed to respond to conventional immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) were administered at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome variables were visual acuity, control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, reduction of macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, tapering of immunosuppressive therapy, and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 16 to 36 months (mean +/- SD, 23 +/- 7.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of infliximab infusions ranged from 10 to 23 (14 +/- 4.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the 2-month follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had achieved remission, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> had resolved, and visual acuity had improved dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Throughout the follow-up period, three patients remained attack-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had one relapse, and another patient had two relapses before the scheduled infusions; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three relapses resolved rapidly after the subsequent infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed five relapses, and infusions at 6-week intervals were necessary to achieve sustained remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period, visual acuity improved in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy was substantially reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> developed in two patients who received 17 and 23 infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No major adverse effects requiring withdrawal of infliximab were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab is efficient and safe for long-term treatment of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Repeated infusions are required to maintain long-term remission </plain></SENT>
