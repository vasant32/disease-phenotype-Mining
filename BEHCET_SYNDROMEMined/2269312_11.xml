<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to categorize the diverse neurological manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, a group of 10 patients was prospectively studied; the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome was not known in any of them prior to their neurological presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reasonably clear distinction can be made to divide the manifestations into three general categories with some overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Category I includes patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> with or without cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Category II are those presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Category III are those patients who present with spinal cord involvement and CSF pleocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brainstem involvement was noted independently of the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, patients with Neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome showed little ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The course of the illness both in morbidity and mortality tended to be better in category I, and mortality was only seen in category II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In populations susceptible to the disease, the clinical categorisation proposed may alert the clinician to the possibility of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome whenever patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e>, dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the young, unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelitis</z:e> or possible multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> are encountered </plain></SENT>
