<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutrophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, which is a consequence of immunological events, is suggested as the underlying pathophysiological mechanism </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 75 patients with BD (45 women and 30 men) and 25 age-matched and gender-matched healthy control volunteers (13 women and 12 men) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BD patients were divided into three groups according to their clinical findings: inactive BD patients (group 1, n=25); active BD patients under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment (group 2, n=25); and active BD patients without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment (group 3, n=25) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between p-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> levels and disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was evaluated and correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD had significantly higher p-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> levels (20.6+/-6.3 U/l) than control subjects (12.8+/-1.8 U/l; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The p-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> levels of patients with active BD were significantly (for each, P&lt;0.05) higher than those of inactive BD patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the difference was not significant (P&gt;0.05) between active patients with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
