<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) is a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> with unknown aetiology, where, besides genetic predisposition, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> involving T and B lymphocytes and <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> neutrophils contribute to disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from BD patients with pulmonary manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BAL was performed in 27 patients with BD and pulmonary manifestations, 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>Rheumatoid Arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and 23 healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Related orphan receptor C (RORC) and forkheadbox P3 (FOXP3) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcript were determined in BAL by reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NK cells, NK cell cytotoxicity, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity against K562 cells were measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportions of NK precursors and expression of genes for IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2Rbeta; CD122), perforin, and granzyme in NK cells were measured by flow cytometry or RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis of transcription factors revealed an increase in the RORC/FOXP3 ratio (Th17/Treg cells) in BAL from BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Percentages of NK were significantly lower in BD than in RA patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Purified NK cells derived from BD patients were found to have lower cytotoxicity and LAK activity than those from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This defect of NK cells in BD patients was related to down-regulation of perforin and granzyme expression in NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In BD patients, the increased RORC/FOXP3 ratio indicated an inflammatory state of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NK cells were decreased together with an impairment of their activity due to a defective expression of granzyme and perforin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities possibly contribute to immune system dysregulation found in BAL of BD patients with pulmonary manifestations </plain></SENT>
