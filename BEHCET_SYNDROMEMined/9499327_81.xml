<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Uncontrolled experience suggests that thalidomide may help prevent recurrences of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of two thalidomide dosages in the treatment of mucocutaneous lesions of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Specialist outpatient clinic for the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 96 male patients with the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome who primarily had mucocutaneous lesions without major organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Thalidomide, 100 mg/d or 300 mg/d, or placebo for 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Sustained absence of any oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> during treatment (complete response) and changes in the number of mucocutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An additional evaluation was done 4 weeks after treatment ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A complete response occurred in 2 of the 32 patients (6% [95% CI, 0.8% to 20.8%]) receiving thalidomide, 100 mg/d; in 5 of the 31 patients (16% [CI, 5.5% to 33.7%]) receiving thalidomide, 300 mg/d; and in none of the 32 patients (0% [CI, 0% to 10.9%]) receiving placebo (P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The suppressive effect of thalidomide with either dosage was evident at 4 weeks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) and at 8 weeks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) and follicular lesions (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect persisted during treatment but diminished rapidly after treatment was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both thalidomide dosages led to significant increases in the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum lesions during the first 8 weeks of treatment (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>Polyneuropathy</z:hpo> developed in 4 patients (1 in the 100-mg/d group and 3 in the 300-mg/d group); in 3 of these patients, the condition was diagnosed after the trial had ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide is effective for treating the oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and follicular lesions of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A dosage of 100 mg/d is as effective as a dosage of 300 mg/day </plain></SENT>
