<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We rapport here a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> presenting with neurological complications who made a remarkable recovery to high dose steroids and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to initiation of steroid therapy the percentage of T lymphocytes (OKT3) was low, that of helper T lymphocytes (OKT4) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and suppressor T lymphocytes (OKT8) was slightly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The OKT4: OKT8 ratio was slightly reduced and the percentage of B lymphocytes was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With steroid therapy there was an increase in the percentage of OKT3 and fall in the percentages of OKT4 and OKT8 and the OKT4: OKT8 ratio was maintained fairly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of B lymphocytes was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On addition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> the percentage of OKT3 and OKT8 were substantially increased and the percentage of OKT4 was slightly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The net result was a significant reduction in the OKT4: OKT8 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of B lymphocytes remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On reviewing the absolute counts there was a paradoxical rise in OKT4 and OKT8 a week after high dose steroid therapy due to a substantial rise in the total number of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On reducing the dose of steroids the absolute count of OKT4 and OKT8 decreased in parallel with their percentages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A disparity was noted in the percentage of OKT3 and the sum of the percentages of OKT4 and OKT8, prior to commencement of therapy which was significantly reduced after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is likely that this disparity is due to the presence of doubly labelled cells (cortical thymocytes) released into circulation prematurely </plain></SENT>
