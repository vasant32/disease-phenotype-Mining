<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the prevalence of anti-cyclic citrullinated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>) antibodies in a large group of Korean patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), with and without joint involvement, and to compare these findings with the prevalences of anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested 189 patients with BD, 105 with RA, and 36 with SLE for anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies and IgM rheumatoid factor in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the medical records of patients with BD to investigate their personal and clinical characteristics as well as their laboratory test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies were detected in seven of the 189 BD patients (3.7%), at a mean titer of 30.6±44.4 U/mL, in 86 of the 105 RA patients (81.9%) with a mean titer of 198.8±205.7 U/mL, and in nine of the 36 SLE patients (25%) with a mean titer of 180.4±113.9 U/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the seven anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>-positive BD patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for both BD and RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the seven anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>-positive BD patients (71.4%) had polyarticular joint involvement, and the other two patients (28.6%) had oligoarticular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We determined the prevalence of anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies in a large group of Korean BD patients with and without joint involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Negative anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> test in patients with BD may help to differentiate BD from RA and SLE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which present with similar clinical features </plain></SENT>
