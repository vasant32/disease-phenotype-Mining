<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), induces some of the clinical symptoms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in a rat animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results led to the hypothesis that LTA may also trigger BD in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the humoral and cellular immune response against LTA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) in patients with BD, and compared these responses with those of patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (OU) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples were obtained from 12 active BD, 12 inactive BD, 12 active OU and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-LTA, anti-LPS antibodies levels and the capacity of immune complexes anti-LTA IgG-LTA to activate complement were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> residues in anti-LTA IgG were analyzed in the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures after LTA and LPS stimulation was also studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The capacity to bind <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> binding protein (MBP) of anti-LTA IgGs was significantly higher in BD and active OU patients relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, only active BD patients generated significantly higher levels of C5a than controls (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IgGs purified from the sera of BD patients showed a high specificity for LTA from Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus faecalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LTA also stimulates the secretion of IL-8 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-LPS IgA and IgG titers were significantly higher only in active OU patients relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.0018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest a mechanism involving LTA from streptococci in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
