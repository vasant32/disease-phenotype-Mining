<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the neuro-otological findings in 26 consecutive patients with definite and probable <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome unselected for audiovestibular complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Auditory and/or vestibular abnormalities were found in 19 (73 per cent) patients, with auditory involvement in 14 (54 per cent) and vestibular in 10 (38.5 per cent) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral involvement was more common than central involvement for both auditory and vestibular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral cochlear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> was the most common audiological finding, whereas unilateral peripheral dysfunction was the prevailing vestibular abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation has been found between audiovestibular lesions and other organ lesions, disease duration or age or sex of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a lack of interdependence between cochlear and vestibular labyrinthine lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a full neuro-otological assessment in patients under investigation for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome may reveal labyrinth involvement in a substantial proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the absence of a specific diagnostic test for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, audiovestibular lesions may provide further diagnostic support for this disorder </plain></SENT>
