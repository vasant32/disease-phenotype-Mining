<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and pseudoaneurysms in the major arterial systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of 30 BD patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or pseudoaneurysms in the major arterial systems were reviewed to determine the clinical characteristics of BD, the sites and types of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or pseudoaneurysms, laboratory test results, and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and pseudoaneurysms (32 saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, eight fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and seven pseudoaneurysms) were detected in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and pseudoaneurysms (27 patients, 90%) had not ruptured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic lesions presented in 21 patients (70%), and asymptomatic lesions were incidentally detected in nine (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 30 patients (33.3%) presented two or more aneurysmal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was observed in five patients (16.7%) after treatment with stent graft (n = 3), graft interposition (n = 1), or graft embolization (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that BD patients diagnosed with major arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> should be further evaluated to detect possible associated venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> formations or aneurysmal lesions at other sites </plain></SENT>
