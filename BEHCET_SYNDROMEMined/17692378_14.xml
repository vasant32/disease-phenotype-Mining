<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred seventy-five eyes of 437 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease initially examined from August, 1995, through June, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The history, demographic parameters, and clinical findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients referred to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> study center of Sun Yat-sen University were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser flare-cell photometry (LFCM), fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography (FFA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), and B-scan ultrasonography were performed in certain cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients were treated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> combined with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics, clinical presentation, and auxiliary examination findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 319 male and 118 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>Panuveitis</z:hpo> was the most common type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in both genders, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> was seen more frequently in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011531'>vitreitis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> were the most common ocular manifestations in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>Cataract</z:hpo> and macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> were the most common complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Oral aphthae</z:e> were the most frequent extraocular manifestation, followed by dermatologic lesions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results of FFA, OCT, B-scan ultrasonography, LFCM, and UBM generally were in accordance with or comparable with clinical observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the final visit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was well controlled in 86.2% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, 20.4% of eyes became legally blind despite aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the risk of losing useful vision (0.05) at 5 and 10 years for males and females as 29% versus 6% and 65% versus 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Chinese patients mainly manifests as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007813'>nongranulomatous uveitis</z:hpo> frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e> and dermatologic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, B-scan ultrasonography, LFCM, UBM, and OCT may provide much information about pathophysiologic hallmarks of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> with other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> is effective for most patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Males had a more severe course and were at higher risk for losing vision than females </plain></SENT>
